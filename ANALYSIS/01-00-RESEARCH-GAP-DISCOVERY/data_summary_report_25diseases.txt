REAL GBD 2021 CSV DATA INTEGRATION
================================================================================

DATA SOURCE UPGRADE:
• Previous version used estimated/approximated disease burden values
• Current version uses REAL GBD 2021 data from user-provided CSV
• All 25 diseases successfully mapped to authoritative GBD data
• Extraction: Global, Both sexes, All ages, Number metric, 2021

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
• Deaths data: Direct from GBD 2021 (not WHO estimates)
• DALYs data: Direct from GBD 2021 (most current available)
• Prevalence data: Direct from GBD 2021 (actual counts)
• Data currency: 2021 (most recent complete GBD dataset)

DISEASE MAPPING ACCURACY:
• 25/25 diseases successfully mapped from script names to GBD names
• Examples: "Lung Cancer" → "Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer"
• Examples: "Road Traffic Accidents" → "Road injuries"
• Examples: "Alzheimer Disease" → "Alzheimer's disease and other dementias"

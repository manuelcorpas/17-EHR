============================================

This database uses REAL disease burden data from GBD 2021 CSV:
EXPANDED to 25 diseases for comprehensive global health coverage.

PRIMARY DATA SOURCES:
1. Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (IHME) - FROM UPLOADED CSV

     369 diseases and injuries in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2021
   - Data extraction: Global, Both sexes, All ages, 2021

2. Disease Mapping: Script disease names mapped to GBD CSV disease names
   - Ischemic Heart Disease → Ischemic heart disease
   - Depression → Depressive disorders  
   - Lung Cancer → Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer
   - Road Traffic Accidents → Road injuries
   - And 21 additional precise mappings

3. MeSH Terms
   - Source: Curated from established medical literature and MeSH hierarchy
   - Method: Manual curation based on authoritative medical terminology
   - Note: No real-time API validation used - ensures transparency

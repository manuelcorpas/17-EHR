systematic exclusion of populations,patterns consistent with systematic underrepresentation of populations,13,Avoids implying intentional exclusion; acknowledges pattern without causal claim
reveals structural inequity,identifies structural patterns in research allocation,13,Descriptive rather than normative framing
"demonstrates what sustained investment, open data policies, and global collaboration can achieve","correlates with higher EAS, consistent with the hypothesis that sustained investment and open data policies contribute to equity alignment",14,Removes unsupported causal attribution; presents as hypothesis
confirms the systematic neglect,is consistent with systematic neglect,13,Epistemic hedge; data consistent with but does not prove
proves that,suggests that,13,Observational data cannot prove causation
reflects deep-rooted bias,"may reflect structural factors including resource constraints, research priorities, and institutional capacity",13,Acknowledges alternative explanations
directly demonstrates exclusion,reveals patterns consistent with differential attention,13,Pattern description rather than mechanism claim
measures equity in biobank research,measures alignment between biobank research output and global disease burden,1-2,"Clarifies that HEIM measures topic allocation, not broader equity dimensions"
comprehensive equity metric,disease-burden alignment metric,1-2,Avoids overstating scope; equity is multidimensional
global biobank equity,global biobank research-burden alignment,1-2,Precise terminology for what HEIM actually measures

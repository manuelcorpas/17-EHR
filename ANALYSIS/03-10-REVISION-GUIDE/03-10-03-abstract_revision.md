## Revised Abstract

**Background:** The rapid proliferation of population biobanks has transformed 
genomic research, yet it remains unclear whether research outputs align with 
global health priorities. We present the Health Equity Informative Metrics 
(HEIM) framework for quantifying alignment between biobank research output 
and global disease burden.

**Methods:** We analyzed [N] publications from [N] biobanks registered with 
the International Health Cohorts Consortium (IHCC), mapping research output 
to 175 disease categories from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study. We 
computed burden-weighted research gap scores for each disease and Equity 
Alignment Scores (EAS) for each biobank. Bootstrap 95% confidence intervals 
were calculated using [N] iterations with percentile method.

**Findings:** [Key findings with specific numbers]

**Interpretation:** These metrics quantify disease-area alignment with global 
burden; they do not assess research quality, participant-level diversity, 
governance equity, or translational impact. The observed patterns are 
consistent with systematic underrepresentation of high-burden diseases 
prevalent in low- and middle-income settings, though alternative explanations 
including differential research capacity and funding priorities warrant 
consideration. HEIM provides a foundation for monitoring progress toward 
more globally aligned biobank research agendas.

**Funding:** [Funding sources]

## Key Changes

1. Changed "quantifying equity" to "quantifying alignment between research 
   output and global disease burden"

2. Added explicit scope statement: "These metrics quantify disease-area 
   alignment with global burden; they do not assess research quality, 
   participant-level diversity, governance equity, or translational impact"

3. Softened causal language: "consistent with systematic underrepresentation" 
   instead of "demonstrates systematic neglect"

4. Acknowledged alternative explanations in the Interpretation

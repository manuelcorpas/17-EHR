RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Increase awareness of underrepresented bias types, especially Batch Effects
2. Standardize bias reporting across all biobanks
3. Implement systematic bias assessment protocols
4. Enhance diversity and inclusion in recruitment strategies
5. Develop bias mitigation guidelines specific to biobank research

All of Us,27532667,A Survey of U.S Adults' Opinions about Conduct of a Nationwide Precision Medicine Initiative® Cohort Study of Genes and Environment.,"A survey of a population-based sample of U.S adults was conducted to measure their attitudes about, and inform the design of the Precision Medicine Initiative's planned national cohort study. An online survey was conducted by GfK between May and June of 2015. The influence of different consent models on willingness to share data was examined by randomizing participants to one of eight consent scenarios. Of 4,777 people invited to take the survey, 2,706 responded and 2,601 (54% response rate) provided valid responses. Most respondents (79%) supported the proposed study, and 54% said they would definitely or probably participate if asked. Support for and willingness to participate in the study varied little among demographic groups; younger respondents, LGBT respondents, and those with more years of education were significantly more likely to take part if asked. The most important study incentive that the survey asked about was learning about one's own health information. Willingness to share data and samples under broad, study-by-study, menu and dynamic consent models was similar when a statement about transparency was included in the consent scenarios. Respondents were generally interested in taking part in several governance functions of the cohort study. A large majority of the U.S. adults who responded to the survey supported a large national cohort study. Levels of support for the study and willingness to participate were both consistent across most demographic groups. The opportunity to learn health information about one's self from the study appears to be a strong motivation to participate.",PloS one,2016,Adult; Aged; Attitude; Cohort Studies; Community Participation; Female; Gene-Environment Interaction; Humans; Informed Consent; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; National Health Programs; Precision Medicine; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; Young Adult,False,2

A cornerstone of the initiative is the PMI All of Us Research Program (formerly known as PMI-Cohort Program) which will create a cohort of 1 million volunteers who will contribute their health data and biospecimens to a centralized national database to support precision medicine research. The PMI All of US Research Program is the largest longitudinal study in the history of the United States. The designers of the Program anticipated and addressed some of the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) associated with the initiative. To date, however, there is no plan to call for research regarding ELSI associated with the Program-PMI All of Us program. Based on analysis of National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding announcements for the PMI All of Us program, we have identified three ELSI themes: cohort diversity and health disparities, participant engagement, and privacy and security. We review All of Us Research Program plans to address these issues and then identify additional ELSI within each domain that warrant ongoing investigation as the All of Us Research Program develops. We conclude that PMI's All of Us Research Program represents a significant opportunity and obligation to identify, analyze, and respond to ELSI, and we call on the PMI to initiate a research program capable of taking on these challenges.Genet Med advance online publication 01 December 2016.",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2017,"Ethics, Research; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Morals; National Institutes of Health (U.S.); Precision Medicine; Privacy; Research; United States",False,5

All of Us,28770362,How will the 'cancer moonshot' impact health disparities?,"In 1971, President Nixon signed into law the National Cancer Act (NCA), colloquially known as the ""War on Cancer"", which pushed cancer onto the national agenda and is credited for many subsequent increases in the knowledge of the molecular, cellular, and genetic causes and effects of cancer. But even though cancer mortality has declined overall in intervening years after the NCA, cancer health disparities persist in the form of higher cancer incidence and mortality rates among certain cancer types and certain populations. Breast and cervical cancers disproportionately affect African American, Hispanic, and American Indian Women. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death for Latinos (with men and women combined). Forty-five years after the NCA, how will the next enormous cancer initiatives-President Barack Obama's Cancer Moonshot and the All of Us Research Program (formerly the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program)-impact cancer health disparities? The emergence of precision medicine and the sharing of information across sectors are at the heart of these large national initiatives and hold vast potential to address complex health disparities that remain in incidence reporting, incidence, treatment, prognoses, and mortality among certain cancer types and racial/ethnic minorities, including African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos, compared to Whites. But clinical research efforts and data collection have historically lacked diverse representation for various reasons, posing a large risk to these national initiatives in their ability to develop diverse cohorts that adequately represent racial/ethnic minorities. Efforts to reduce disparities and increase diversity in study cohorts have emerged, from patient navigation, to use of mobile technology to collect data, to national consortiums dedicated to including diverse groups, to university training on health disparities. These efforts point to the need for the Cancer Moonshot and precision medicine leaders to develop a multifaceted approach to address disparities in health and healthcare to promote a diverse healthcare workforce, patient-centered care, maintenance of a database of information regarding the state of health disparities, and the institution of measurable goals for improving care across all ethnic groups. If these elements are included, it is possible that the Cancer Moonshot and precision medicine will benefit the entire population of our country.",Cancer causes & control : CCC,2017,Ethnicity; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Minority Groups; Neoplasms; Precision Medicine,False,5
All of Us,30178250,"Diet, Microbiome, and Epigenetics in the Era of Precision Medicine.","Precision medicine is a revolutionary approach to disease prevention and treatment that takes into account individual differences in lifestyle, environment, and biology. The US National Institutes of Health has recently launched The All of Us Research Program (2016) to extend precision medicine to all diseases by building a national research cohort of one million or more US participants. This review is limited to how the human microbiome factors into precision medicine from the applied aspect of preventing and managing cancer. The Precision Medicine Initiative was established in an effort to address particular characteristics of each person with the aim to increase the effectiveness of medical interventions in terms of prevention and treatment of multiple diseases including cancer. Many factors contribute to the response to an intervention. The microbiome and microbially produced metabolites are capable of epigenetic modulation of gene activity, and can influence the response through these mechanisms. The fact that diet has an impact on microbiome implies that it will also affect the epigenetic mechanisms involving microbiota. In this chapter, we review some major epigenetic mechanisms, notably DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling and histone modification, and noncoding RNA, implicated in cancer prevention and treatment. Several examples of how microbially produced metabolites from food influence cancer risk and treatment response through epigenetic mechanisms will be discussed. Some challenges include the limited understanding of how diet shapes the microbiome and how to best evaluate those changes since both, diet and the microbiota, exhibit daily and seasonal variations. Ongoing research seeks to understand the relationship between the human microbiome and multiple diseases including cancer.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2018,"Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Diet; Disease Susceptibility; Energy Metabolism; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene-Environment Interaction; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Microbiota; Neoplasms; Precision Medicine",False,5

Recruitment from among blood bank donors, which may better reflect the demographic makeup of local communities, is one proposed strategy. We evaluated this strategy by analyzing the results of a survey of San Diego Blood Bank donors conducted in November 2015. Whites were more likely than nonwhites to respond to the survey (7.1 percent versus 3.9 percent). However, race was not a significant predictor of interest in participating in precision medicine research. Using census data linked to donors' ZIP codes, we also found that people who indicated interest in research participation were more likely to come from regions with higher educational attainment. Although blood banks represent a viable recruitment strategy for AoURP, our findings indicate that bias toward inclusion of whites and more highly educated people persists.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2018,"Adult; Bias; Blood Banks; Blood Donors; California; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Selection; Precision Medicine; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomic Factors; Translational Research, Biomedical",False,2
All of Us,29385589,The research participant perspective related to the conduct of genomic cohort studies: A systematic review of the quantitative literature.,"Observational genome-wide association studies require large sample sizes. Evaluating the interplay between genomic, environmental, and lifestyle factors can require even larger sample sizes. The All of Us Research Program will recruit 1 million participants to facilitate research on genomic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Integrating participant preferences into the research process is a new paradigm and a necessary component of the All of Us Research Program. The purpose of the study is to summarize quantitative studies of participant preferences related to participation in observational genomic research studies, starting with consent through return of results. Integrating this information into the conduct of genomic studies may benefit participants, and improve participant satisfaction, recruitment, and retention. We conducted a systematic review of the literature regarding participant views related to reconsent and broad consent, use of de-identified data, contribution of data to a biorepository, risk of identification, return of individual genetic results, and motivation for participation in genomic studies. Twenty-three articles met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study results found that most participants support broad consent; however, significant differences related to reconsent preferences have been shown by gender and age. Most participants support the return of individual genomic results and do not feel it is necessary to maintain a link to their de-identified data. Reasons given for joining research studies varied by population source. These findings, in addition to the knowledge that participants are more accepting of broad informed consent methods when the rationale is explained, can assist in developing guidelines for future observational genomic research.",Translational behavioral medicine,2018,Genetic Research; Humans; Informed Consent; Observational Studies as Topic; Patient Participation,False,5
All of Us,29429062,Towards precision medicine; a new biomedical cosmology.,"Precision Medicine has become a common label for data-intensive and patient-driven biomedical research. Its intended future is reflected in endeavours such as the Precision Medicine Initiative in the USA. This article addresses the question whether it is possible to discern a new 'medical cosmology' in Precision Medicine, a concept that was developed by Nicholas Jewson to describe comprehensive transformations involving various dimensions of biomedical knowledge and practice, such as vocabularies, the roles of patients and physicians and the conceptualisation of disease. Subsequently, I will elaborate my assessment of the features of Precision Medicine with the help of Michel Foucault, by exploring how precision medicine involves a transformation along three axes: the axis of biomedical knowledge, of biomedical power and of the patient as a self. Patients are encouraged to become the managers of their own health status, while the medical domain is reframed as a data-sharing community, characterised by changing power relationships between providers and patients, producers and consumers. While the emerging Precision Medicine cosmology may surpass existing knowledge frameworks; it obscures previous traditions and reduces research-subjects to mere data. This in turn, means that the individual is both subjected to the neoliberal demand to share personal information, and at the same time has acquired the positive 'right' to become a member of the data-sharing community. The subject has to constantly negotiate the meaning of his or her data, which can either enable self-expression, or function as a commanding Superego.","Medicine, health care, and philosophy",2018,"Big Data; Biomarkers; Biomedical Research; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Healthy Lifestyle; Humans; Information Dissemination; Patient Participation; Pharmacogenomic Testing; Precision Medicine; Risk Factors; Systems Biology; Telemedicine",False,5

All of Us,30325292,Working Together to Address Women's Health in Research and Drug Development: Summary of the 2017 Women's Health Congress Preconference Symposium.,"Historically, women have been underrepresented in clinical research, requiring physicians to extrapolate medical recommendations for women from clinical research done in cohorts consisting predominantly of male participants. While government-funded clinical research has achieved gender parity in phase-3 clinical trials across many biomedical disciplines, improvements are still needed in several facets of women's health research, such as the inclusion of women in early-phase clinical trials, the inclusion of pregnant women and women with physical and intellectual disabilities, the consideration of sex as a biological variable in preclinical research, and the analysis and reporting of sex and gender differences across the full biomedical research continuum. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research on Women's Health and the Office of Women's Health of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cosponsored a preconference symposium at the 25th Annual Women's Health Congress, held in Arlington, VA in April, 2017, to highlight gains made and remaining needs regarding the representation of women in clinical research, to introduce innovative procedures and technologies, and to outline revised policy for future studies. Six speakers presented information on a range of subjects related to the representation of women in clinical research and federal initiatives to advance precision medicine. Topics included the following: the return on investment from the NIH-funded Women's Health Initiative; progress in including women in clinical trials for FDA-approved drugs and products; the importance of clinical trials in pregnant women; FDA initiatives to report drug safety during pregnancy; the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program; and efforts to enhance FDA transparency and communications, including the introduction of Drug Trials Snapshots.

All of Us,29512070,Blood-Based Biomarker Screening with Agnostic Biological Definitions for an Accurate Diagnosis Within the Dimensional Spectrum of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"The discovery, development, and validation of novel candidate biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are increasingly gaining momentum. As a result, evolving diagnostic research criteria of NDs are beginning to integrate biofluid and neuroimaging indicators of pathophysiological mechanisms. More than 10% of people aged over 65 suffer from NDs. There is an urgent need for a refined two-stage diagnostic model to first initiate an early, sensitive, and noninvasive process in primary care settings. Individuals that meet detection criteria will then be channeled to more specific, costly (positron-emission tomography), and invasive (cerebrospinal fluid) assessment methods for confirmatory biological characterization and diagnosis.A reliable and sensitive blood test for AD and other NDs is not yet established; however, it would provide the golden screening gate for an efficient primary care management. A limitation to the development of a large-scale blood-screening biomarker-based test is the traditional application of clinically descriptive criteria for the categorization of single late-stage ND constructs. These are genetically and biologically heterogeneous, reflected in multiple pathophysiological mechanisms and subsequent pathologies throughout a dimensional continuum. Evidence suggests that a shared, ""open-source"" integrated multilevel categorization of NDs that clusters individuals based on descriptive clinical phenotypes and pathophysiological biomarker signatures will provide the next incremental step toward an improved diagnostic process of NDs. This intermediate objective toward unbiased biomarker-guided early detection of individuals at risk for NDs is currently carried out by the international pilot Alzheimer Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program (APMI-CP).","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2018,Biomarkers; Early Diagnosis; Humans; Mass Screening; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Precision Medicine,False,5

All of Us,31219738,Emerging Concepts in Precision Medicine and Cardiovascular Diseases in Racial and Ethnic Minority Populations.,"Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality and a major contributor to preventable deaths worldwide. The dominant modifiable risk factors and the social and environmental determinants that increase cardiovascular risk are known, and collectively, are as important in racial and ethnic minority populations as they are in majority populations. Their prevention and treatment remain the foundation for cardiovascular health promotion and disease prevention. Genetic and epigenetic factors are increasingly recognized as important contributors to cardiovascular risk and provide an opportunity for advancing precision cardiovascular medicine. In this review, we explore emerging concepts at the interface of precision medicine and cardiovascular disease in racial and ethnic minority populations. Important among these are the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in genomics studies and biorepositories; the resulting misclassification of benign variants as pathogenic in minorities; and the importance of ensuring ancestry-matched controls in variant interpretation. We address the relevance of epigenetics, pharmacogenomics, genetic testing and counseling, and their social and cultural implications. We also examine the potential impact of precision medicine on racial and ethnic disparities. The National Institutes of Health's All of Us Research Program and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine Initiative are presented as examples of research programs at the forefront of precision medicine and diversity to explore research implications in minorities. We conclude with an overview of implementation research challenges in precision medicine and the ethical implications in minority populations. Successful implementation of precision medicine in cardiovascular disease in minority populations will benefit from strategies that directly address diversity and inclusion in genomics research and go beyond race and ethnicity to explore ancestry-matched controls, as well as geographic, cultural, social, and environmental determinants of health.",Circulation research,2019,Cardiovascular Diseases; Ethnicity; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Minority Groups; Precision Medicine,False,5

Data interoperability is paramount to the program's success. AOU is standardizing its EHR data around the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model. OMOP is one of several standard data models presently used in national-scale initiatives. Each model is unique enough to make interoperability difficult. The i2b2 data warehousing and analytics platform is used at over 200 sites worldwide, which uses a flexible ontology-driven approach for data storage. We previously demonstrated this ontology system can drive data reconfiguration, to transform data into new formats without site-specific programming. We previously implemented this on our 12-site Accessible Research Commons for Health (ARCH) network to transform i2b2 into the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network model. Here, we leverage our investment in i2b2 high-performance transformations to support the AOU OMOP data pipeline. Because the ARCH ontology has gained widespread national interest (through the Accrual to Clinical Trials network, other PCORnet networks, and the Nebraska Lexicon), we leveraged sites' existing investments into this standard ontology. We developed an i2b2-to-OMOP transformation, driven by the ARCH-OMOP ontology and the OMOP concept mapping dictionary. We demonstrated and validated our approach in the AOU New England HPO (NEHPO). First, we transformed into OMOP a fake patient dataset in i2b2 and verified through AOU tools that the data was structurally compliant with OMOP. We then transformed a subset of data in the Partners Healthcare data warehouse into OMOP. We developed a checklist of assessments to ensure the transformed data had self-integrity (e.g., the distributions have an expected shape and required fields are populated), using OMOP's visual Achilles data quality tool. This i2b2-to-OMOP transformation is being used to send NEHPO production data to AOU.

All of Us,31877158,What Twitter teaches us about patient-provider communication on pain.,"The objective of this study was to understand how pain patients and health care providers (HCPs) are engaging on Twitter and what insights this engagement might provide. By identifying how information is spread by and between these audiences, organizations such as patient advocacy groups may be better poised to develop and share materials that facilitate online communication between HCPs and pain patients, with an end goal of improving a shared decision-making process around pain management. We analyzed the Twitter audiences most engaged on pain topics by conducting a Social Network Analysis (SNA) of a large network of connected users on Twitter. The analysis segmented users based on the sources they cited and measured their influence based on who follows them. As a point of comparison, we also conducted an SNA of Twitter audiences most engaged on oncology topics. Oncology was chosen as a comparison due to what was perceived to be a highly developed online network of both patients and physicians. The populations included in this research included 12,086 accounts that were highly engaged on pain-related topics, and 12,617 accounts that were highly engaged on oncology-related topics. Network statistics were generated for variables including: word use, sources cited, retweets, and mentions. We also statistically analyzed the Twitter follow relationships among select HCPs and patient groups within each SNA. The creation of separate pain and oncology SNAs allowed the team to compare relationships and engagement related to these topics. We found that on Twitter, pain patients and providers appear to interact less than oncology patients and providers. Pain patients do not appear to follow medical professionals or share medical or health-related information on Twitter to the same extent as oncology patients. In addition, we found that pain patients do not communicate on Twitter in the same language as HCPs. Our results are important because they underscore that challenges in communication are not just problematic in face-to-face interactions, but also in digital social network (Twitter) interactions, serving as an additional roadblock to what can be shared decision-making opportunities around pain management. Contributing to this roadblock is access to quality information and a potential need for an online, evidence-based resource hub that could benefit the pain patient community in the same way that cancer.gov serves as a source of aggregated materials for oncology patients and HCPs. This study is an illustration of how social media networks like Twitter can be used to better understand the relationships, language gaps, and shared resources between pain patients and providers and offers a template for using digital social network (Twitter) interactions to research other difficult-to-treat or rare disease states.",PloS one,2019,Health Information Systems; Humans; Online Social Networking; Pain; Physician-Patient Relations; Social Media,False,5

We measured serum antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA) by immunofluorescence on Hep-2 cells in 668 male farmers in the study of Biomarkers of Exposure and Effect in Agriculture (BEEA; 2010-2013), an Agricultural Health Study (AHS) subcohort. We examined ANA in relation to lifetime use of 46 pesticides first reported at AHS enrollment (1993-1997) and updated at intervals through BEEA enrollment. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated after adjusting for age, state, education, season of blood draw, current pesticide use, and correlated pesticides. Having ANA antibodies (3 or 4+ intensity at a 1:80 dilution, 21% of study participants) was associated with a reported history of seeking medical care due to exposure to pesticides (OR 2.15; 95%CI 1.17, 3.95), use of the fumigant methyl bromide (OR 3.16; 95%CI 1.05, 9.5), and use of petroleum oil/distillates (OR 1.50; 95%CI 1.00, 2.25). Using a higher threshold (3 or 4+ at a 1:160 dilution, 9%) ANA positivity was associated with the carbamate insecticide aldicarb (OR 4.82; 95%CI 1.33, 17.5) and greater combined use of four cyclodiene organochlorine insecticides (top tertile of intensity-weighted lifetime days vs. no use; OR ",Frontiers in immunology,2019,"Aged; Agriculture; Antibodies, Antinuclear; Autoimmunity; Farmers; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Exposure; Pesticides; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires",False,9

Sickle cell disease (SCD), the most commonly inherited blood disorder, is a frontline candidate for the clinical applications of this tool. However, there is limited knowledge of patient community values and concerns regarding this new technology. This study aims to investigate the perspectives of three key decision-makers (patients, parents, and physicians) toward participation in future CRISPR-mediated somatic genome editing clinical trials. We utilized a mixed-methods approach, involving an educational video tool, two-part survey, and 15 moderated, audio-recorded focus groups, which were conducted in seven U.S. cities. Study participants expressed hope that genome editing technology would rechart the course for SCD, but concerns related to involvement burden, uncertainty of clinical outcomes, and equity in access were identified. Major themes emerged from the focus groups: facilitators of, and barriers to, participation in future somatic genome editing clinical trials; information pertinent to the decision-making process; persons from whom participants would seek counsel before making a decision; and recommendations for the research community on meaningful engagement as clinical trials are designed and approved.

However, little systematic analysis is available about their impact on infant health outcomes, such as reducing low birth weight or malnutrition among children under the age of five. The objective of this study is to determine if an age- and stage-based mobile phone voice messaging initiative for women, during pregnancy and up to 1 year after delivery, can reduce low birth weight and child malnutrition and improve women's infant care knowledge and practices. Methods We conducted a pseudo-randomized controlled trial among pregnant women from urban slums and low-income areas in Mumbai, India. Pregnant women, 18 years and older, speaking Hindi or Marathi were enrolled and assigned to receive mMitra messages (intervention group N = 1516) or not (Control group N = 500). Women in the intervention group received mMitra voice messages two times per week throughout their pregnancy and until their infant turned 1 year of age. Infant's birth weight, anthropometric data at 1 year of age, and status of immunization were obtained from Maternal Child Health (MCH) cards to assess impact on primary infant health outcomes. Women's infant health care practices and knowledge were assessed through interviews administered immediately after women enrolled in the study (Time 1), after they delivered their babies (Time 2), and after their babies turned 1 year old (Time 3). 15 infant care practices self-reported by women (Time 3) and knowledge on ten infant care topics (Time 2) were also compared between intervention and control arms. Results We observed a trend for increased odds of a baby being born at or above the ideal birth weight of 2.5 kg in the intervention group compared to controls (odds ratio (OR) 1.334, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.983-1.839, p = 0.064). The intervention group performed significantly better on two infant care practice indicators: giving the infant supplementary feeding at 6 months of age (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.08-1.82, p = 0.009) and fully immunizing the infant as prescribed under the Government of India's child immunization program (OR 1.531, 95% CI 1.141-2.055, p = 0.005). Women in the intervention group had increased odds of knowing that the baby should be given solid food by 6 months (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.371-2.605, p < 0.01), that the baby needs to be given vaccines (OR 1.567, 95% CI 1.047-2.345, p = 0.028), and that the ideal birth weight is > 2.5 kg (OR 2.279, 95% CI 1.617-3.213, p < 0.01). Conclusions for Practice This study provides robust evidence that tailored mobile voice messages can significantly improve infant care practices and maternal knowledge that can positively impact infant child health. Furthermore, this is the first prospective study of a voice-based mHealth intervention to demonstrate a positive impact on infant birth weight, a health outcome of public health importance in many LMICs.",Maternal and child health journal,2019,"Adult; Cell Phone; Child; Child Nutrition Disorders; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; India; Infant; Infant Care; Infant Health; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Malnutrition; Mothers; Poverty Areas; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Telemedicine; Voice; Young Adult",False,0

It is set to become one of the largest research efforts in U.S. history, aiming to build a national resource of data from at least one million participants. All of Us aims to address the need for more diversity in research and set the stage for that diversity to be leveraged in precision medicine research to come. This paper describes how the program assessed demographic characteristics of participants who have enrolled in other U.S. biomedical research cohorts to better understand which groups are traditionally represented or underrepresented in biomedical research. We 1) reviewed the enrollment characteristics of national cohort studies like All of Us, and 2) surveyed the literature, focusing on key diversity categories essential to the program's enrollment aims. Based on these efforts, All of Us emphasizes enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities, and has formally designated the following additional groups as historically underrepresented: individuals-with inadequate access to medical care; under the age of 18 or over 65; with an annual household income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level; who have a cognitive or physical disability; have less than a high school education or equivalent; are intersex; identify as a sexual or gender minority; or live in rural or non-metropolitan areas.

We evaluated enrollment methods and challenges to enrollments encountered by the UA-Banner Health Provider Organization into the AoURP. Challenges to enrollment centered around the need for high-touch engagement methods, time investment necessary for stakeholder inclusion, and the use of purely digital enrollment methods especially in populations under-represented in biomedical research. These challenges occurred at the level of the individual, provider, institutions, and community, and cumulatively impacted participant enrollment. Successful strategies for engagement and enrollment leveraged provider partners as advocates for the program.

Therefore, the concept of ""biobank 3.0"" was introduced so that biobanks could better meet the needs of stakeholders and maintain sustainable operations. Theoretically, the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) has already gone through the concepts of biobank 1.0 and 2.0. However, three challenges still need to be addressed before it can be transformed into a new generation of the TWB (namely, the TWB 3.0): (1) the difficulty of integrating other biobanks' resources, (2) the efficiency and effectiveness of the release and use of biospecimens/data, and (3) the development of income and revenue models of sustainability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a framework for the TWB 3.0 transformation based on a dual-pillar approach composed of a ""physically"" vertical integration driven by the TWB and a ""virtually"" horizontal network led by the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) of Taiwan. Using prominent biobanks such as the Biobanking and BioMolecular Resources Research Infrastructure-European Research Infrastructure Consortium (BBMRI-ERIC), the UK Biobank, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)'s All of Us Research Program as models, the TWB can strengthen its on-going TWB 2.0 operations in regional and/or international collaboration, increase the value of data collected and develop closer relationships with biobank participants and users. To these ends, the authors highlight key issues that include, but are not limited to, the harmonization of relevant ELSI standards for various biobanks' integrations; the value-added services and the efficiency of Big Data Era related research and/or precision medicine development, and financial concerns related to biobank sustainability.

As a pioneer of large-scale of return of research results, the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort now known of All of Us plans to return pharmacogenomic results and variants of clinical significance to its participants starting late 2019. To better understand the local landscape of possibilities regarding return of research results, we assessed the frequency of pathogenic variants and APOL1 renal risk variants in a small diverse cohort of chronic kidney disease patients (CKD) ascertained from a public hospital in Cleveland, Ohio genotyped on the Illumina Infinium MegaEX. Of the 23,720 ClinVar-designated variants directly assayed by the MegaEX, 8,355 (35%) had at least one alternate allele in the 130 participants genotyped. Of these, 18 ClinVar variants deemed pathogenic by multiple submitters with no conflicts in interpretation were distributed across 27 participants. The majority of these pathogenic ClinVar variants (14/18) were associated with autosomal recessive disorders. Of note were four African American carriers of TTR rs76992529 associated with amyloidogenic transthyretin amyloidosis, otherwise known as familial transthyretin amyloidosis (FTA). FTA, an autosomal dominant disorder with variable penetrance, is more common among African-descent populations compared with European-descent populations. Also common in this CKD population were APOL1 renal risk alleles G1 (rs73885319) and G2 (rs71785313) with 60% of the study population carrying at least one renal risk allele. Both pathogenic ClinVar variants and APOL1 renal risk alleles were distributed among participants who wanted actionable genetic results returned, wanted genetic results returned regardless of actionability, and wanted no results returned.

Development and evaluation of machine learning models. Electronic health record data were extracted from AoU for 1,231 adults diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma. The single-center model was applied to AoU data for external validation. AoU data were then used to train new models for predicting the need for glaucoma surgery using multivariable logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and random forests. Five-fold cross-validation was performed. Model performance was evaluated based on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, and recall. The mean (standard deviation) age of the AoU cohort was 69.1 (10.5) years, with 57.3% women and 33.5% black, significantly exceeding representation in the single-center cohort (P = .04 and P < .001, respectively). Of 1,231 participants, 286 (23.2%) needed glaucoma surgery. When applying the single-center model to AoU data, accuracy was 0.69 and AUC was only 0.49. Using AoU data to train new models resulted in superior performance: AUCs ranged from 0.80 (logistic regression) to 0.99 (random forests). Models trained with national AoU data achieved superior performance compared with using single-center data. Although AoU does not currently include ophthalmic imaging, it offers several strengths over similar big-data sources such as claims data.

We used cohort data from the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program (All of Us) Researcher Workbench to estimate population-level obesity prevalence. To estimate state-level obesity prevalence we used data from physical measurements made during All of Us enrollment visits and data from participant electronic health records (EHRs) where available. Prevalence estimates were calculated and mapped by state for 2 categories of body mass index (BMI) (kg/m Data on height and weight were available for 244,504 All of Us participants from 33 states, and corresponding EHR data were available for 88,840 of these participants. The median and IQR of BMI taken from physical measurements data was 28.4 (24.4- 33.7) and 28.5 (24.5-33.6) from EHR data, where available. Overall obesity prevalence based on physical measurements data was 41.5% (95% CI, 41.3%-41.7%); prevalence of severe obesity was 20.7% (95% CI, 20.6-20.9), with large geographic variations observed across states. Prevalence estimates from states with greater numbers of All of Us participants were more similar to national population-based estimates than states with fewer participants. All of Us participants had a high prevalence of obesity, with state-level geographic variation mirroring national trends.

All of Us,33503628,Teenagers and Precision Psychiatry: A Window of Opportunity.,"Precision medicine raises hope for translating genetic-based knowledge about psychiatric risks into mental health benefits by motivating health-related, risk-reducing behaviors. Teenagers (ages 14-17) are an important age-group to engage in preventive efforts but, their views about psychiatric genetics are understudied. An online survey with a nationally representative sample of teenagers (n = 417) was conducted. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2 handouts, 1 emphasizing the genetic underpinnings of psychiatric conditions; the other agency-oriented and focusing on gene-environment interactions. Survey questions queried their views about behavioral changes in response to psychiatric genetic risk information and expressed willingness to undertake them. Participants' decision-making characteristics (i.e., self-efficacy, empowerment, intolerance of uncertainty, and sensation-seeking) were assessed at baseline. Teenagers strongly valued the information provided and its potential usefulness for their mental health. Information about psychiatric genetics alone impacted views about the causes of mental illness. Contrary to our hypothesis, the type of handout did not impact participants' expressed willingness to make behavioral changes to reduce their risk of developing a psychiatric condition, but their sense of empowerment played a key role in their responses. Educating teenagers about gene-environment interactions may help facilitate the translational efforts of precision psychiatry. Research with teenagers across racial/ethnic groups, especially those with family histories, is needed to better understand the factors that impact teenagers' empowerment in psychiatric genomic settings and to identify measures, including the best enablers of empowerment (e.g., educators, parents), which would allow them to reap the benefits of precision psychiatry.",Public health genomics,2021,Adolescent; Adolescent Health; Decision Making; Empowerment; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Patient Education as Topic; Precision Medicine; Psychiatry; Risk Factors; Risk Reduction Behavior; Risk-Taking; Surveys and Questionnaires,False,2
All of Us,34158555,Hypertension prevalence in the All of Us Research Program among groups traditionally underrepresented in medical research.,"The All of Us Research Program was designed to enable broad-based precision medicine research in a cohort of unprecedented scale and diversity. Hypertension (HTN) is a major public health concern. The validity of HTN data and definition of hypertension cases in the All of Us (AoU) Research Program for use in rule-based algorithms is unknown. In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we compare HTN prevalence in the AoU Research Program to HTN prevalence in the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We used AoU baseline data from patient (age ≥ 18) measurements (PM), surveys, and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements. We retrospectively examined the prevalence of HTN in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR. We defined HTN as the participant having at least 2 HTN diagnosis/billing codes on separate dates in the EHR data AND at least one HTN medication. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, and ≥ 60). Among the 185,770 participants enrolled in the AoU Cohort (mean age at enrollment = 51.2 years) available in a Researcher Workbench as of October 2019, EHR data was available for at least one SNOMED code from 112,805 participants, medications for 104,230 participants, and 103,490 participants had both medication and SNOMED data. The total number of persons with SNOMED codes on at least two distinct dates and at least one antihypertensive medication was 33,310 for a crude prevalence of HTN of 32.2%. AoU age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% using 3 groups compared to 29.6% in NHANES.

All of Us,34644234,Nature vs. Nurture in Precision Education: Insights of Parents and the Public.,"The philosophical debate about the roles of nature versus nurture in human flourishing is not new. But the rise of precision education-a growing field of research that encourages the use of genetic data to inform educational trajectory and interventions to better meet student needs-has renewed historical and ethical concerns. A major worry is that ""genetic hype"" may skew public perceptions toward a deterministic perception of the child's educational trajectory, regardless of the child's capacities, and underestimation of environmental factors affecting educational outcomes. We tested this hypothesis with parents and adults from the general public in the US. A newly developed computerized implicit association test (IAT) to assess automatic associations between genetics or environments and student behaviors that are associated with educational achievement was administered to samples of parents of children below 21 years old (n = 450) and adults from the general public (n = 419). The samples were representative of the adult US population and adjusted to oversample Black/African American participants. An overall D score for participants' IATs (range: [-2, 2]) was calculated on the basis of the speed of participants' responses. The mean IAT score for both samples indicated stronger association between the quality of being a good student and environment rather than genetics (parents: mean=-0.146, t = -6.56, p < 0.001; general public: mean = -0.249, t = -9.45, p < 0.0001). Younger participants from the general public showed a stronger association between genetics and educational success than middle-aged participants (β = -0.301, p = 0.006). The views of parents and the general public on behavioral genetics and education are complex but call for investment in creating educational environments that are supportive of student success. Future research is needed to understand differences across age groups and to explore views of other stakeholders involved in determining children's educational trajectories about the roles of nature versus nurture in precision education.",AJOB empirical bioethics,2022,Achievement; Adult; Child; Educational Status; Humans; Middle Aged; Parents; Young Adult,False,0

Our objective was to evaluate the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in broadly defined underrepresented groups. Methods and Results We evaluated the latest data release of All of Us. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis combining survey and electronic health record data to estimate the prevalence of CVD upon enrollment in underrepresented groups defined by race, ethnicity, age (>75 years), disability (not able to carry out everyday physical activities), sexual orientation and gender identity lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA+), income (annual household income <$35 000 US dollars) and education (less than a high school degree). We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and product terms to test for interaction. The latest All of Us data release includes 315 297 participants. Of these, 230 577 (73%) had information on CVD and 17 958 had CVD (overall prevalence, 7.8%; 95% CI, 7.7-7.9). Multivariate analyses adjusted by hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, body mass index, and smoking indicated that, compared with White participants, Black participants had a higher adjusted odds of CVD (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.16-1.27). Higher adjusted odds of CVD were also observed in underrepresented groups defined by other factors, including age >75 years (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.81-1.99), disability (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.53-1.68), and income <$35 000 US dollars (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.17-1.27). Sex significantly modified the odds of CVD in several of the evaluated groups. Conclusions Among participants enrolled in All of Us, underrepresented groups defined based on race, ethnicity and other factors have a disproportionately high burden of CVD.

We sought to replicate these differences and evaluate newly emerging data from the All of Us Research Program (AoU). We compared body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio from the baseline physical examination, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) from the electronic health record in up to 88,195 Non-Hispanic White (NHW), 40,770 Non-Hispanic Black (NHB), 35,640 Hispanic, and 5,648 Asian participants. We compared AoU sociodemographic variable distribution to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data and applied the pseudo-weighting method for adjusting selection biases of AoU recruitment. Our findings replicate previous observations with respect to gender differences in BMI. In particular, we replicate the large gender disparity in obesity rates among NHB participants, in which obesity and mean BMI are much higher in NHB women than NHB men (33.34 kg/m2 versus 28.40 kg/m2 respectively; p<2.22x10-308). The overall age-adjusted obesity prevalence in AoU participants is similar overall but lower than the prevalence found in NHANES for NHW participants. ALT was higher in men than women, and lower among NHB participants compared to other racial/ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings.

This Demonstration Project aims to evaluate availability of family health history information within the publicly available data from All of Us and to characterize the data from both sources. Surveys were completed by participants on an electronic portal. EHR data was mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership data model. We used descriptive statistics to perform exploratory analysis of the data, including evaluating a list of medically actionable genetic disorders. We performed a subanalysis on participants who had both survey and EHR data. There were 54 872 participants with family history data. Of those, 26% had EHR data only, 63% had survey only, and 10.5% had data from both sources. There were 35 217 participants with reported family history of a medically actionable genetic disorder (9% from EHR only, 89% from surveys, and 2% from both). In the subanalysis, we found inconsistencies between the surveys and EHRs. More details came from surveys. When both mentioned a similar disease, the source of truth was unclear.

The NIH Office of Disease Prevention updated its prevention research taxonomy in 2019‒2020 and applied it to a sample of 14,523 new extramural projects awarded in 2012-2019. All projects were coded manually for rationale, exposures, outcomes, population focus, study design, and type of prevention research. All results are based on that manual coding. Taxonomy updates resulted in a slight increase, from an average of 16.7% to 17.6%, in the proportion of prevention research awards for 2012‒2017; there was a further increase to 20.7% in 2019. Most of the leading risk factors for death and disability in the U.S. were observed as an exposure or outcome in <5% of prevention research projects in 2019 (e.g., diet, 3.7%; tobacco, 3.9%; blood pressure, 2.8%; obesity, 4.4%). Analysis of existing data became more common (from 36% to 46.5%), whereas randomized interventions became less common (from 20.5% to 12.3%).

Research participation from Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in precision health research is, however, limited; this includes Vietnamese Americans, especially those with limited English proficiency. PMI engagement efforts with underserved communities, including members of minority populations or individuals who have experienced health disparities such as Vietnamese Americans with limited English proficiency, may help to enrich the diversity of the PMI. The aim of this study is to examine the attitudes towards and perceptions of precision health, motivations and barriers to participation in precision health research, and acceptability of SMS text messaging as a recruitment and intervention strategy among underserved Vietnamese Americans. A community sample of 37 Vietnamese Americans completed a survey and participated in one of 3 focus groups classified by age (18-30, 31-59, and ≥60 years) on topics related to precision health, participation in precision health research, texting or social media use experience, and insights on how to use text messages for recruitment and intervention. Participants were recruited via community organizations that serve Vietnamese Americans, flyers, word of mouth, and Vietnamese language radio announcements. Most participants had little knowledge of precision health initially. After brief education, they had positive attitudes toward precision health, although the motivation to participate in precision health research varied by age and prior experience of research participation. The main motivators to participate included the desire for more knowledge and more representation of Vietnamese Americans in research. Participants were open to receiving text messages as part of their research participation and provided specific suggestions on the design and delivery of such messages (eg, simple, in both English and Vietnamese). Examples of barriers included misinterpretation of messages, cost (to send text messages), and preferences for different texting platforms across age groups. This study represents one of the first formative research studies to recruit underserved Vietnamese Americans to precision health research. It is critical to understand target communities' motivations and barriers to participation in research. Delivering culturally appropriate text messages via age-appropriate texting and social media platforms may be an effective recruitment and intervention strategy.

All of Us,34920126,Membership inference attacks against synthetic health data.,"Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising method to protect patient privacy while sharing individual-level health data. Intuitively, sharing synthetic data should reduce disclosure risks because no explicit linkage is retained between the synthetic records and the real data upon which it is based. However, the risks associated with synthetic data are still evolving, and what seems protected today may not be tomorrow. In this paper, we show that membership inference attacks, whereby an adversary infers if the data from certain target individuals (known to the adversary a priori) were relied upon by the synthetic data generation process, can be substantially enhanced through state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, which calls into question the protective nature of existing synthetic data generators. Specifically, we formulate the membership inference problem from the perspective of the data holder, who aims to perform a disclosure risk assessment prior to sharing any health data. To support such an assessment, we introduce a framework for effective membership inference against synthetic health data without specific assumptions about the generative model or a well-defined data structure, leveraging the principles of contrastive representation learning. To illustrate the potential for such an attack, we conducted experiments against synthesis approaches using two datasets derived from several health data resources (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the All of Us Research Program) to determine the upper bound of risk brought by an adversary who invokes an optimal strategy. The results indicate that partially synthetic data are vulnerable to membership inference at a very high rate. By contrast, fully synthetic data are only marginally susceptible and, in most cases, could be deemed sufficiently protected from membership inference.",Journal of biomedical informatics,2022,Confidentiality; Disclosure; Genomics; Humans; Machine Learning; Population Health,False,7

In 2017 and 2018, the authors designed, facilitated, and evaluated a mixed stakeholder training, Communicating to Engage, at 2 urban academic medical centers involved in the All of Us research program, Boston Medical Center and Mass General Brigham. The goal was to bring together researchers and community members to develop communication skills through improvisational theater-based co-learning. The curriculum was inspired by several evidence-based learning frameworks including community-based participatory research principles and improvisational theater techniques. A self-administered survey completed before and after the training session measured participants' communication skills using the Self-Perceived Communication Competence Scale (SPCCS) and comfort with specific communication styles as outlined in the program's training objectives. Paired t tests were used to measure changes in scaled responses among combined participants and separately among self-identified community members and researchers. Sixty-nine total participants across 6 workshops completed training evaluations. Overall, pre-post survey analysis demonstrated significant mean score improvement for both the SPCCS and comfort with specific communication styles. In stratified analysis, both community members (n = 26) and researchers (n = 38) reported significant improvement in scores related to comfort with specific communication styles. Only researchers, but not community members, had significant improvement in SPCCS scores. The Communicating to Engage program brought community and researcher stakeholders together and demonstrated improvement in self-perceived communication styles, yet researcher participants benefited more than community participants.

We used the beta release of the All of Us Researcher Workbench with clinical and survey data from a population of 225 000 subjects. We identified 3 cohorts of individuals at high risk to develop lung cancer based on (1) the 2013 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force criteria, (2) the long-term quitters of cigarette smoking criteria, and (3) the younger age of onset criteria. We applied the logistic regression analysis to identify the significant associations between individuals' phenotypes and their risk categories. We validated our findings against a lung cancer cohort from the same population and conducted an expert review to understand whether these associations are known or potentially novel. We found a total of 214 statistically significant associations (P < .05 with a Bonferroni correction and odds ratio > 1.5) enriched in the high-risk individuals from 3 cohorts, and 15 enriched in the low-risk individuals. Forty significant associations enriched in the high-risk individuals and 13 enriched in the low-risk individuals were validated in the cancer cohort.

All of Us,34856180,"Global estimates of viral suppression in children and adolescents and adults on antiretroviral therapy adjusted for missing viral load measurements: a multiregional, retrospective cohort study in 31 countries.","As countries move towards the UNAIDS's 95-95-95 targets and with strong evidence that undetectable equals untransmittable, it is increasingly important to assess whether those with HIV who are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) achieve viral suppression. We estimated the proportions of children and adolescents and adults with viral suppression at 1, 2, and 3 years after initiating ART. In this retrospective cohort study, seven regional cohorts from the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) consortium contributed data from individuals initiating ART between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2019, at 148 sites in 31 countries with annual viral load monitoring. Only people with HIV who started ART after the time a site started routine viral load monitoring were included. Data up to March 31, 2020, were analysed. We estimated the proportions of children and adolescents (aged <18 years at ART initiation) and adults (aged ≥18 years at ART initiation) with viral suppression (viral load <1000 copies per mL) at 1, 2, and 3 years after ART initiation using an intention-to-treat approach and an adjusted approach that accounted for missing viral load measurements. 21 594 children and adolescents (11 812 [55%] female, 9782 [45%] male) from 106 sites in 22 countries and 255 662 adults (163 831 [64%] female, 91 831 [36%] male) from 143 sites in 30 countries were included. Using the intention-to-treat approach, the proportion of children and adolescents with viral suppression was 7303 (36%) of 20 478 at 1 year, 5709 (30%) of 19 135 at 2 years, and 4287 (24%) of 17 589 at 3 years after ART initiation; the proportion of adults with viral suppression was 106 541 (44%) of 240 600 at 1 year, 79 141 (36%) of 220 925 at 2 years, and 57 970 (29%) of 201 124 at 3 years after ART initiation. After adjusting for missing viral load measurements among those who transferred, were lost to follow-up, or who were in follow-up without viral load testing, the proportion of children and adolescents with viral suppression was 12 048 (64% [plausible range 43-81]) of 18 835 at 1 year, 10 796 (62% [41-77]) of 17 553 at 2 years, and 9177 (59% [38-91]) of 15 667 at 3 years after ART initiation; the proportion of adults with viral suppression was 176 964 (79% [53-80]) of 225 418 at 1 year, 145 552 (72% [48-79]) of 201 238 at 2 years, and 115 260 (65% [43-69]) of 178 458 at 3 years after ART initiation. Although adults with HIV are approaching the global target of 95% viral suppression, progress among children and adolescents is much slower.

All of Us,33964094,Insights into the skin microbiome of sickle cell disease leg ulcers.,"Leg ulcers are estimated to occur in 1%-10% of North American patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Their pathophysiology remains poorly defined, but as with other chronic wounds, it is hypothesised that the microbial milieu, or microbiome, contributes to their healing and clinical outcomes. This study utilises 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing to describe, for the first time, the microbiome of the SCD leg ulcer and its association with clinical factors. In a cross-sectional analysis of 42 ulcers, we recovered microbial profiles similar to other chronic wounds in the predominance of anaerobic bacteria and opportunistic pathogens including Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Finegoldia. Ulcers separated into two clusters: one defined by predominance of Staphylococcus and smaller surface area, and the other displaying a greater diversity of taxa and larger surface area. We also find that the relative abundance of Porphyromonas is negatively associated with haemoglobin levels, a key clinical severity indicator for SCD, and that Finegoldia relative abundance is negatively associated with CD19+ B cell count. Finally, ratios of Corynebacterium:Lactobacillus and Staphylococcus:Lactobacillus are elevated in the intact skin of individuals with a history of SCD leg ulcers, while the ratio of Lactobacillus:Bacillus is elevated in that of individuals without a history of ulcers. Investigations of the skin microbiome in relation to SCD ulcer pathophysiology can inform clinical guidelines for this poorly understood chronic wound, as well as enhance broader understanding about the role of the skin microbiome in delayed wound healing.",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,2021,"Anemia, Sickle Cell; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Leg Ulcer; Microbiota; Wound Healing",False,4
All of Us,34930020,Arrhythmia Variant Associations and Reclassifications in the eMERGE-III Sequencing Study.,"Sequencing Mendelian arrhythmia genes in individuals without an indication for arrhythmia genetic testing can identify carriers of pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants. However, the extent to which these variants are associated with clinically meaningful phenotypes before or after return of variant results is unclear. In addition, the majority of discovered variants are currently classified as variants of uncertain significance, limiting clinical actionability. The eMERGE-III study (Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Phase III) is a multicenter prospective cohort that included 21 846 participants without previous indication for cardiac genetic testing. Participants were sequenced for 109 Mendelian disease genes, including 10 linked to arrhythmia syndromes. Variant carriers were assessed with electronic health record-derived phenotypes and follow-up clinical examination. Selected variants of uncertain significance (n=50) were characterized in vitro with automated electrophysiology experiments in HEK293 cells. As previously reported, 3.0% of participants had P/LP variants in the 109 genes. Herein, we report 120 participants (0.6%) with P/LP arrhythmia variants. Compared with noncarriers, arrhythmia P/LP carriers had a significantly higher burden of arrhythmia phenotypes in their electronic health records. Fifty-four participants had variant results returned. Nineteen of these 54 participants had inherited arrhythmia syndrome diagnoses (primarily long-QT syndrome), and 12 of these 19 diagnoses were made only after variant results were returned (0.05%). After in vitro functional evaluation of 50 variants of uncertain significance, we reclassified 11 variants: 3 to likely benign and 8 to P/LP. Genome sequencing in a large population without indication for arrhythmia genetic testing identified phenotype-positive carriers of variants in congenital arrhythmia syndrome disease genes. As the genomes of large numbers of people are sequenced, the disease risk from rare variants in arrhythmia genes can be assessed by integrating genomic screening, electronic health record phenotypes, and in vitro functional studies.

Eye patients in the All of Us Research Program database with at least 15 months of follow-up and 1 BP measurement. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models predicted the risk of developing incident open-angle glaucoma (OAG). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the number of BP medication classes were entered as time-varying predictors to account for changes over time. The risk of developing incident OAG, as defined by billing diagnosis codes. Of 20 815 eligible eye patients who qualified for this study, 462 developed OAG. Low BP (MAP < 83.0 mmHg) was associated with increased risk of developing OAG (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.67). High BP (MAP > 101.3 mmHg) and the number of BP medication classes were not associated with OAG after adjustment for covariates. Other risk factors associated with OAG included being Black (HR, 3.31, 95% CI, 2.63-4.17), Hispanic or Latino (HR, 2.53, 95% CI, 1.94-3.28), Asian (HR, 2.22, 95% CI, 1.24-3.97), older in age (80+ years, HR, 20.1, 95% CI, 9.10-44.5), and diabetic (HR, 1.32, 95% CI, 1.04-1.67). Female gender was associated with decreased hazard of developing OAG (HR, 0.66, 95% CI, 0.55-0.80). No significant interaction was observed between MAP and the number of BP medications on the risk of developing OAG. We found that low BP is associated with increased risk of developing OAG in a national longitudinal EHR database.

Applying a distributional cost-effectiveness framework, we estimated the cost-effectiveness and epidemiological impact of two combination implementation approaches to identify the approach that best meets the dual objectives of improving population health and reducing racial or ethnic health disparities. We adapted a dynamic, compartmental HIV transmission model to characterise HIV micro-epidemics in six US cities: Atlanta, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and Seattle. We considered combinations of 16 evidence-based interventions to diagnose, treat, and prevent HIV transmission according to previously documented levels of scale-up. We then identified optimal combination strategies for each city, with the distribution of each intervention implemented according to existing service levels (proportional services approach) and the racial or ethnic distribution of new diagnoses (between Black, Hispanic or Latinx, and White or other ethnicity individuals; equity approach). We estimated total costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of strategies implemented from 2020 to 2030 (health-care perspective; 20-year time horizon; 3% annual discount rate). We estimated three measures of health inequality (between-group variance, index of disparity, Theil index), incidence rate ratios, and rate differences for the selected strategies under each approach. In all cities, optimal combination strategies under the equity approach generated more QALYs than those with proportional services, ranging from a 3·1% increase (95% credible interval [CrI] 1·4-5·3) in New York to more than double (101·9% [75·4-134·6]) in Atlanta. Compared with proportional services, the equity approach delivered lower costs over 20 years in all cities except Los Angeles; cost reductions ranged from $22·9 million (95% CrI 5·3-55·7 million) in Seattle to $579·8 million (255·4-940·5 million) in Atlanta. The equity approach also reduced incidence disparities and health inequality measures in all cities except Los Angeles. Equity-focused HIV combination implementation strategies that reduce disparities for Black and Hispanic or Latinx individuals can significantly improve population health, reduce costs, and drive progress towards Ending the HIV Epidemic goals in the USA.

This novel method detects potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) by leveraging data from the electronic health record (EHR) allergy list. To identify potential DDIs, DDIWAS scans for drug pairs that are frequently documented together on the allergy list. Using deidentified medical records, we tested 616 drugs for potential DDIs with simvastatin (a common lipid-lowering drug) and amlodipine (a common blood-pressure lowering drug). We evaluated the performance to rediscover known DDIs using existing knowledge bases and domain expert review. To validate potential novel DDIs, we manually reviewed patient charts and searched the literature. DDIWAS replicated 34 known DDIs. The positive predictive value to detect known DDIs was 0.85 and 0.86 for simvastatin and amlodipine, respectively. DDIWAS also discovered potential novel interactions between simvastatin-hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine-omeprazole, and amlodipine-valacyclovir. A software package to conduct DDIWAS is publicly available. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate the value of incorporating information mined from existing allergy lists to detect DDIs in a real-world clinical setting.

To construct a weighted HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) gene genetic risk score (GRS) using variants in the HMGCR gene affecting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as an instrumental variable for mendelian randomization analyses to test associations with candidate noncardiovascular phenotypes previously associated with statin use in observational studies. This cohort study included 53 385 unrelated adults of European ancestry with genome-wide genotypes available from BioVU (a practice-based biobank, used for discovery) and 30 444 unrelated adults with European ancestry available in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE; a research consortium that conducts genetic research using electronic medical records, used for replication). The study was conducted from February 6, 2015, through April 31, 2019; data analysis was performed from August 26, 2019, through December 22, 2020. An HMGCR GRS was calculated. The association between the HMGCR GRS and the presence or absence of 22 noncardiovascular phenotypes previously associated with statin use in clinical studies. Of the 53 385 individuals in BioVU, 29 958 (56.1%) were women; mean (SD) age was 59.9 (15.6) years. The finding between the HMGCR GRS and the noncardiovascular phenotypes of interest in this cohort was significant only for type 2 diabetes. An HMGCR GRS equivalent to a 10-mg/dL decrease in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04-1.15; P = 5.58 × 10-4). The HMGCR GRS was not associated with other phenotypes; the closest were increased risk of Parkinson disease (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.07-1.58; P = .007) and kidney failure (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05-1.34; P = .008).

We performed hierarchical clustering to generate symptom phenotypes of fatigue, emotional distress, and pain and used multinomial regression to determine if demographic, healthcare access and utilization, and health-related variables predict symptom phenotype. Four phenotypes, one asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and three highly symptomatic (characterized by severe symptoms, severe pain, and severe emotional distress), were identified. The percentage of participants belonging to the severe symptoms phenotype increased with the number of chronic conditions. Most notably, foregoing or delaying medical care and rating mental health as poor or fair increased the odds of belonging to a highly symptomatic phenotype. We found meaningful relationships between demographic, healthcare access and utilization, and health-related factors and symptom phenotypes. With the increasing trends of American adults with one or more chronic conditions and a demand to individualize care in the precision health era, it is critical to understand the factors that lead to unrelieved symptoms.",Journal of pain and symptom management,2022,"Humans; United States; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Retrospective Studies; Population Health; Chronic Disease; Pain",False,4

We administered an online disability-accessible survey to explore perceptions of PMR among, inter alia, deaf/HoH individuals. Questions included willingness to participate, interest in results, and barriers and facilitators to participation. Analyses describe results for participants who self-identified their primary condition as being deaf/HoH and compared results for key demographic characteristics. A total of 267 deaf/HoH participants completed the survey. Interest in PMR was high, although many reported inaccessible facilities and information about medical research; 51% reported that communication with health professionals is a barrier. Concerns about harm, lack of access to benefits, misinformed allocation decisions, and limited disability-relevant knowledge among researchers and health care providers were significant. Differences across racial, ethnic, and sex groups were observed and are discussed. Strategies to remove barriers to participation of deaf/HoH individuals in PMR are suggested.

Personal wearables, sensors, and mobile technologies are increasingly being used to identify health risks and assist in diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of health and disease. Genomics is a vanguard of digital healthcare as we witness a convergence of the fields of genomic and digital medicine. Spurred by the acute need to increase health literacy, empower patients' preference-sensitive decisions, or integrate vast amounts of complex genomic data into the clinical workflow, there has been an emergence of digital support tools in genomics-enabled care. We present three use cases that demonstrate the application of these converging technologies: digital genomics decision support tools, conversational chatbots to scale the genetic counseling process, and the digital delivery of comprehensive genetic services. These digital solutions are important to facilitate patient-centered care delivery, improve patient outcomes, and increase healthcare efficiencies in genomic medicine. Yet the development of these innovative digital genomic technologies also reveals strategic challenges that need to be addressed before genomic digital health can be broadly adopted. Alongside key evidentiary gaps in clinical and cost-effectiveness, there is a paucity of clinical guidelines, policy, and regulatory frameworks that incorporate digital health.

We examined these therapies and glycemic control in US adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and sociodemographic factors. In the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative All of Us Research Program, we categorized DM as (1) moderate risk, (2) high risk, and (3) with ASCVD. We examined proportions on DM therapies, including SGLT2-i or GLP-1 RA, and at glycemic control by sociodemographic factors and CVD risk groups. Our 81,332 adults aged ≥ 18 years with DM across 340 US sites included 22.3% non-Hispanic Black, 17.2% Hispanic, and 1.8% Asian participants; 31.1%, 30.3%, and 38.6% were at moderate risk, high risk, or with ASCVD, respectively. Those with DM and ASCVD were most likely on SGLT2-i (8.6%) or GLP-1 RA (11.9%). SGLT2-i use was < 10% in those with heart failure or chronic kidney disease.

Although the coexistence of sarcoidosis and psoriasis in the same individuals has been reported, the potential association between these diseases at a population-level in the United States has not been evaluated. To evaluate this association, we performed a matched cross-sectional study in the All of Us research program database. In the multivariable analysis of 4932 psoriasis cases and 19,728 controls, sarcoidosis was found to be significantly associated with psoriasis (OR 2.37 [95% CI 1.73-3.23], p < 0.001). The relative strength of this association between psoriasis and sarcoidosis may be, in part, explained by overlapping immunopathogenesis and common genetic susceptibility of these diseases. Taken together, these observations underscore the need for screening psoriasis patients for development of new cardiopulmonary symptoms. Further research into the mechanism of this relationship and its implications is warranted.",Archives of dermatological research..,2023,Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Population Health; Psoriasis; Skin; Sarcoidosis,False,4

Aggregation of medical record data from multiple sites creates new challenges prompting the need to identify and correct errant values. We sought to characterize and correct issues with height and weight measurement values within the All of Us (AoU) Research Program. Using the AoU Researcher Workbench, we assessed site-level measurement value distributions to infer unit types. We also used plausibility checks with exceptions for conditions with possible outlier values, eg obesity, and assessed for excess deviation within individual participant's records. 15.8% of height and 22.4% of weight values had missing unit type information. We identified several measurement unit related issues: the use of different units of measure within and between sites, missing units, and incorrect labeling of units. Failure to account for these in patient data repositories may lead to erroneous study results and conclusions. Discrepancies in height and weight measurement data may arise from missing or mislabeled units. Using site- and participant-level analyses while accounting for outlier value-associated clinical conditions, we can infer measurement units and apply corrections. These methods are adaptable and expandable within AoU and other data repositories.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2022,Body Height; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Humans; Medical Records; Obesity; Population Health,False,9

Social and demographic covariates. Psychiatric disorders derived from International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, codes across 6 broad domains: mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, stress-related disorders, schizophrenia, and personality disorders. The analytic sample (N = 329 038) was 60.7% female (mean [SD] age, 50.9 [16.8] years). The prevalence of disorders ranged from 11.00% (95% CI, 10.68% to 11.32%) for any mood disorder to less than 1% (eg, obsessive-compulsive disorder, 0.18%; 95% CI, -0.16% to 0.52%), with mood disorders being the most common and personality disorders being the least.

We describe the demographic characteristics of participants who decline access to their EHR data. We included participants enrolling in AoURP between June 6, 2017 and December 31, 2019 through the Trans-American Consortium for the Health Care Systems Research Network (TACH). TACH is a consortium of health care systems spanning 6 states, and an AoURP research partner. We analyzed data for 25 852 participants (89.3% of those enrolled). Mean age = 52.0 years (SD 16.8), with 66.5% White, 18.7% Black/African American, 7.7% Hispanic, 32.5% female, and 76% with >a high school diploma. Overall, 2.3% of participants declined to share access to their EHR data (range across TACH sites = 1.3% to 3.5%).

All of Us,36396674,Investigation of hypertension and type 2 diabetes as risk factors for dementia in the All of Us cohort.,"The World Health Organization recently defined hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as modifiable comorbidities leading to dementia and Alzheimer's disease. In the United States (US), hypertension and T2D are health disparities, with higher prevalence seen for Black and Hispanic minority groups compared to the majority White population. We hypothesized that elevated prevalence of hypertension and T2D risk factors in Black and Hispanic groups may be associated with dementia disparities. We interrogated this hypothesis using a cross-sectional analysis of participant data from the All of Us (AoU) Research Program, a large observational cohort study of US residents. The specific objectives of our study were: (1) to compare the prevalence of dementia, hypertension, and T2D in the AoU cohort to previously reported prevalence values for the US population, (2) to investigate the association of hypertension, T2D, and race/ethnicity with dementia, and (3) to investigate whether race/ethnicity modify the association of hypertension and T2D with dementia. AoU participants were recruited from 2018 to 2019 as part of the initial project cohort (R2019Q4R3). Participants aged 40-80 with electronic health records and demographic data (age, sex, race, and ethnicity) were included for analysis, yielding a final cohort of 125,637 individuals. AoU participants show similar prevalence of hypertension (32.1%) and T2D (13.9%) compared to the US population (32.0% and 10.5%, respectively); however, the prevalence of dementia for AoU participants (0.44%) is an order of magnitude lower than seen for the US population (5%). AoU participants with dementia show a higher prevalence of hypertension (81.6% vs. 31.9%) and T2D (45.9% vs. 11.4%) compared to non-dementia participants. Dominance analysis of a multivariable logistic regression model with dementia as the outcome shows that hypertension, age, and T2D have the strongest associations with dementia. Hispanic was the only race/ethnicity group that showed a significant association with dementia, and the association of sex with dementia was non-significant. The association of T2D with dementia is likely explained by concurrent hypertension, since > 90% of participants with T2D also had hypertension. Black race and Hispanic ethnicity interact with hypertension, but not T2D, to increase the odds of dementia. This study underscores the utility of the AoU participant cohort to study disease prevalence and risk factors. We do notice a lower participation of aged minorities and participants with dementia, revealing an opportunity for targeted engagement. Our results indicate that targeting hypertension should be a priority for risk factor modifications to reduce dementia incidence.",Scientific reports,2022,"Humans; United States; Child, Preschool; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Cross-Sectional Studies; Population Health; Hypertension; Risk Factors; Cohort Studies",False,4

All of Us,34644234,Nature vs. Nurture in Precision Education: Insights of Parents and the Public.,"The philosophical debate about the roles of nature versus nurture in human flourishing is not new. But the rise of precision education-a growing field of research that encourages the use of genetic data to inform educational trajectory and interventions to better meet student needs-has renewed historical and ethical concerns. A major worry is that ""genetic hype"" may skew public perceptions toward a deterministic perception of the child's educational trajectory, regardless of the child's capacities, and underestimation of environmental factors affecting educational outcomes. We tested this hypothesis with parents and adults from the general public in the US. A newly developed computerized implicit association test (IAT) to assess automatic associations between genetics or environments and student behaviors that are associated with educational achievement was administered to samples of parents of children below 21 years old (n = 450) and adults from the general public (n = 419). The samples were representative of the adult US population and adjusted to oversample Black/African American participants. An overall D score for participants' IATs (range: [-2, 2]) was calculated on the basis of the speed of participants' responses. The mean IAT score for both samples indicated stronger association between the quality of being a good student and environment rather than genetics (parents: mean=-0.146, t = -6.56, p < 0.001; general public: mean = -0.249, t = -9.45, p < 0.0001). Younger participants from the general public showed a stronger association between genetics and educational success than middle-aged participants (β = -0.301, p = 0.006). The views of parents and the general public on behavioral genetics and education are complex but call for investment in creating educational environments that are supportive of student success. Future research is needed to understand differences across age groups and to explore views of other stakeholders involved in determining children's educational trajectories about the roles of nature versus nurture in precision education.",AJOB empirical bioethics,2022,Achievement; Adult; Child; Educational Status; Humans; Middle Aged; Parents; Young Adult,False,0

To examine the association of mental health with everyday discrimination during the pandemic in a large and diverse cohort of the All of Us Research Program. Using repeated assessments in the early months of the pandemic, mixed-effects models were fitted to assess the associations of discrimination with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, and inverse probability weights were applied to account for nonrandom probabilities of completing the voluntary survey. The exposure and outcome measures were ascertained using the Everyday Discrimination Scale and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. Scores for PHQ-9 that were greater than or equal to 10 were classified as moderate to severe depressive symptoms, and any positive response to the ninth item of the PHQ-9 scale was considered as presenting suicidal ideation. A total of 62 651 individuals (mean [SD] age, 59.3 [15.9] years; female sex at birth, 41 084 [65.6%]) completed at least 1 assessment between May and July 2020.

Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between reported cost-related barriers to medication adherence (could not afford prescription medication, skipped medication doses to save money, took less medication to save money, delayed filling a prescription to save money, asked for lower-cost medication to save money, bought prescriptions from another country to save money, and used alternative therapies to save money) and race and ethnicity, adjusting multivariable models by age, gender, health insurance status, education, and income. Odds ratios of these barriers were obtained by race and ethnicity, with non-Hispanic White race as the reference group. Of 3826 included patients with glaucoma, 481 (12.6%) were African American, 119 (3.1%) were non-Hispanic Asian, 351 (9.2%) were Hispanic, and 2875 (75.1%) were non-Hispanic White. The median (IQR) age was 69 (60-75) years, and 2307 (60.3%) were female. After adjusting for confounders, non-Hispanic African American individuals (odds ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.34-2.44) and Hispanic individuals (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.25-2.49) were more likely than non-Hispanic White individuals to report not being able to afford medications. Further, despite having the lowest rate of endorsing difficulty affording medications, non-Hispanic White individuals were equally likely to ask for lower-cost medication from their clinicians as individuals of racial and ethnic minority groups. In this study, there was significantly higher odds of self-reported difficulty affording medications among non-Hispanic African American and Hispanic individuals compared with non-Hispanic White individuals. Clinicians should be proactive and initiate discussions about costs in an effort to promote medication adherence and health equity among patients.",JAMA ophthalmology,2022,Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnicity; Female; Glaucoma; Humans; Male; Medication Adherence; Minority Groups; National Institutes of Health (U.S.); Population Health; United States,False,2

Engaging diverse community voices in large-scale, national research programs represents a paradigm shift in biomedical research. Still, disconnects remain between research decision makers and the communities they serve, impeding richer, bidirectional engagement. An engagement core team was established within National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program (AoURP) in 2018 to synthesize community-engaged research practices and establish infrastructure that operationalizes diverse research participant engagement. The authors integrated research participants as ""participant partners"" within the AoURP governance, an approach that is embedded into the engagement core's 3 aims: (1) integrate a diverse pool of participants into the program, (2) identify and meaningfully engage a cadre of diverse participants into program governance, and (3) assess the impact of such engagement on research. Participant partners are compensated as consultants at approximately $50/hour. As of August 2022, more than 515,000 individuals consented to participate in the AoURP, with more than 49% representing racial/ethnic minorities. The authors invited participants to self-nominate if interested in engaging in research working groups, decision making, and governance. Also, consortium partners nominated individuals on AoURP community advisory and/or participant advisory boards to serve as participant ambassadors. Ten individuals were selected as participant partners for the 2022-2025 term. Eight serve on the steering committee; of those, 4 serve on the executive committee; 2 more serve on the advisory panel. An additional 23 serve as participant ambassadors. The authors continue to increase the number of research participants serving as engaged partners in the program.

The meeting's goal was to articulate a research strategy to develop Genomics-based Clinical Informatics Tools and Resources (GCIT) to improve the detection, treatment, and reporting of genetic disorders in clinical settings. Experts from government agencies, the private sector, and academia in genomic medicine and clinical informatics were invited to address the meeting's goals. Invitees were also asked to complete a survey to assess important considerations needed to develop a genomic-based clinical informatics research strategy. Outcomes from the meeting included identifying short-term research needs, such as designing and implementing standards-based interfaces between laboratory information systems and electronic health records, as well as long-term projects, such as identifying and addressing barriers related to the establishment and implementation of genomic data exchange systems that, in turn, the research community could help address. Discussions centered on identifying gaps and barriers that impede the use of GCIT in genomic medicine. Emergent themes from the meeting included developing an implementation science framework, defining a value proposition for all stakeholders, fostering engagement with patients and partners to develop applications under patient control, promoting the use of relevant clinical workflows in research, and lowering related barriers to regulatory processes. Another key theme was recognizing pervasive biases in data and information systems, algorithms, access, value, and knowledge repositories and identifying ways to resolve them.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2022,"Electronic Health Records; Genome, Human; Genomics; Humans; Medical Informatics; Research Design",False,7

To characterize measures of socioeconomic status and barriers to healthcare access and utilization between patients with and without a diagnosis of glaucoma. Patients aged 65 years and over who enrolled in the NIH All of Us Research Program, a nationwide longitudinal cohort, were extracted. We analyzed demographic information and several measures of socioeconomic status and healthcare access and utilization. Survey responses were compared by glaucoma status (any type) with Pearson χ 2 tests, univariable logistic regression, and multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and insurance status. Of the 49,487 patients who answered at least 1 question on the All of Us Healthcare Access and Utilization Survey, 4441 (9.0%) had a diagnosis of glaucoma. Majority of the cohort was female (28,162, 56.9%) and nonHispanic White (42,008, 84.9%). Glaucoma patients were observed to have lower rates of education ( P =0.004), employment ( P <0.001), and home ownership ( P <0.001) on χ 2 tests.

This is a retrospective study involving data from the AoU program (R2020Q4R2, N = 315,297). Five vaccine cohorts [influenza, hepatitis B (HBV), pneumococcal <65 years old, pneumococcal ≥65 years old, and human papillomavirus (HPV)] were generated based on vaccination history. The influenza cohort comprised participants with documented influenza vaccinations in electronic health records (EHRs) from September 2017 to May 2018. Other vaccine cohorts comprised participants with ≥1 lifetime record(s) of vaccination documented in the EHR by December 2018. The vaccine cohorts were compared to the overall AoU cohort. Descriptive statistics were generated using EHR- and survey-based sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle information. The SAMBA (0.9.0) R package was utilized to adjust for EHR selection and outcome misclassification biases to infer sources of disparity for pneumococcal vaccinations in older adults. Cohort counts were as follows: influenza (n = 15,346), HBV (n = 6323), pneumococcal <65 (n = 15,217), pneumococcal ≥65 (n = 15,100), and HPV (n = 2125). All vaccine cohorts had higher proportions of White and non-Hispanic/Latino participants compared to the overall AoU cohort. The largest differences were found in pneumococcal age ≥65, with 80.2% White participants compared to 52.9% in the overall study population. Multivariable analysis revealed that race/ethnic disparities in pneumococcal vaccination among older adults were explained by biological sex, income, health insurance, and education-related variables. Racial, ethnic, education, and income characteristics differ across the vaccine cohorts among AoU participants.

The All of Us database offers extensive survey data pertaining to social determinants that is not routinely available in electronic health records. This study assesses whether social determinants were associated with an increased risk of developing proliferative diabetic retinopathy or related complications (e.g. related diagnoses or procedures). We identified 729 adult participants in the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program data repository with diabetic retinopathy (DR) who answered survey questions pertaining to healthcare access and utilization. Electronic health record data regarding co-morbidities, laboratory values, and procedures were extracted. Multivariable logistic regression with bi-directional stepwise variable selection was performed from a wide range of predictors. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. The mean (standard deviation) age of our cohort was 64.9 (11.4) years. 15.2% identified as Hispanic or Latino, 20.4% identified as Black, 60.6% identified as White, and 19.3% identified as Other. 10-20% of patients endorsed several reasons for avoiding or delaying care, including financial concerns and lack of access to transportation. Additional significant social determinants included race and religion discordance between healthcare provider and patient (odds ratio [OR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.41, p = 0.03) and caregiver responsibilities toward others (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.01-9.50, p = 0.04). Nationwide data demonstrate substantial barriers to healthcare access among DR patients.

This manuscript examines the research questions being addressed in prevention research by characterizing the distribution and trends of study designs included in primary and secondary prevention research supported by the National Institutes of Health through grants and cooperative agreements, together with the types of prevention research, populations, rationales, exposures, and outcomes associated with each type of design. The Office of Disease Prevention developed a taxonomy to classify new extramural NIH-funded research projects and created a database with a representative sample of 14,523 research projects for fiscal years 2012-2019. The data were weighted to represent the entirety of the extramural research portfolio. Leveraging this dataset, the Office of Disease Prevention characterized the study designs proposed in NIH-funded primary and secondary prevention research applications. The most common study designs proposed in new NIH-supported prevention research applications during FY12-19 were observational designs (63.3%, 95% CI 61.5%-65.0%), analysis of existing data (44.5%, 95% CI: 42.7-46.3), methods research (23.9%, 95% CI: 22.3-25.6), and randomized interventions (17.2%, 95% CI: 16.1%-18.4%). Observational study designs dominated primary prevention research, while intervention designs were more common in secondary prevention research. Observational designs were more common for exposures that would be difficult to manipulate (e.g., genetics, chemical toxin, and infectious disease (not pneumonia/influenza or HIV/AIDS)), while intervention designs were more common for exposures that would be easier to manipulate (e.g., education/counseling, medication/device, diet/nutrition, and healthcare delivery). Intervention designs were not common for outcomes that are rare or have a long latency (e.g., cancer, neurological disease, Alzheimer's disease) and more common for outcomes that are more common or where effects would be expected earlier (e.g., healthcare delivery, health related quality of life, substance use, and medication/device). Observational designs and analyses of existing data dominated, suggesting that much of the prevention research funded by NIH continues to focus on questions of association and on questions of identification of risk and protective factors. Randomized and non-randomized intervention designs were included far less often, suggesting that a much smaller fraction of the NIH prevention research portfolio is focused on questions of whether interventions can be used to modify risk or protective factors or to change some other health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome. The much heavier focus on observational studies is surprising given how much we know already about the leading risk factors for death and disability in the USA, because those risk factors account for 74% of the county-level mortality in the USA, and because they play such a vital role in the development of clinical and public health guidelines, whose developers often weigh results from randomized trials much more heavily than results from observational studies. Improvements in death and disability nationwide are more likely to derive from guidelines based on intervention research to address the leading risk factors than from additional observational studies.",Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research,2022,Health Services Research; Humans; National Institutes of Health (U.S.); Quality of Life; Research Design; Secondary Prevention; United States,False,3
All of Us,35641135,Forecasting the future clinical events of a patient through contrastive learning.,"Deep learning models for clinical event forecasting (CEF) based on a patient's medical history have improved significantly over the past decade. However, their transition into practice has been limited, particularly for diseases with very low prevalence. In this paper, we introduce CEF-CL, a novel method based on contrastive learning to forecast in the face of a limited number of positive training instances. CEF-CL consists of two primary components: (1) unsupervised contrastive learning for patient representation and (2) supervised transfer learning over the derived representation. We evaluate the new method along with state-of-the-art model architectures trained in a supervised manner with electronic health records data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the All of Us Research Program, covering 48 000 and 16 000 patients, respectively. We assess forecasting for over 100 diagnosis codes with respect to their area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). We investigate the correlation between forecasting performance improvement and code prevalence via a Wald Test. CEF-CL achieved an average AUROC and AUPRC performance improvement over the state-of-the-art of 8.0%-9.3% and 11.7%-32.0%, respectively. The improvement in AUROC was negatively correlated with the number of positive training instances (P < .001). This investigation indicates that clinical event forecasting can be improved significantly through contrastive representation learning, especially when the number of positive training instances is small.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2022,Electronic Health Records; Forecasting; Humans; Population Health,False,1

During the MELD era, sex disparities in liver transplant have increased and there are no modifications to MELD based on sex. To use laboratory values stored in electronic health records to describe population-level sex differences in all MELD laboratory values (in healthy individuals and patients with liver disease) and propose a sex adjustment. A retrospective cohort study was conducted from March 2019 to April 2020 to evaluate sex differences in laboratory values in liver transplant patients, patients with liver disease who did not undergo transplant, and healthy controls. Primary analyses were conducted in Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC)'s deidentified electronic health record system. Replication analyses were conducted in the All of Us Research Program. Simulations of a sex-adjusted sodium-adjusted MELD (MELDNa) score were completed using liver transplant waiting list data from the liver simulated allocation modeling system. Patients who regularly used VUMC with measurements for any MELDNa component laboratory were included in the analyses. Analysis took place from November 2019 to March 2021. Electronic health record-reported sex. Creatinine, bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and sodium levels. The VUMC sample was composed of 623 931 individuals (359 976 [57.7%] female) with a median (IQR) age of 44 (23-61) years. All component MELDNa laboratory values and calculated MELDNa scores yielded significant sex differences within VUMC (mean [SD] creatinine: male, 0.99 [0.39] mg/dL; female, 0.79 [0.30] mg/dL; P < .001; bilirubin: male, 0.76 [0.83] mg/dL; female, 0.58 [0.64] mg/dL; P < .001; international normalized ratio of prothrombin rate: male, 1.24 [0.42]; female, 1.20 [0.40]; P < .001; sodium: male, 139.00 [2.36] mEq/L; female, 139.03 [2.28] mEq/L; P < .001), resulting in MELDNa scoring that disadvantaged female individuals. This pattern persisted when the sample was divided into healthy controls, individuals with liver disease who did not undergo transplant, and patients who did undergo liver transplant. Female transplant patients had a greater number of decompensation traits (mean [SD]: male, 1.34 [1.11]; female, 1.60 [1.09]; P = .005), despite having lower MELDNa scores (mean [SD]: male, 21.72 [6.11]; female, 20.21 [6.15]; P = .005), indicating MELDNa scores are not accurately representing disease severity in female individuals. In simulations, the sex-adjusted MELDNa score modestly increased female transplant rate and decreased overall death. These results demonstrate pervasive sex differences in all laboratory values used in MELDNa scoring and highlight the need and utility of a sex-adjustment to the MELDNa protocol.",JAMA surgery,2022,Adult; Bilirubin; Creatinine; End Stage Liver Disease; Female; Humans; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Population Health; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Sodium; Waiting Lists,False,2

The objective of this study was to better understand older, multi-ethnic populations' (1) perceptions of the value of cancer biobanking research, (2) study design preferences, and (3) guidance on ways to promote and increase participation. This study was designed using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach and involved eight FGDs with 67 older (65-74 years old) black and white residents from Baltimore City and Prince George's County, MD. FGDs lasted between 90 and 120 min, and participants received a $25 Target gift card for their participation. Analysis involved an inductive approach in which we went through a series of open and axial coding techniques to generate themes and subthemes. Multiple themes emerged from the FGDs for the development of future cancer-related biobanking research including (1) expectations/anticipated benefits, (2) biobanking design preferences, and (3) ways to optimize participation. Overall, most participants were willing to provide biospecimens and favored cancer-related biobank. To increase participation of older, diverse participants in biobanking protocols, researchers need to engage older, diverse persons as consultants in order to better understand the value of biobanking research to individuals from the various populations.

Because complete mortality ascertainment is essential for accurate calibration, we restricted analyses to cohorts with mortality from the National Death Index or equivalent sources. VACS Index 2.0 components were ascertained from October 1999 to April 2018. Mortality was observed up to March 2019. Calibration curves compared predicted (estimated by fitting a gamma model to the score) to observed mortality overall and within subgroups: cohort (VACS/NA-ACCORD subset), sex, age <50 or ≥50 years, race/ethnicity, HIV-1 RNA ≤500 or >500 copies/mL, CD4 count <350 or ≥350 cells/µL, and years 1999-2009 or 2010-2018. Because mortality rates have decreased over time, the final model was limited to 2010-2018. Among 37230 PWH in VACS and 8061 PWH in the NA-ACCORD subset, median age was 53 and 44 years; 3% and 19% were women; and 48% and 39% were black. Discrimination in NA-ACCORD (C-statistic = 0.842 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .830-.854]) was better than in VACS (C-statistic = 0.813 [95% CI, .809-.817]). Predicted and observed mortality largely overlapped in VACS and the NA-ACCORD subset, overall and within subgroups. Based on this validation, VACS Index 2.0 can reliably estimate probability of all-cause mortality, at various follow-up times, among PWH in North America.",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2022,Aging; Calibration; Cohort Studies; Female; HIV; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; North America; Veterans,False,2

This study investigated the concordance of results across four immunoassays targeting different antigens for sera collected at the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States. Specimens from All of Us participants contributed between January and March 2020 were tested using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG (immunoglobulin G) assay (Abbott) and the EuroImmun SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (EI). Participants with discordant results, participants with concordant positive results, and a subset of concordant negative results by Abbott and EI were also tested using the Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) test (Roche) and the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Vitros anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test (Ortho). The agreement and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for paired assay combinations. SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations were quantified for specimens with at least two positive results across four immunoassays. Among the 24,079 participants, the percent agreement for the Abbott and EI assays was 98.8% (95% confidence interval, 98.7%, 99%). Of the 490 participants who were also tested by Ortho and Roche, the probability-weighted percentage of agreement (95% confidence interval) between Ortho and Roche was 98.4% (97.9%, 98.9%), that between EI and Ortho was 98.5% (92.9%, 99.9%), that between Abbott and Roche was 98.9% (90.3%, 100.0%), that between EI and Roche was 98.9% (98.6%, 100.0%), and that between Abbott and Ortho was 98.4% (91.2%, 100.0%). Among the 32 participants who were positive by at least 2 immunoassays, 21 had quantifiable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations by research assays. The results across immunoassays revealed concordance during a period of low prevalence. However, the frequency of false positivity during a period of low prevalence supports the use of two sequentially performed tests for unvaccinated individuals who are seropositive by the first test.

All of Us,34920126,Membership inference attacks against synthetic health data.,"Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising method to protect patient privacy while sharing individual-level health data. Intuitively, sharing synthetic data should reduce disclosure risks because no explicit linkage is retained between the synthetic records and the real data upon which it is based. However, the risks associated with synthetic data are still evolving, and what seems protected today may not be tomorrow. In this paper, we show that membership inference attacks, whereby an adversary infers if the data from certain target individuals (known to the adversary a priori) were relied upon by the synthetic data generation process, can be substantially enhanced through state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, which calls into question the protective nature of existing synthetic data generators. Specifically, we formulate the membership inference problem from the perspective of the data holder, who aims to perform a disclosure risk assessment prior to sharing any health data. To support such an assessment, we introduce a framework for effective membership inference against synthetic health data without specific assumptions about the generative model or a well-defined data structure, leveraging the principles of contrastive representation learning. To illustrate the potential for such an attack, we conducted experiments against synthesis approaches using two datasets derived from several health data resources (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the All of Us Research Program) to determine the upper bound of risk brought by an adversary who invokes an optimal strategy. The results indicate that partially synthetic data are vulnerable to membership inference at a very high rate. By contrast, fully synthetic data are only marginally susceptible and, in most cases, could be deemed sufficiently protected from membership inference.",Journal of biomedical informatics,2022,Confidentiality; Disclosure; Genomics; Humans; Machine Learning; Population Health,False,7

Recently, there has been a surge of digital health studies where data are collected through a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) approach, in which participants who already own a specific technology may voluntarily sign up for the study and provide their digital health data. BYOD study design accelerates the collection of data from a larger number of participants than cohort design; this is possible because researchers are not limited in the study population size based on the number of devices afforded by their budget or the number of people familiar with the technology. However, the BYOD study design may not support the collection of data from a representative random sample of the target population where digital health technologies are intended to be deployed. This may result in biased study results and biased downstream technology development, as has occurred in other fields.

To estimate the rate and risk of severe breakthrough illness among vaccinated PWH and people without HIV (PWoH) who experience a breakthrough infection. In this cohort study, the Corona-Infectious-Virus Epidemiology Team (CIVET-II) collaboration included adults (aged ≥18 years) with HIV who were receiving care and were fully vaccinated by June 30, 2021, along with PWoH matched according to date fully vaccinated, age group, race, ethnicity, and sex from 4 US integrated health systems and academic centers. Those with postvaccination COVID-19 breakthrough before December 31, 2021, were eligible. HIV infection. The main outcome was severe COVID-19 breakthrough illness, defined as hospitalization within 28 days after a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection with a primary or secondary COVID-19 discharge diagnosis. Discrete time proportional hazards models estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% CIs of severe breakthrough illness within 28 days of breakthrough COVID-19 by HIV status adjusting for demographic variables, COVID-19 vaccine type, and clinical factors. The proportion of patients who received mechanical ventilation or died was compared by HIV status. Among 3649 patients with breakthrough COVID-19 (1241 PWH and 2408 PWoH), most were aged 55 years or older (2182 patients [59.8%]) and male (3244 patients [88.9%]). The cumulative incidence of severe illness in the first 28 days was low and comparable between PWoH and PWH (7.3% vs 6.7%; risk difference, -0.67%; 95% CI, -2.58% to 1.23%). The risk of severe breakthrough illness was 59% higher in PWH with CD4 cell counts less than 350 cells/μL compared with PWoH (aHR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.99 to 2.46; P = .049). In multivariable analyses among PWH, being female, older, having a cancer diagnosis, and lower CD4 cell count were associated with increased risk of severe breakthrough illness, whereas previous COVID-19 was associated with reduced risk. Among 249 hospitalized patients, 24 (9.6%) were mechanically ventilated and 20 (8.0%) died, with no difference by HIV status. In this cohort study, the risk of severe COVID-19 breakthrough illness within 28 days of a breakthrough infection was low among vaccinated PWH and PWoH. PWH with moderate or severe immune suppression had a higher risk of severe breakthrough infection and should be included in groups prioritized for additional vaccine doses and risk-reduction strategies.",JAMA network open,2022,Adolescent; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Cohort Studies; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; HIV Infections; SARS-CoV-2,False,2

We designed a decision analytic Markov model to compare the current standard of care for heterozygous FH diagnosis in Australia (opportunistic cholesterol screening and genetic cascade testing) with the alternate strategy of population genomic screening of adults aged 18-40 years to detect pathogenic variants in the LDLR/APOB/PCSK9 genes. We used a validated cost-adaptation method to adapt findings to eight high-income countries. The model captured coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity/mortality over a lifetime horizon, from healthcare and societal perspectives. Risk of CHD, treatment effects, prevalence, and healthcare costs were estimated from published studies. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), discounted 5% annually. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to explore the impact of key input parameters on the robustness of the model. Over the lifetime of the population (4 167 768 men; 4 129 961 women), the model estimated a gain of 33 488years of life lived and 51 790 QALYs due to CHD prevention. Population genomic screening for FH would be cost-effective from a healthcare perspective if the per-test cost was ≤AU$250, yielding an ICER of <AU$28 000 per QALY gained. From a societal perspective, population genomic screening would be cost-saving. ICERs from societal perspective remained cost-saving after adaptation to other countries. Based on our model, offering population genomic screening to all young adults for FH could be cost-effective, at testing costs that are feasible.",European heart journal,2022,Coronary Disease; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II; Male; Metagenomics; Proprotein Convertase 9; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Young Adult,False,2

We apply this approach to find drug repurposing candidates for two diseases, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. We screen >21,000 compounds and replicate ten approved drugs. We also identify 25 (seven for hyperlipidemia, eighteen for hypertension) drugs approved for other indications with therapeutic effects on clinically relevant biomarkers. For five of these drugs, the therapeutic effects are replicated in the All of Us Research Program database.

Previous work has shown that Cox regression, which can account for left truncation and right censoring in EHRs, increased the power to detect genotype-phenotype associations compared to logistic regression. We extend this to evaluate the relative performance of Cox regression and various logistic regression models in the presence of positive errors in event time (delayed event time), relating to recorded event time accuracy. One Cox model and three logistic regression models were considered under different scenarios of delayed event time. Extensive simulations and a genomic study application were used to evaluate the impact of delayed event time. While logistic regression does not model the time-to-event directly, various logistic regression models used in the literature were more sensitive to delayed event time than Cox regression. Results highlighted the importance to identify and exclude the patients diagnosed before entry time. Cox regression had similar or modest improvement in statistical power over various logistic regression models at controlled type I error. This was supported by the empirical data, where the Cox models steadily had the highest sensitivity to detect known genotype-phenotype associations under all scenarios of delayed event time.

All of Us,35927974,Keeping synthetic patients on track: feedback mechanisms to mitigate performance drift in longitudinal health data simulation.,"Synthetic data are increasingly relied upon to share electronic health record (EHR) data while maintaining patient privacy. Current simulation methods can generate longitudinal data, but the results are unreliable for several reasons. First, the synthetic data drifts from the real data distribution over time. Second, the typical approach to quality assessment, which is based on the extent to which real records can be distinguished from synthetic records using a critic model, often fails to recognize poor simulation results. In this article, we introduce a longitudinal simulation framework, called LS-EHR, which addresses these issues. LS-EHR enhances simulation through conditional fuzzing and regularization, rejection sampling, and prior knowledge embedding. We compare LS-EHR to the state-of-the-art using data from 60 000 EHRs from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and the All of Us Research Program. We assess discrimination between real and synthetic data over time. We evaluate the generation process and critic model using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). For the critic, a higher value indicates a more robust model for quality assessment. For the generation process, a lower value indicates better synthetic data quality. The LS-EHR critic improves discrimination AUROC from 0.655 to 0.909 and 0.692 to 0.918 for VUMC and All of Us data, respectively. By using the new critic, the LS-EHR generation model reduces the AUROC from 0.909 to 0.758 and 0.918 to 0.806.

Multiple signatures of varying size, complexity, and target populations have been described. However, there is little information to indicate how the performance of various published signatures compare to one another. This systematic comparison of host gene expression signatures evaluated the performance of 28 signatures, validating them in 4589 subjects from 51 publicly available datasets. Thirteen COVID-specific datasets with 1416 subjects were included in a separate analysis. Individual signature performance was evaluated using the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) value. Overall signature performance was evaluated using median AUCs and accuracies. Signature performance varied widely, with median AUCs ranging from 0.55 to 0.96 for bacterial classification and 0.69-0.97 for viral classification. Signature size varied (1-398 genes), with smaller signatures generally performing more poorly (P < 0.04). Viral infection was easier to diagnose than bacterial infection (84% vs. 79% overall accuracy, respectively; P < .001). Host gene expression classifiers performed more poorly in some pediatric populations (3 months-1 year and 2-11 years) compared to the adult population for both bacterial infection (73% and 70% vs. 82%, respectively; P < .001) and viral infection (80% and 79% vs. 88%, respectively; P < .001). We did not observe classification differences based on illness severity as defined by ICU admission for bacterial or viral infections. The median AUC across all signatures for COVID-19 classification was 0.80 compared to 0.83 for viral classification in the same datasets. In this systematic comparison of 28 host gene expression signatures, we observed differences based on a signature's size and characteristics of the validation population, including age and infection type. However, populations used for signature discovery did not impact performance, underscoring the redundancy among many of these signatures.

All of Us,34930020,Arrhythmia Variant Associations and Reclassifications in the eMERGE-III Sequencing Study.,"Sequencing Mendelian arrhythmia genes in individuals without an indication for arrhythmia genetic testing can identify carriers of pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants. However, the extent to which these variants are associated with clinically meaningful phenotypes before or after return of variant results is unclear. In addition, the majority of discovered variants are currently classified as variants of uncertain significance, limiting clinical actionability. The eMERGE-III study (Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Phase III) is a multicenter prospective cohort that included 21 846 participants without previous indication for cardiac genetic testing. Participants were sequenced for 109 Mendelian disease genes, including 10 linked to arrhythmia syndromes. Variant carriers were assessed with electronic health record-derived phenotypes and follow-up clinical examination. Selected variants of uncertain significance (n=50) were characterized in vitro with automated electrophysiology experiments in HEK293 cells. As previously reported, 3.0% of participants had P/LP variants in the 109 genes. Herein, we report 120 participants (0.6%) with P/LP arrhythmia variants. Compared with noncarriers, arrhythmia P/LP carriers had a significantly higher burden of arrhythmia phenotypes in their electronic health records. Fifty-four participants had variant results returned. Nineteen of these 54 participants had inherited arrhythmia syndrome diagnoses (primarily long-QT syndrome), and 12 of these 19 diagnoses were made only after variant results were returned (0.05%). After in vitro functional evaluation of 50 variants of uncertain significance, we reclassified 11 variants: 3 to likely benign and 8 to P/LP. Genome sequencing in a large population without indication for arrhythmia genetic testing identified phenotype-positive carriers of variants in congenital arrhythmia syndrome disease genes. As the genomes of large numbers of people are sequenced, the disease risk from rare variants in arrhythmia genes can be assessed by integrating genomic screening, electronic health record phenotypes, and in vitro functional studies.

However, the pleiotropic effects of these genes are not fully known. Such effects could complicate genetic counseling when returning incidental findings. In particular, there has been no systematic evaluation of psychiatric manifestations associated with rare variation in these genes. Here, we leveraged a targeted sequence panel and real-world electronic health records from the eMERGE network to assess the burden of rare variation in the ACMG-56 genes and two psychiatric-associated genes (CACNA1C  and TCF4) across common mental health conditions in 15,181 individuals of European descent.

Other risk factors associated with OAG included being Black (HR, 3.31, 95% CI, 2.63-4.17), Hispanic or Latino (HR, 2.53, 95% CI, 1.94-3.28), Asian (HR, 2.22, 95% CI, 1.24-3.97), older in age (80+ years, HR, 20.1, 95% CI, 9.10-44.5), and diabetic (HR, 1.32, 95% CI, 1.04-1.67). Female gender was associated with decreased hazard of developing OAG (HR, 0.66, 95% CI, 0.55-0.80). No significant interaction was observed between MAP and the number of BP medications on the risk of developing OAG. We found that low BP is associated with increased risk of developing OAG in a national longitudinal EHR database. We did not find evidence supporting a differential effect of medically treated and untreated low BP.

All of Us,36585416,Pre-exposure cognitive performance variability is associated with severity of respiratory infection.,"Using data from a longitudinal viral challenge study, we find that the post-exposure viral shedding and symptom severity are associated with a novel measure of pre-exposure cognitive performance variability (CPV), defined before viral exposure occurs. Each individual's CPV score is computed from data collected from a repeated NeuroCognitive Performance Test (NCPT) over a 3 day pre-exposure period. Of the 18 NCPT measures reported by the tests, 6 contribute materially to the CPV score, prospectively differentiating the high from the low shedders. Among these 6 are the 4 clinical measures digSym-time, digSym-correct, trail-time, and reaction-time, commonly used for assessing cognitive executive functioning. CPV is found to be correlated with stress and also with several genes previously reported to be associated with cognitive development and dysfunction. A perturbation study over the number and timing of NCPT sessions indicates that as few as 5 sessions is sufficient to maintain high association between the CPV score and viral shedding, as long as the timing of these sessions is balanced over the three pre-exposure days. Our results suggest that variations in cognitive function are closely related to immunity and susceptibility to severe infection. Further studying these relationships may help us better understand the links between neurocognitive and neuroimmune systems which is timely in this COVID-19 pandemic era.",Scientific reports,2022,Humans; Pandemics; COVID-19; Cognition; Reaction Time; Respiratory Tract Infections,False,9

This study aimed to elucidate the overall clinical risk of obesity using a genome- and phenome-wide approach. This study performed a phenome-wide association study of BMI using a clinical cohort of 736,726 adults. This was followed by genetic association studies using two separate cohorts: one consisting of 65,174 adults in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network and another with 405,432 participants in the UK Biobank. Class 3 obesity was associated with 433 phenotypes, representing 59.3% of all billing codes in individuals with severe obesity. A genome-wide polygenic risk score for BMI, accounting for 7.5% of variance in BMI, was associated with 296 clinical diseases, including strong associations with type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, hypertension, and chronic liver disease. In all three cohorts, 199 phenotypes were associated with class 3 obesity and polygenic risk for obesity, including novel associations such as increased risk of renal failure, venous insufficiency, and gastroesophageal reflux. This combined genomic and phenomic systematic approach demonstrated that obesity has a strong genetic predisposition and is associated with a considerable burden of disease across all disease classes.","Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",2022,"Humans; Phenomics; Electronic Health Records; Genome-Wide Association Study; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genomics; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Obesity; Phenotype; Cost of Illness",False,7

Observational study of participants in the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD). We estimated the annual prevalence between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2017 of mild (11.0-12.9 g/dl men, 11.0-11.9 g/dl women), moderate (8.0-10.9 g/dl regardless of sex) and severe (<8.0 g/dl regardless of sex) anemia. Poisson regression models with robust variance and general estimating equations estimated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with 95% confidence intervals ([-]) comparing risk factors for moderate/severe vs. no/mild anemia between 2007 and 2017. Among 73 898 PWH we observed 366 755 hemoglobin measurements following ART initiation, 37 301 (50%) had one or more measures of anemia during follow-up (mild = 17 743 [24%]; moderate = 13 383[18%]; severe = 6175 [8%]). Moderate/severe anemia was more prevalent among women, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic PWH (vs. non-Hispanic white), those with underweight body mass index (<18.5 kg/m2) and with comorbidities and coinfections. Older age had increased prevalence of moderate/severe anemia among males and decreased prevalence among females. Prevalence of moderate/severe anemia was greater among those with lower CD4+ cell count (≤200 cells/μl) [aPR = 2.11 (2.06-2.17)] unsuppressed HIV viral load (>200 copies/ml) [aPR = 1.26 (1.23-1.29)] and within the first 6 months of ART initiation (vs. >1 year of ART) [aPR = 1.66 (1.61-1.72)]. The prevalence of anemia among PWH is reduced after ART initiation but remains high. Risk factors differ by sex and include comorbidities and HIV disease severity.

Understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection risk after vaccination among PWH is essential for informing vaccination guidelines. To estimate the rate and risk of breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated PWH and people without HIV (PWoH) in the United States. This cohort study used the Corona-Infectious-Virus Epidemiology Team (CIVET)-II (of the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design [NA-ACCORD], which is part of the International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS [IeDEA]), collaboration of 4 prospective, electronic health record-based cohorts from integrated health systems and academic health centers. Adult PWH who were fully vaccinated prior to June 30, 2021, were matched with PWoH on date of full vaccination, age, race and ethnicity, and sex and followed up through December 31, 2021. HIV infection. COVID-19 breakthrough infections, defined as laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 diagnosis after a patient was fully vaccinated. Among 113 994 patients (33 029 PWH and 80 965 PWoH), most were 55 years or older (80 017 [70%]) and male (104 967 [92%]); 47 098 (41%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 43 218 (38%) were non-Hispanic White. The rate of breakthrough infections was higher in PWH vs PWoH (55 [95% CI, 52-58] cases per 1000 person-years vs 43 [95% CI, 42-45] cases per 1000 person-years). Cumulative incidence of breakthroughs 9 months after full vaccination was low (3.8% [95% CI, 3.7%-3.9%]), albeit higher in PWH vs PWoH (4.4% vs 3.5%; log-rank P < .001; risk difference, 0.9% [95% CI, 0.6%-1.2%]) and within each vaccine type. Breakthrough infection risk was 28% higher in PWH vs PWoH (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.19-1.37]). Among PWH, younger age (<45 y vs 45-54 y), history of COVID-19, and not receiving an additional dose (aHR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.58-0.88]) were associated with increased risk of breakthrough infections. There was no association of breakthrough with HIV viral load suppression, but high CD4 count (ie, ≥500 cells/mm3) was associated with fewer breakthroughs among PWH. In this study, COVID-19 vaccination, especially with an additional dose, was effective against infection with SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating through December 31, 2021. PWH had an increased risk of breakthrough infections compared with PWoH.

The authors determined whether biomarkers of inflammation and myocardial injury-interleukin (IL)-6 and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn)-were associated with the presence and extent of CAD and were independent predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in stable chest pain. Using participants from the PROMISE trial, the authors measured hs-cTn I and IL-6 concentrations and analyzed computed tomography angiography (CTA) images in the core laboratory for CAD characteristics: significant stenosis (≥70%), high-risk plaque (HRP), Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) categories, segment involvement score (SIS), and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. The primary endpoint was a composite MACE (death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina). The authors included 1,796 participants (age 60.2 ± 8.0 years; 47.5% men, median follow-up 25 months). In multivariable linear regression adjusted for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, hs-cTn was associated with HRP, stenosis, CAD-RADS, and SIS. IL-6 was only associated with stenosis and CAD-RADS. hs-cTn above median (1.5 ng/L) was associated with MACEs in univariable analysis (HR: 2.1 [95% CI: 1.3-3.6]; P = 0.006), but not in multivariable analysis adjusted for ASCVD and CAD. IL-6 above median (1.8 ng/L) was associated with MACEs in multivariable analysis adjusted for ASCVD and HRP (HR: 1.9 [95% CI: 1.1-3.3]; P = 0.03), CAC (HR: 1.9 [95% CI: 1.0-3.4]; P = 0.04), and SIS (HR: 1.8 [95% CI: 1.0-3.2]; P = 0.04), but not for stenosis or CAD-RADS. In participants with nonobstructive CAD (stenosis 1%-69%), the presence of both hs-cTn and IL-6 above median was strongly associated with MACEs (HR: 2.5-2.7 after adjustment for CAD characteristics). Concentrations of hs-cTn and IL-6 were associated with CAD characteristics and MACEs, indicating that myocardial injury and inflammation may each contribute to pathways in CAD pathophysiology. This association was most pronounced among participants with nonobstructive CAD representing an opportunity to tailor treatment in this at-risk group.

Population genomic screening for other conditions has increased ascertainment of individuals with pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants, leading to improved management and earlier diagnoses. It is unknown whether such benefits occur when screening broader populations for P/LP ETS variants. This manuscript assesses clinical utility outcomes of a large, unselected, healthcare-based genomic screening program by describing personal and family history of syndrome-related features, risk management behaviors after result disclosure, and rates of relevant post-disclosure diagnoses in patient-participants with P/LP ETS variants. Observational study of individuals informed of a P/LP variant in MEN1, RET, SDHAF2, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, or VHL through Geisinger's MyCode Community Health Initiative between June 2016 and October 2019. Electronic health records (EHRs) of participants were evaluated for a report of pre-disclosure personal and self-reported family histories and post-disclosure risk management and diagnoses. P/LP variants in genes of interest were identified in 199 of 130,490 (1 in 656) adult Geisinger MyCode patient-participants, 80 of which were disclosed during the study period. Eighty-one percent (n = 65) did not have prior evidence of the result in their EHR and, because they were identified via MyCode, were included in further analyses. Five participants identified via MyCode (8%) had a personal history of syndrome-related features; 16 (25%) had a positive self-reported family history. Time from result disclosure to EHR review was a median of 0.7 years. Post-disclosure, 36 (55.4%) completed a recommended risk management behavior; 11 (17%) were diagnosed with a syndrome-related neoplasm after completing a risk management intervention. Broader screening for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants associated with endocrine tumor syndromes enables detection of at-risk individuals, leads to the uptake of risk management, and facilitates relevant diagnoses. Further research will be necessary to continue to determine the clinical utility of screening diverse, unselected populations for such variants.",BMC medicine,2022,Adult; Delivery of Health Care; Genetic Testing; Humans; Metagenomics; Neoplasms; Syndrome,False,5

Our team developed a culturally sensitive, narrative decision aid video to promote uptake of genetic counseling among Black women at risk for a hereditary breast cancer syndrome that can be incorporated in conjunction with population-based cancer risk assessment in a clinical setting. We report here a pilot study to demonstrate changes in intention to access genetic counseling and intervention satisfaction. Black women who were personally unaffected by breast cancer and were recommended for genetic counseling based on family history screening in a mammography center were recruited at the time of the mammogram. A prospective, pre-post survey study design, guided by theoretical constructs, was used to evaluate baseline and immediate post-intervention psychosocial factors, including intention to participate in genetic counseling and intervention satisfaction. Pilot recruitment goals were met (n = 30). Pre-intervention, 50% of participants indicated that they were extremely likely to make a genetic counseling appointment, compared with 70% post-intervention (p = 0.05).

From September 2020 to March 2021, the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) research consortium surveyed 238 HIV care sites across seven geographic regions to document constraints in HIV service delivery during the first year of the pandemic and strategies for ensuring care continuity for PWH. Descriptive statistics were stratified by national HIV prevalence (<1%, 1-4.9% and ≥5%) and country income levels. Questions about pandemic-related consequences for HIV care were completed by 225 (95%) sites in 42 countries with low (n = 82), medium (n = 86) and high (n = 57) HIV prevalence, including low- (n = 57), lower-middle (n = 79), upper-middle (n = 39) and high- (n = 50) income countries. Most sites reported being subject to pandemic-related restrictions on travel, service provision or other operations (75%), and experiencing negative impacts (76%) on clinic operations, including decreased hours/days, reduced provider availability, clinic reconfiguration for COVID-19 services, record-keeping interruptions and suspension of partner support. Almost all sites in low-prevalence and high-income countries reported increased use of telemedicine (85% and 100%, respectively), compared with less than half of sites in high-prevalence and lower-income settings. Few sites in high-prevalence settings (2%) reported suspending antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic services, and many reported adopting mitigation strategies to support adherence, including multi-month dispensing of ART (95%) and designating community ART pick-up points (44%).

We explore whether the elevation in 5-year mortality would have persisted if all adults with HIV had initiated antiretroviral therapy within 3 months of entering care. Among 82 766 adults entering HIV care at North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration clinical sites in the United States, we computed mortality over 5 years since entry into HIV care under observed treatment patterns. We then used inverse probability weights to estimate mortality under universal early treatment. To compare mortality with those for similar individuals in the general population, we used National Center for Health Statistics data to construct a cohort representing the subset of the US population matched to study participants on key characteristics. For the entire study period (1999-2017), the 5-year mortality among adults with HIV was 7.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.6%-8.2%) higher than expected based on the US general population. Under universal early treatment, the elevation in mortality for people with HIV would have been 7.2% (95% CI: 5.8%-8.6%). In the most recent calendar period examined (2011-2017), the elevation in mortality for people with HIV was 2.6% (95% CI: 2.0%-3.3%) under observed treatment patterns and 2.1% (.0%-4.2%) under universal early treatment.

All of Us,36652671,A practical approach to curate clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in human genetic data sets.,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common form of age-related somatic mosaicism that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. CHIP mutations can be identified in peripheral blood samples that are sequenced using approaches that cover the whole genome, the whole exome, or targeted genetic regions; however, differentiating true CHIP mutations from sequencing artifacts and germ line variants is a considerable bioinformatic challenge. We present a stepwise method that combines filtering based on sequencing metrics, variant annotation, and population-based associations to increase the accuracy of CHIP calls. We apply this approach to ascertain CHIP in ∼550 000 individuals in the UK Biobank complete whole exome cohort and the All of Us Research Program initial whole genome release cohort. CHIP ascertainment on this scale unmasks recurrent artifactual variants and highlights the importance of specialized filtering approaches for several genes, including TET2 and ASXL1. We show how small changes in filtering parameters can considerably increase CHIP misclassification and reduce the effect size of epidemiological associations. Our high-fidelity call set refines previous population-based associations of CHIP with incident outcomes. For example, the annualized incidence of myeloid malignancy in individuals with small CHIP clones is 0.03% per year, which increases to 0.5% per year among individuals with very large CHIP clones. We also find a significantly lower prevalence of CHIP in individuals of self-reported Latino or Hispanic ethnicity in All of Us, highlighting the importance of including diverse populations. The standardization of CHIP calling will increase the fidelity of CHIP epidemiological work and is required for clinical CHIP diagnostic assays.",Blood,2023,Humans; Clonal Hematopoiesis; Hematopoiesis; Population Health; Mutation; Human Genetics,False,9

All of Us,36205043,The Impact of COVID-19 on the All of Us Research Program.,"The All of Us Research Program, a health and genetics epidemiologic data collection program, has been substantially affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although the program is highly digital in nature, certain aspects of the data collection require in-person interaction between staff and participants. Before the pandemic, the program was enrolling approximately 12,500 participants per month at more than 400 clinical sites. In March 2020, because of the pandemic, all in-person activity at program sites and by engagement partners was paused to develop processes and procedures for in-person activities that incorporated strict safety protocols. In addition, the program adopted new data collection methodologies to reduce the need for in-person activities. Through February 2022, a total of 224 clinical sites had reactivated in-person activity, and all enrollment and engagement partners have adopted new data collection methods that can be used remotely. As the COVID-19 pandemic persists, the program continues to require safety procedures for in-person activity and continues to generate and pilot methodologies that reduce risk and make it easier for participants to provide information.",American journal of epidemiology,2023,Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Population Health; Data Collection,False,6

Six survey versions were deployed between May 2020 and March 2021, covering mental health, loneliness, activity, substance use, and discrimination, as well as COVID-19 symptoms, testing, treatment, and vaccination. A total of 104,910 All of Us Research Program participants, of whom over 73% were from communities traditionally underrepresented in biomedical research, completed 275,201 surveys; 9,693 completed all 6 surveys. Response rates varied widely among demographic groups and were lower among participants from certain racial and ethnic minority populations, participants with low income or educational attainment, and participants with a Spanish language preference. Survey modifications improved participant response rates between the first and last surveys (13.9% to 16.1%, P < 0.001).

Including these populations in precision medicine research is critical for scientific benefits to accrue to them. We assessed representation of blind and deaf people in the All of Us Research Program (AoURP) 2018-2023 cohort of participants who provided electronic health records and compared it with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2018 national estimates by key demographic characteristics and intersections thereof. Blind and deaf AoURP participants are considerably underrepresented in the cohort, especially among working-age adults (younger than age 65 years), as well as Asian and multi-racial participants. Analyses show compounded underrepresentation at the intersection of multiple marginalization (that is, racial or ethnic minoritized group, female sex, low education and low income), most substantively for working-age blind participants identifying as Black or African American female with education levels lower than high school (representing one-fifth of their national prevalence). Underrepresentation raises concerns about the generalizability of findings in studies that use these data and limited benefits for the already underserved blind and deaf populations.",Nature medicine,2023,Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Black or African American; Ethnicity; Population Health; Racial Groups; Middle Aged; Blindness; Deafness; Health Disparate Minority and Vulnerable Populations; Asian; United States; Male; Sex Factors; Social Determinants of Health; Educational Status,False,2
All of Us,37231234,Precision medicine and the problem of structural injustice.,"Many countries currently invest in technologies and data infrastructures to foster precision medicine (PM), which is hoped to better tailor disease treatment and prevention to individual patients. But who can expect to benefit from PM? The answer depends not only on scientific developments but also on the willingness to address the problem of structural injustice. One important step is to confront the problem of underrepresentation of certain populations in PM cohorts via improved research inclusivity. Yet, we argue that the perspective needs to be broadened because the (in)equitable effects of PM are also strongly contingent on wider structural factors and prioritization of healthcare strategies and resources. When (and before) implementing PM, it is crucial to attend to how the organisation of healthcare systems influences who will benefit, as well as whether PM may present challenges for a solidaristic sharing of costs and risks. We discuss these issues through a comparative lens of healthcare models and PM-initiatives in the United States, Austria, and Denmark. The analysis draws attention to how PM hinges on-and simultaneously affects-access to healthcare services, public trust in data handling, and prioritization of healthcare resources. Finally, we provide suggestions for how to mitigate foreseeable negative effects.","Medicine, health care, and philosophy",2023,Humans; Precision Medicine; Delivery of Health Care; Austria,False,5

This article describes the protections embedded in the multistep access process, with a particular focus on how the data was transformed to meet generally accepted re-identification risk levels. At the time of the study, the resource consisted of 329 084 participants. Systematic amendments were applied to the data to mitigate re-identification risk (eg, generalization of geographic regions, suppression of public events, and randomization of dates). We computed the re-identification risk for each participant using a state-of-the-art adversarial model specifically assuming that it is known that someone is a participant in the program. We confirmed the expected risk is no greater than 0.09, a threshold that is consistent with guidelines from various US state and federal agencies. We further investigated how risk varied as a function of participant demographics. The results indicated that 95th percentile of the re-identification risk of all the participants is below current thresholds. At the same time, we observed that risk levels were higher for certain race, ethnic, and genders. While the re-identification risk was sufficiently low, this does not imply that the system is devoid of risk. Rather, All of Us uses a multipronged data protection strategy that includes strong authentication practices, active monitoring of data misuse, and penalization mechanisms for users who violate terms of service.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2023,Humans; Male; Female; Population Health; Privacy; Risk Management; Computer Security; Research Personnel,False,8

All of Us,37150941,Drug-Induced Liver Injury with Commonly Used Antibiotics in the All of Us Research Program.,"Antibiotics are a known cause of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the five most commonly prescribed antibiotics in the United States are azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, cephalexin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. We quantified the frequency of acute DILI for these common antibiotics in the All of Us Research Program, one of the largest electronic health record (EHR)-linked research cohorts in the United States. Retrospective analyses were conducted applying a standardized phenotyping algorithm to de-identified clinical data available in the All of Us database for 318,598 study participants. Between February 1984 and December 2022, more than 30% of All of Us participants (n = 119,812 individuals) had been exposed to at least 1 of our 5 study drugs. Initial screening identified 591 potential case patients that met our preselected laboratory-based phenotyping criteria. Because DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion, we then used phenome scanning to narrow the case counts by (i) scanning all EHRs to identify all alternative diagnostic explanations for the laboratory abnormalities, and (ii) leveraging International Classification of Disease 9th revision (ICD)-9 and ICD 10th revision (ICD)-10 codes as exclusion criteria to eliminate misclassification. Our final case counts were 30 DILI cases with amoxicillin-clavulanate, 24 cases with azithromycin, 24 cases with ciprofloxacin, 22 cases with amoxicillin alone, and < 20 cases with cephalexin. These findings demonstrate that data from EHR-linked research cohorts can be efficiently mined to identify DILI cases related to the use of common antibiotics.",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2023,Humans; United States; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Azithromycin; Retrospective Studies; Population Health; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Amoxicillin-Potassium Clavulanate Combination; Amoxicillin; Ciprofloxacin; Cephalexin,False,4

Few studies of AA have adequately included participants from underrepresented groups when evaluating the burden of AA in the United States. We conducted a cross-sectional study of personal/demographic factors and AA using the ongoing All of Us (AoU) Research Program. AoU enrolls adults over 18 years either as direct volunteers or through participating Health Care Provider Organizations by prioritizing recruiting underrepresented groups. We linked data from surveys and electronic health records (EHRs) to estimate the prevalence of AA by race/ethnicity, physical disability, sexual orientation/gender identity (LGBTQIA +), income, and education. The latest AoU release (version 5) includes 329,038 participants. Average age was 51.8 years (standard deviation, SD 16.7), and 60.2% of participants were female. Of these, 251,597 (76.5%) had EHR data and 752 were diagnosed with AA (prevalence, 0.30%; 95% CI 0.28-0.32). We used multivariate logistic regression adjusted for age and other factors to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prevalence of AA. Compared to Whites, Blacks and Hispanics had higher odds of AA (OR, 1.72; 95% CI 1.39-2.11 and OR, 2.13; 95% CI 1.74-2.59, respectively). Lower odds of AA were observed in participants with less than a high school degree (OR, 0.80; 95% CI 0.59-1.08), household income ≤ $35,000 (OR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.54-0.83), and no health insurance (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.20-0.56). In this diverse population of US adults, participants with skin of color had higher prevalence of AA. Lower prevalence of AA among individuals with lower education and income levels and those lacking health insurance may reflect limited access to dermatologic care and potentially higher levels of undiagnosed AA in these groups.",Archives of dermatological research..,2023,Humans; Alopecia Areata; Cross-Sectional Studies; Male; Female; Adolescent; Adult; Middle Aged; Aged; Autoimmune Diseases; Prevalence; United States,False,8

Although the coexistence of sarcoidosis and psoriasis in the same individuals has been reported, the potential association between these diseases at a population-level in the United States has not been evaluated. To evaluate this association, we performed a matched cross-sectional study in the All of Us research program database. In the multivariable analysis of 4932 psoriasis cases and 19,728 controls, sarcoidosis was found to be significantly associated with psoriasis (OR 2.37 [95% CI 1.73-3.23], p < 0.001). The relative strength of this association between psoriasis and sarcoidosis may be, in part, explained by overlapping immunopathogenesis and common genetic susceptibility of these diseases. Taken together, these observations underscore the need for screening psoriasis patients for development of new cardiopulmonary symptoms.

As a key modifiable behavioral factor, alcohol consumption patterns among cancer survivors, especially during treatment, remain underexplored in the United States. To comprehensively characterize alcohol consumption patterns among US cancer survivors. This cross-sectional study used data from May 6, 2018, to January 1, 2022, from the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program, a diverse US cohort with electronic health record (EHR) linkage, and included 15 199 participants who reported a cancer diagnosis and 1839 patients among a subset with EHR data who underwent treatment within the past year of the baseline survey. Data analysis was performed from October 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023. Prevalence of current drinking and of risky drinking behaviors, including exceeding moderate drinking (>2 drinks on a typical drinking day), binge drinking (≥6 drinks on 1 occasion), and hazardous drinking (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption [AUDIT-C] score ≥3 for women or ≥4 for men). This study included 15 199 adults (mean [SD] age at baseline, 63.1 [13.0] years; 9508 women [62.6%]) with a cancer diagnosis. Overall, 11 815 cancer survivors (77.7%) were current drinkers. Among current drinkers, 1541 (13.0%) exceeded moderate drinking, 2812 (23.8%) reported binge drinking, and 4527 (38.3%) engaged in hazardous drinking. After multivariable adjustment, survivors who were younger than 65 years, men, or of Hispanic ethnicity or who received a diagnosis before 18 years of age or ever smoked were more likely to exceed moderate drinking (aged <50 years: odds ratio [OR], 2.90 [95% CI, 2.41-3.48]; aged 50-64 years: OR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.58-2.15]; men: OR, 2.38 [95% CI, 2.09-2.72]; Hispanic ethnicity: OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.04-1.64]; aged <18 years at diagnosis: OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.04-2.24]; former smokers: OR, 2.46 [95% CI, 2.16-2.79]; current smokers: OR, 4.14 [95% CI, 3.40-5.04]) or binge drink (aged <50 years: OR, 4.46 [95% CI, 3.85-5.15]; aged 50-64 years: OR, 2.15 [95% CI, 1.90-2.43]; men: OR, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.89-2.34]; Hispanic ethnicity: OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.09-1.58]; aged <18 years at diagnosis: OR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.24-2.35]; former smokers: OR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.53-1.87]; current smokers: OR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.91-2.71]). Survivors with cancer diagnosed before 18 years of age or who ever smoked were more likely to be hazardous drinkers (aged <18 years at diagnosis: OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.11-2.08]; former smokers: OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.68-1.99]; current smokers: OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.79-2.53]).

Missing survey responses pose challenges to study conclusions. We describe missingness in All of Us baseline surveys. We extracted survey responses between May 31, 2017, to September 30, 2020. Missing percentages for groups historically underrepresented in biomedical research were compared to represented groups. Associations of missing percentages with age, health literacy score, and survey completion date were evaluated. We used negative binomial regression to evaluate participant characteristics on the number of missed questions out of the total eligible questions for each participant. The dataset analyzed contained data for 334,183 participants who submitted at least one baseline survey. Almost all (97.0%) of the participants completed all baseline surveys, and only 541 (0.2%) participants skipped all questions in at least one of the baseline surveys. The median skip rate was 5.0% of the questions, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 2.5% to 7.9%. Historically underrepresented groups were associated with higher missingness (incidence rate ratio (IRR) [95% CI]: 1.26 [1.25, 1.27] for Black/African American compared to White). Missing percentages were similar by survey completion date, participant age, and health literacy score. Skipping specific questions were associated with higher missingness (IRRs [95% CI]: 1.39 [1.38, 1.40] for skipping income, 1.92 [1.89, 1.95] for skipping education, 2.19 [2.09-2.30] for skipping sexual and gender questions).

All of Us,37802041,The need for an intersectionality framework in precision medicine research.,"Precision medicine research has seen growing efforts to increase participation of communities that have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research. Marginalized racial and ethnic communities have received particular attention, toward the goal of improving the generalizability of scientific knowledge and promoting health equity. Against this backdrop, research has highlighted three key issues that could impede the promise of precision medicine research: issues surrounding (dis)trust and representation, challenges in translational efforts to improve health outcomes, and the need for responsive community engagement. Existing efforts to address these challenges have predominantly centered on single-dimensional demographic criteria such as race, ethnicity, or sex, while overlooking how these and additional variables, such as disability, gender identity, and socioeconomic factors, can confound and jointly impact research participation. We argue that increasing cohort diversity and the responsiveness of precision medicine research studies to community needs requires an approach that transcends conventional boundaries and embraces a more nuanced, multi-layered, and intersectional framework for data collection, analyses, and implementation. We draw attention to gaps in existing work, highlight how overlapping layers of marginalization might shape and substantiate one another and affect the precision-medicine research cycle, and put forth strategies to facilitate equitable advantages from precision-medicine research to diverse participants and internally heterogeneous communities.",American journal of human genetics,2023,Humans; Male; Female; Intersectional Framework; Precision Medicine; Gender Identity; Ethnicity; Biomedical Research,False,2

Cross-sectional study. All subjects were participants in the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program. This study cohort consists of participants who were diagnosed with glaucoma and who answered the question on the Health Care Access and Utilization Survey regarding whether they have seen an eye care provider in the last 12 months. Descriptive analyses were conducted based on participant age, gender, race/ethnicity, insurance status, level of education, and income bracket. Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for these factors was used to generate odds ratios (ORs) for the association between socioeconomic factors and visit adherence. Visit adherence, defined as reporting seeing an eye care provider in the last 12 months. Among 4517 patients with glaucoma, 730 (16.3%) indicated that they had not seen or spoken to an eye doctor in the last 12 months. In multivariable models, those with some college education (OR: 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-3.04) and those with a college degree or advanced degree (OR: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.39-3.60) and those with the highest annual income of ≥ $200 000 (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.10-2.45) were more likely to have seen an eye doctor in the past year compared with those in the lowest education and income categories, respectively. Lower income and education levels were significantly associated with lower odds of seeing an eye doctor in the past year among all patients with glaucoma in All of Us. This highlights an important health disparity and may inform subsequent interventions to promote improved adherence to clinical guidelines regarding eye care for glaucoma monitoring and management.

In addition, we assessed the performance of the model for two subgroups (high and moderately consistent wearable device users). Study variables were derived from the electronic health records, questionnaires, and wearable devices of a cohort of individuals with one of 8 surgery types and that were part of the NIH All of Us research program. Through multivariable analysis, high frailty index (OR 1.69, 95% 1.05-7.22, p<0.006), and older age (OR 1.76, 95% 1.55-4.08, p<0.024) were found to be the driving risk factors of poor recovery post-surgery. Our logistic regression model included 15 variables, 5 of which included wearable device data. In wearable use subgroups, the model had better accuracy for high wearable users (81%). Findings demonstrate the potential for models that use wearable measures to assess frailty to inform clinicians of patients at risk for poor surgical outcomes.

Increasing evidence suggests some mechanistic overlap in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis and some cases of asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR), but the potential association between psoriasis and asthma and AR has not been thoroughly investigated. The study aimed to investigate the association between psoriasis and asthma and AR. We used data from the NIH All of US Research Program, a nationwide longitudinal cohort of US adults, collected from 2018 to present. The source population comprised a demographically and socioeconomically diverse cohort of over 300,000 Americans. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine the association between psoriasis and asthma and AR, after adjusting for sociodemographic variables, body mass index, and smoking status. In total, 235,551 participants (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [16.6] years; 59.3% female), including 5165 individuals with psoriasis and 230,386 individuals without psoriasis, were included in our analysis. Participants with psoriasis had significantly higher prevalence of asthma (26.1% vs. 12.9%; P < 0.001) and AR (31.8% vs. 13.4%; P < 0.001) compared to participants without psoriasis. Psoriasis was significantly associated with both asthma [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.08-2.37] and AR (aOR, 2.57; 95% CI 2.42-2.73).

Investigating epidemiological and clinical parameters can contribute to an improved understanding of disease development and management. In this cross-sectional, case-control study, we used the All of Us database to compare healthcare access, family history, smoking-related behaviors, and psychiatric comorbidities in light smoking controls, matched smoking controls, and primary and secondary lung cancer patients. We found a decreased odds of primary lung cancer patients versus matched smoking controls reporting inability to afford follow-up or specialist care. Additionally, we found a significantly increased odds of secondary lung cancer patients having comorbid anxiety and insomnia when compared to matched smoking controls. Our study provides a profile of the psychiatric disease burden in lung cancer patients and reports key epidemiological factors in patients with primary and secondary lung cancer. By using two controls, we were able to separate smoking behavior from lung cancer and identify factors that were mediated by heavy smoking alone or by both smoking and lung cancer.",Scientific reports,2023,Humans; United States; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Population Health; Comorbidity; Lung Neoplasms; Risk Factors,False,3

Essential to the verification of biobanks is a replication of known associations to establish validity. Here, we evaluated how well All of Us data replicated known cigarette smoking associations. We defined smoking exposure as follows: (1) an EHR Smoking exposure that used International Classification of Disease codes; (2) participant provided information (PPI) Ever Smoking; and, (3) PPI Current Smoking, both from the lifestyle survey. We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) for each smoking exposure measurement type. For each, we compared the effect sizes derived from the PheWAS to published meta-analyses that studied cigarette smoking from PubMed. We defined two levels of replication of meta-analyses: (1) nominally replicated: which required agreement of direction of effect size, and (2) fully replicated: which required overlap of confidence intervals. PheWASes with EHR Smoking, PPI Ever Smoking, and PPI Current Smoking revealed 736, 492, and 639 phenome-wide significant associations, respectively. We identified 165 meta-analyses representing 99 distinct phenotypes that could be matched to EHR phenotypes. At P < .05, 74 were nominally replicated and 55 were fully replicated. At P < 2.68 × 10-5 (Bonferroni threshold), 58 were nominally replicated and 40 were fully replicated. Most phenotypes found in published meta-analyses associated with smoking were nominally replicated in All of Us. Both survey and EHR definitions for smoking produced similar results.

To examine the associations between access to eye care, glaucoma severity, and incisional glaucoma surgery using data from the National Institute of Health AoU Research Program. Individuals with International Classification of Diseases Ninth or 10th Revision codes and who answered the survey question about eye care access in AoU were included in the study. The exposure variable was access to eye care services, with outcome variables (1) glaucoma severitys and (2) likelihood of incisional surgery. Unadjusted multinomial logistic regression compared access to eye care services and glaucoma severity. In addition, unadjusted logistic regression models compared access to eye care and the likelihood of incisional surgery. These were repeated using adjusted analyses, controlling for sex assigned at birth, race and ethnicity, and age. Compared with individuals without access to eye care services, those with access were more likely to have all levels of glaucoma severity [mild adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 5.81, 95% CI: 3.15-10.73, moderate aOR: 4.44, 95% CI: 2.45-8.02, severe aOR: 6.95, 95% CI: 2.69-17.93, and unspecified aOR: 3.06, 95% CI: 2.72, 3.45].

We examined cross-sectionally participants with SLE in the All of Us Research Program, a US cohort with a participant survey at enrollment (May 2018 to June 2022) and linked electronic health record (EHR) data. We described and compared characteristics of men and women with SLE encompassing disease manifestations and prescribed medications from EHR data and socioeconomic factors, including health literacy and health care access and utilization, from surveys. We reported racial variations stratified by sex. Of 1,462 participants with SLE, 126 (9%) were male. Men reported lower educational attainment and less fatigue than women. Myocardial infarction was significantly more common in men. Men had significantly less confidence in completing medical forms than women and exhibited a trend toward requiring more help in reading health-related materials. Barriers to health care access and utilization were common in both men and women (40% versus 47%, respectively, reporting some reason for delay in care; P = 0.35). Women of race other than Black or African American or White more often reported delaying care due to cultural differences between patient and provider. Our study demonstrated major clinical and health literacy differences in men and women with SLE. Socioeconomic factors were significant barriers to health care in both sexes. Our study suggests men have disproportionately poorer health literacy, which may exacerbate preexisting disparities.

Self-identified gender identity and sexual orientation group. Twelve health conditions were evaluated: 11 using EHR data and 1, body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), using participants' physical measurements. Logistic regression (adjusting for age, income, and employment, enrollment year, and US Census division) was used to obtain adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for the associations between each SGM group and health condition compared with a non-SGM reference group. The analytic sample included 346 868 participants (median [IQR] age, 55 [39-68] years; 30 763 [8.9%] self-identified as SGM). Among participants with available BMI (80.2%) and EHR data (69.4%), SGM groups had higher odds of anxiety, depression, HIV diagnosis, and tobacco use disorder but lower odds of cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Estimated associations for asthma (AOR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.24-0.63] for gender diverse people assigned male at birth; AOR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.38-0.69] for transgender women), a BMI of 25 or higher (AOR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.38-1.96] for transgender men), cancer (AOR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.07-1.23] for cisgender sexual minority men; AOR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.81-0.95] for cisgender sexual minority women), and substance use disorder (AOR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.24-0.52] for gender diverse people assigned female at birth; AOR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.49-0.87] for transgender men) varied substantially across SGM groups compared with non-SGM groups.

To examine odds of delaying care for any reason and, secondarily, for 7 specific reasons among TGD individuals and cisgender women compared with cisgender men in the All of Us Research Program. We calculated the odds of delayed care by gender identity relative to cisgender men using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, with adjustment for age, race, income, education, and Charlson comorbidity index. We examined 117,806 All of Us participants who completed the healthcare access and utilization survey. The primary outcome was self-reported delayed care in the past 12 months for any of 7 potential reasons: cost (out-of-pocket cost, co-payment costs, and/or high deductible), lack of childcare, lack of eldercare, nervousness associated with visiting the healthcare provider, rurality, inability to take time off work, and lack of transportation. Compared with cisgender men, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for delaying care for any reason was 1.48 (95% CI, 1.44-1.53; P < 0.001) among cisgender women, 1.65 (95% CI, 1.24-2.21; P < 0.001) among TGD individuals assigned male at birth, and 2.76 (95% CI, 2.26-3.39; P < 0.001) among TGD individuals assigned female at birth. Results were consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses. TGD individuals were substantially more likely to cite nervousness with visiting a healthcare provider as a barrier, whereas cisgender women were more likely to delay care due to lack of childcare coverage.

Racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in health literacy and perception of health status have been described for many disease processes. However, few studies have assessed the prevalence of these disparities among spine oncology patients. Adult spine oncology patients, identified using ICD-9/10-CM codes, were categorized by race/ethnicity: White/Caucasian (WC), Black/African-American (BAA), and Non-White Hispanic (NWH). Demographics and socioeconomic status were assessed. Questionnaire responses regarding baseline health status, perception of health status, health literacy, and barriers to healthcare were compared. Of the 1,175 patients identified, 207 (17.6%) were BAA, 267 (22.7%) were NWH, and 701 (59.7%) were WC. Socioeconomic status varied among cohorts, with WC patients reporting higher levels of education ( P<0.001 ), annual income greater than $50K ( P<0.001 ), and home ownership ( P<0.001 ). BAA and NWH patients reported greater rates of 7-day ""Severe fatigue"" ( P<0.001 ) and ""10/10 pain"" ( P<0.001 ) and lower rates of ""Completely"" able to perform everyday activities ( P<0.001 ). WC patients had a higher response rate for ""Excellent/Very Good"" regarding their own general health ( P<0.001 ) and quality ( P<0.001 ). The WC cohort had a significantly higher proportion of patients responding ""Never"" when assessing difficulty understanding ( P<0.001 ) and needing assistance with health materials ( P<0.001 ). BAA and NWH were significantly less likely to report feeling ""Extremely"" confident with medical forms ( P<0.001 ). BAA and NWH had significantly higher response rates to feeling ""Somewhat Worried"" about healthcare costs ( P<0.001 ) and with delaying medical care given ""Can't Afford Co-pay"" ( P<0.001 ). We identified disparities in perception of health status, literacy, and access among spine oncology patients. 4.",Spine,2023,Adult; Humans; Literacy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Population Health; Health Status; Social Class; Health Services Accessibility; Neoplasms; Perception; Healthcare Disparities,False,4

We sought to examine disparities in PSA testing rates among groups with higher prostate cancer risk and differential access to healthcare. We identified a cohort of 37,706 males within the All of Us Research Program without a history of prostate cancer between the ages of 40 and 85 at time of enrollment (2017-2021). Incidence rate ratios (IRR) for the number of PSA tests received during follow-up through December 2021 were estimated using age- and multivariable-adjusted negative binomial regression models. PSA testing frequencies in the cohort were compared with population-based estimates from the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). A total of 6,486 males (17.2%) received at least one PSA test over the course of follow-up. In multivariable-adjusted models, non-Hispanic Black males received PSA tests at a 17% lower rate (IRR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.76, 0.90) than non-Hispanic White males. Higher educational attainment, higher annual income, having self-/employer-purchased insurance, having a spouse or domestic partner, and having a family history of prostate cancer were all associated with higher rates of PSA testing. The proportion of males ages 55 to 69 who received a PSA test within two years was lower in All of Us (12.4%, 95% CI 11.8-13.0%) relative to population-based estimates from the BRFSS (35.2%, 95% CI 34.2-36.3%). Absolute PSA testing rates in All of Us were lower than population-based estimates, but associations with PSA testing in the cohort mirrored previously reported disparities in prostate cancer screening.

Data entered from May 2018 to November 2022 was analyzed. Patient demographics such as age, gender, educational level, and insurance status were assessed. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed for statistical evaluation. A subset of 8875 patients (48.3% male, mean age 69) were evaluated. After multivariate analysis, female participants were more likely than male participants to report difficulty affording prescribed medications (odds ratio [OR]: 1.7, p < .0005) and specialists (OR: 1.4, p < 0.005). Female patients were also more likely to delay care due to elder care responsibilities (OR: 2.6, p < .0005), employment obligations (OR: 1.7, p < .0005), and feelings of apprehension in seeing a provider (OR: 1.7, p < .0005).

To characterize measures of socioeconomic status and barriers to healthcare access and utilization between patients with and without a diagnosis of glaucoma. Patients aged 65 years and over who enrolled in the NIH All of Us Research Program, a nationwide longitudinal cohort, were extracted. We analyzed demographic information and several measures of socioeconomic status and healthcare access and utilization. Survey responses were compared by glaucoma status (any type) with Pearson χ 2 tests, univariable logistic regression, and multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and insurance status. Of the 49,487 patients who answered at least 1 question on the All of Us Healthcare Access and Utilization Survey, 4441 (9.0%) had a diagnosis of glaucoma. Majority of the cohort was female (28,162, 56.9%) and nonHispanic White (42,008, 84.9%). Glaucoma patients were observed to have lower rates of education ( P =0.004), employment ( P <0.001), and home ownership ( P <0.001) on χ 2 tests.

This is a retrospective study involving data from the AoU program (R2020Q4R2, N = 315,297). Five vaccine cohorts [influenza, hepatitis B (HBV), pneumococcal <65 years old, pneumococcal ≥65 years old, and human papillomavirus (HPV)] were generated based on vaccination history. The influenza cohort comprised participants with documented influenza vaccinations in electronic health records (EHRs) from September 2017 to May 2018. Other vaccine cohorts comprised participants with ≥1 lifetime record(s) of vaccination documented in the EHR by December 2018. The vaccine cohorts were compared to the overall AoU cohort. Descriptive statistics were generated using EHR- and survey-based sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle information. The SAMBA (0.9.0) R package was utilized to adjust for EHR selection and outcome misclassification biases to infer sources of disparity for pneumococcal vaccinations in older adults. Cohort counts were as follows: influenza (n = 15,346), HBV (n = 6323), pneumococcal <65 (n = 15,217), pneumococcal ≥65 (n = 15,100), and HPV (n = 2125). All vaccine cohorts had higher proportions of White and non-Hispanic/Latino participants compared to the overall AoU cohort. The largest differences were found in pneumococcal age ≥65, with 80.2% White participants compared to 52.9% in the overall study population. Multivariable analysis revealed that race/ethnic disparities in pneumococcal vaccination among older adults were explained by biological sex, income, health insurance, and education-related variables.

However, the effect of neuropsychiatric conditions on long-term adolescent and young adult cancer (AYAC) survivors has not been formally investigated. Thus, the impact and management of late neuropsychiatric complications in AYAC survivors compared to non-cancer-matched controls (NCMC) in the US were evaluated using the All of Us (AoU) Research Program. Participants in the AoU Controlled Tier Dataset (v6) diagnosed with cancer between ages 15 and 39 were identified from electronic health records and surveys. AYAC survivors were matched with NCMC using the optimal pair-matching algorithm at a 1:4 ratio. Data on past diagnoses, current follow-up care, and treatment patterns of neuropsychiatric complications were collected. Analysis was performed on 788 AYAC survivors and 3152 NCMC. AYAC survivors, with an average of 8.8 years since their first cancer diagnosis, were more likely than NCMC to receive a diagnosis of neuropathy, memory loss and epilepsy (p  < 0.001). Survivors also had a higher rate of follow-up care and treatment utilization for these neurological conditions compared to NCMC (p  < 0.05). Treatment utilization was highest among survivors receiving care for epilepsy (88%), and lower for neuropathy (70%), memory loss (61%), and chronic fatigue (59%). This large study reveals that AYAC survivors, on average 9 years after their cancer diagnosis, require more frequent follow-up care for neurological complications compared to non-cancer individuals. However, the management of neuropathy, memory loss, and chronic fatigue is hindered by a lack of mechanism-based effective therapies.",Cancer medicine,2023,"Humans; Adolescent; Young Adult; United States; Adult; Cancer Survivors; Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic; Population Health; Neoplasms; Memory Disorders; Epilepsy",False,8

Most of the phenotype definitions include narrative descriptions and flowcharts, while few provide pseudocode or executable artifacts. Most use 4 or fewer medical terminologies. The number of codes used ranges from 5 to 6865, and value sets from 1 to 19. We found that the most common expressions used were literal, data, and logical expressions. Aggregate and arithmetic expressions are the least common. Expression depth ranges from 4 to 27. Despite the range of conditions, we found that all of the phenotype definitions consisted of logical criteria, representing both clinical and operational logic, and tabular data, consisting of codes from standard terminologies and keywords for natural language processing. The total number and variety of expressions are low, which may be to simplify implementation, or authors may limit complexity due to data availability constraints.

The objective of the current study was to predict MACE among T2DM patients. Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients above 18 years old were recruited for the study from the All of Us Research Program. Eligible participants were those who took sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. Different Machine learning algorithms: including RandomForest (RF), XGBoost, logistic regression (LR), and weighted ensemble model (WEM) were employed. Clinical attributes, electrolytes and biomarkers were explored in predicting MACE. The feature importance was determined using mean decrease accuracy. Overall, 9, 059 subjects were included in the analyses, of which 5197 (57.4%) were females. The XGBoost Model demonstrated a prediction accuracy of 0.80 [0.78-0.82], which is higher as compared to the RF 0.78[0.76-0.80], the LR model 0.65 [0.62-0.67], and the WEM 0.75 [0.73-0.76], respectively. The classification accuracy of the models for stroke was more than 95%, which was higher than prediction accuracy for MI (∼85%), and HF (∼80%). Phosphate, blood urea nitrogen and troponin levels were the major predictors of MACE. The ML models had shown acceptable performance in predicting MACE in T2DM patients, except the LR model. Phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, and other electrolytes were important predictors of MACE, which is consistent between the individual components of MACE, such as stroke, MI, and HF.

However, many factors may be barriers to regular screening and associated with disparities in screening rates. To evaluate the associations between visiting an eye care practitioner for diabetic retinopathy screening and factors related to overall health and social determinants of health, including socioeconomic status and health care access and utilization. This retrospective cross-sectional study included adults aged 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes who answered survey questions in the All of Us Research Program, a national multicenter cohort of patients contributing electronic health records and survey data, who were enrolled from May 1, 2018, to July 1, 2022. The associations between visiting an eye care practitioner and (1) demographic and socioeconomic factors and (2) responses to the Health Care Access and Utilization, Social Determinants of Health, and Overall Health surveys were investigated using univariable and multivariable logistic regressions. The primary outcome was whether patients self-reported visiting an eye care practitioner in the past 12 months. The associations between visiting an eye care practitioner and demographic and socioeconomic factors and responses to the Health Care Access and Utilization, Social Determinants of Health, and Overall Health surveys in All of Us were investigated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Of the 11 551 included participants (54.55% cisgender women; mean [SD] age, 64.71 [11.82] years), 7983 (69.11%) self-reported visiting an eye care practitioner in the past year. Individuals who thought practitioner concordance was somewhat or very important were less likely to have seen an eye care practitioner (somewhat important: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.93]; very important: AOR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.76-0.95]). Compared with financially stable participants, individuals with food or housing insecurity were less likely to visit an eye care practitioner (food insecurity: AOR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.61-0.91]; housing insecurity: AOR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75-0.98]). Individuals who reported fair mental health were less likely to visit an eye care practitioner than were those who reported good mental health (AOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.96).

We aimed to estimate HIV incidence in a multisite cohort of transgender women in the eastern and southern USA. Participant deaths were identified during follow-up; thus, we felt it was an ethical imperative to report mortality alongside HIV incidence. In this study, we established a multisite cohort across two modes: a site-based, technology-enhanced mode in six cities (Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Miami, New York City, and Washington, DC) and an exclusively digital mode that spanned 72 eastern and southern US cities that matched the six site-based cities based on population size and demographics. Trans feminine adults (≥18 years) who were not living with HIV were eligible and followed up for at least 24 months. Participants completed surveys and oral fluid HIV testing with clinical confirmation. We ascertained deaths through community and clinical sources. We estimated HIV incidence and mortality using the number of HIV seroconversions and deaths, respectively, divided by person-years accumulated from enrolment. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of HIV seroconversion (primary outcome) or death. Between March 22, 2018, and Aug 31, 2020, we enrolled 1312 participants with 734 (56%) in site-based and 578 (44%) in digital modes. At the 24-month assessment, 633 (59%) of 1076 eligible participants consented to extending participation. 1084 (83%) of 1312 participants were retained at this analysis based on the study definition of loss to follow-up. As of May 25, 2022, the cohort participants had contributed 2730 accumulated person-years to the analytical dataset. Overall HIV incidence was 5·5 (95% CI 2·7-8·3) per 1000 person-years and incidence was higher among Black participants and those living in the south. Nine participants died during the study. The overall mortality rate was 3·3 (95% CI 1·5-6·3) per 1000 person-years, and the rate was higher among Latinx participants. Identical predictors of HIV seroconversion and death included residence in southern cities, sexual partnerships with cisgender men, and use of stimulants. Participation in the digital cohort and seeking care for gender transition were inversely associated with both outcomes. As HIV research and interventions are increasingly delivered online, differences by mode highlight the need for continued community and location-based efforts to reach the most marginalised transgender women. Our findings underscore community calls for interventions that address social and structural contexts that affect survival and other health concerns alongside HIV prevention.

Surveys were recurring and answered from May 2020 to February 2021. Demographics and the most recently answered survey responses were obtained and stratified by glaucoma status. Pearson's Chi-squared tests and multivariable logistic regressions adjusting for age, gender, race, ethnicity, and income were used to generate p-values, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between outcome measures and glaucoma status. Of 42,484 patients who responded to All of Us COPE survey items, 2912 (6.9%) had a diagnosis of glaucoma. On Pearson's Chi-squared tests glaucoma patients were less likely to report drinking alcohol (P = 0.003), eating more food than usual (P = 0.004), and using marijuana (P = 0.006) to cope with social distancing than those without a diagnosis of glaucoma. Further, glaucoma patients had lower rates of probable mild, moderate, or severe depression as calculated by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores (P < 0.001) and had lower rates of reporting some or a lot of stress from social distancing (P < 0.001). However, glaucoma patients were less likely to report having someone to help prepare meals (P = 0.005) or help with daily chores (P = 0.003) if they became sick with COVID-19. In multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for confounding factors, no differences were found for measures of mental health or social support. Glaucoma patients did not fare worse on many measures of mental health and coping strategies during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic compared those without glaucoma. However, a substantial proportion of glaucoma patients still endorsed stress, social isolation, and probable depression, representing challenges for disease management.",BMC ophthalmology,2023,Humans; Adult; Middle Aged; COVID-19; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Pandemics; Depression; Anxiety; Population Health; Glaucoma; Social Support,False,6

In novel subspecialties, it requires that clinicians refer patients to genetic evaluation or testing, however referral is likely to be affected by genetic knowledge. An online survey was administered to self-identified nephrologists working in the United States. Nephrologists' demographic characteristics, genetic education, confidence in clinical genetics, genetic knowledge, and referral rates of patients to genetic evaluation were collected. In total, 201 nephrologists completed the survey. All reported treating patients with genetic forms of kidney disease, and 37% had referred <5 patients to genetic evaluation. A third had limited basic genetic knowledge. Most nephrologists (85%) reported concerns regarding future health insurance eligibility as a barrier to referral to genetic testing. Most adult nephrologists reported insufficient genetic education during residency (65%) and fellowship training (52%). Lower rating of genetic education and lower knowledge in recognizing signs of genetic kidney diseases were significantly associated with lower number of patients referred to the genetic evaluation (P < .001). Most nephrologists reported that improving their genetic knowledge is important for them (>55%).

All of Us,35576481,An antiplatelet response gene expression signature is associated with bleeding.,"Gene expression biosignatures may hold promise to individualize antiplatelet therapy in conjunction with current guidelines and risk scores. The Aspirin Response Signature (ARS) score is comprised of a weighted sum of correlated, pro-thrombotic gene transcripts measured in whole blood. In prior work where volunteers were exposed to aspirin 325 mg daily, higher ARS score was associated with lower platelet function; separately, in a clinical cohort of patients, higher ARS scores were associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. To better understand this apparent paradox, we measured ARS gene expression and score in volunteers to determine aspirin dose-response and ticagrelor relationships with ARS score and separately in patients to assess whether ARS is associated with incident bleeding. Blood samples were collected from volunteers (N = 188) who were exposed to 4 weeks of daily aspirin 81 mg, daily aspirin 325 mg, and/or twice-daily ticagrelor 90 mg. ARS scores were calculated from whole blood RNA qPCR, and platelet function and protein expression were assessed in platelet-rich plasma. In mixed linear regression models, aspirin 81 mg exposure was not associated with changes in ARS gene expression or score. Aspirin 325 mg exposure resulted in a 6.0% increase in ARS gene expression (P = 7.5 × 10-9 vs. baseline, P = 2.1 × 10-4 vs. aspirin 81 mg) and an increase in expression of platelet proteins corresponding to ARS genes. Ticagrelor exposure resulted in a 30.7% increase in ARS gene expression (P < 1 × 10-10 vs. baseline and each aspirin dose) and ARS score (P = 7.0 × 10-7 vs. baseline, P = 3.6 × 10-6 and 5.59 × 10-4 vs. aspirin 81 and 325 mg, respectively). Increases in ARS gene expression or score were associated with the magnitude of platelet inhibition across agents. To assess the association between ARS scores and incident bleeding, ARS scores were calculated in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization (N = 1421), of whom 25.4% experienced bleeding events over a median 6.2 years of follow-up. In a Cox model adjusting for demographics and baseline antithrombotic medication use, patients with ARS scores above the median had a higher risk of incident bleeding [hazard ratio 1.26 (95% CI 1.01-1.56), P = 0.038]. The ARS is an Antiplatelet Response Signature that increases in response to greater platelet inhibition due to antiplatelet therapy and may represent a homeostatic mechanism to prevent bleeding.

Logistic regression was used to study the association between barriers to care and race/ethnicity. Our cohort included 885 DR patients who answered the Healthcare Access & Utilization survey and 385 DR patients who responded to the SDoH survey. After adjusting for confounders, Hispanic individuals were more likely than non-Hispanic White individuals to report delaying getting medical care due to not being able to get child care (odds ratio [OR] = 6.57 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.67-27.8]). Furthermore, compared to non-Hispanic White individuals, non-Hispanic Black individuals were significantly more likely to report being treated with less respect (OR = 2.62 [95% CI, 1.15-5.80]), treated with less courtesy (OR = 2.51 [95% CI, 1.01-5.92]), and receive poorer service than other people (OR = 2.85 [95% CI, 1.25-6.34]) when they go to a doctor's office or other healthcare provider. We found that Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black individuals with DR reported greater delays/barriers to care compared to non-Hispanic White individuals even after controlling for individualized socioeconomic factors.

The AoU program, beginning in 05/2018, continues to recruit ≥ 18 years old individuals across the United States. Participants completed surveys and consented to contribute electronic health record (EHR) for research. Using the EHR, we determined participants who were exposed to SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, vortioxetine). Features (n = 88) were selected with clinicians' input and comprised sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidities, and medication use information. We identified bleeding events with validated EHR algorithms and applied logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boost to predict bleeding during SSRI exposure. We assessed model performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistic (AUC) and defined clinically significant features as resulting in > 0.01 decline in AUC after removal from the model, in three of four ML models. There were 10,362 participants exposed to SSRIs, with 9.6% experiencing a bleeding event during SSRI exposure. For each SSRI, performance across all four ML models was relatively consistent. AUCs from the best models ranged 0.632-0.698. Clinically significant features included health literacy for escitalopram, and bleeding history and socioeconomic status for all SSRIs.

All of Us,36540959,Session Introduction: Digital health technology data in biocomputing: Research efforts and considerations for expanding access.,"Data from digital health technologies (DHT), including wearable sensors like Apple Watch, Whoop, Oura Ring, and Fitbit, are increasingly being used in biomedical research. Research and development of DHT-related devices, platforms, and applications is happening rapidly and with significant private-sector involvement with new biotech companies and large tech companies (e.g. Google, Apple, Amazon, Uber) investing heavily in technologies to improve human health. Many academic institutions are building capabilities related to DHT research, often in cross-sector collaboration with technology companies and other organizations with the goal of generating clinically meaningful evidence to improve patient care, to identify users at an earlier stage of disease presentation, and to support health preservation and disease prevention. Large research consortia, cross-sector partnerships, and individual research labs are all represented in the current corpus of published studies. Some of the large research studies, like NIH's All of Us Research Program, make data sets from wearable sensors available to the research community, while the vast majority of data from wearable sensors and other DHTs are held by private sector organizations and are not readily available to the research community. As data are unlocked from the private sector and made available to the academic research community, there is an opportunity to develop innovative analytics and methods through expanded access. This Session solicited research results leveraging digital health technologies, including wearable sensor data, describing novel analytical methods, and issues related to diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI) of both the underlying research data sets and the community of researchers working in this area.

To compare the prevalence of cost and noncost barriers to care among SGM and non-SGM patients with CISDs and to analyze the prevalence of barriers based on SGM status and race and ethnicity. A cross-sectional study of health care access and utilization survey data collected by the National Institutes of Health's All of Us Research Program between May 31, 2017, and July 1, 2022, was conducted. Participants were adults aged 18 years or older with CISDs who enrolled in All of Us directly online or through partner health care practitioner organizations located across the US. Chronic inflammatory skin diseases, sexual orientation and gender identity, and race and ethnicity. The main outcome was the experience of cost and noncost barriers to health care among SGM patients with CISDs. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association of SGM status with experiencing barriers to care. This study included 19 743 patients with CISDs; 1877 were SGM patients (median age, 40.5 years [IQR, 28.7-57.9 years]; 1205 [64.2%] assigned female sex at birth) and 17 866 were non-SGM patients (median age, 57.1 years [IQR, 40.8-68.1 years]; 13 205 [73.9%] assigned female sex at birth). Compared with non-SGM patients, SGM patients with CISDs were significantly more likely to delay specialist care (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.03-1.47), mental health care (AOR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.37-1.91), and filling a prescription (AOR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52) because of cost. In addition, SGM patients with CISDs were significantly more likely than non-SGM patients to delay care because of transportation issues (AOR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.22-1.80) and not having a health care practitioner who shares the same background with regard to race and ethnicity, religion, native language, sexual orientation, and gender identity (AOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.19-1.62).

The aim was to identify ticagrelor-responsive platelet transcripts as biomarkers of platelet function and cardiovascular risk. Healthy volunteers (n=58, discovery; n=49, validation) were exposed to 4 weeks of ticagrelor with platelet RNA data, platelet function, and self-reported bleeding measured pre-/post-ticagrelor. RNA sequencing was used to discover platelet genes affected by ticagrelor, and a subset of the most informative was summarized into a composite score and tested for validation. This score was further analyzed (1) in CD34+ megakaryocytes exposed to an P2Y12 inhibitor in vitro, (2) with baseline platelet function in healthy controls, (3) in peripheral artery disease patients (n=139) versus patient controls (n=30) without atherosclerosis, and (4) in patients with peripheral artery disease for correlation with atherosclerosis severity and risk of incident major adverse cardiovascular and limb events. Ticagrelor exposure differentially expressed 3409 platelet transcripts. Of these, 111 were prioritized to calculate a Ticagrelor Exposure Signature score, which ticagrelor reproducibly increased in discovery and validation cohorts. Ticagrelor's effects on platelets transcripts positively correlated with effects of P2Y12 inhibition in primary megakaryocytes. In healthy controls, higher baseline scores correlated with lower baseline platelet function and with minor bleeding while receiving ticagrelor. In patients, lower scores independently associated with both the presence and extent of atherosclerosis and incident ischemic events.

We sought to compare the risk of liver transplantation associated with hepatitis C infection with AATD heterozygotes and homozygotes and determine if SERPINA1 sequencing would identify undiagnosed AATD. We performed a retrospective cohort study in a deidentified Electronic Health Record (EHR)-linked DNA biobank with 72,027 individuals genotyped for the M, Z, and S alleles in SERPINA1. We investigated liver transplantation frequency by genotype group and compared with hepatitis C infection. We performed SERPINA1 sequencing in carriers of pathogenic AATD alleles who underwent liver transplantation. Liver transplantation was associated with the Z allele (ZZ: odds ratio [OR] = 1.31, p<2e-16; MZ: OR = 1.02, p = 1.2e-13) and with hepatitis C (OR = 1.20, p<2e-16).

In adjusted analyses, PWH were at increased risk compared with PWoH for any hospitalization (aRR, 1.31 [95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.44]), COVID-19 hospitalizations (1.29 [1.15-1.45]), and mechanical ventilation or death (1.51 [1.19-1.92]). Prior tenofovir use was associated with reduced hospitalizations among PWH (aRR, 0.85 [95% confidence interval, .73-.99]) and PWoH (0.71 [.62-.81]). Before COVID-19 vaccine availability, PWH were at greater risk for severe outcomes than PWoH.

All of Us,37096581,Phenotype Risk Score but Not Genetic Risk Score Aids in Identifying Individuals With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in the Electronic Health Record.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) poses diagnostic challenges. We undertook this study to evaluate the utility of a phenotype risk score (PheRS) and a genetic risk score (GRS) to identify SLE individuals in a real-world setting. Using a de-identified electronic health record (EHR) database with an associated DNA biobank, we identified 789 SLE cases and 2,261 controls with available MEGA SLE cases had a significantly higher PheRS (mean ± SD 7.7 ± 8.0 versus 0.8 ± 2.0 in controls; P < 0.001) and GRS (mean ± SD 12.2 ± 2.3 versus 11.0 ± 2.0 in controls; P < 0.001). Black individuals with SLE had a higher PheRS compared to White individuals (mean ± SD 10.0 ± 10.1 versus 7.1 ± 7.2, respectively; P = 0.002) but a lower GRS (mean ± SD 9.0 ± 1.4 versus 12.3 ± 1.7, respectively; P < 0.001). Models predicting SLE that used only the PheRS had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87. Adding the GRS to the PheRS resulted in a minimal difference with an AUC of 0.89. On chart review, controls with the highest PheRS and GRS had undiagnosed SLE. We developed a SLE PheRS to identify established and undiagnosed SLE individuals. A SLE GRS using known risk SNPs did not add value beyond the PheRS and was of limited utility in Black individuals with SLE. More work is needed to understand the genetic risks of SLE in diverse populations.","Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",2023,"Humans; Electronic Health Records; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Risk Factors; Phenotype; White",False,0

We evaluated the effects of hypothetical clinic-based interventions on this mortality gap. We computed 3-year mortality under observed treatment patterns among >40 000 Black and >30 000 White adults entering HIV care in the United States from 1996 to 2019. We then used inverse probability weights to impose hypothetical interventions, including immediate treatment and guideline-based follow-up. We considered 2 scenarios: ""universal"" delivery of interventions to all patients and ""focused"" delivery of interventions to Black patients while White patients continued to follow observed treatment patterns. Under observed treatment patterns, 3-year mortality was 8% among White patients and 9% among Black patients, for a difference of 1 percentage point (95% confidence interval [CI], .5-1.4). The difference was reduced to 0.5% under universal immediate treatment (95% CI, -.4% to 1.3%) and to 0.2% under universal immediate treatment combined with guideline-based follow-up (95% CI, -1.0% to 1.4%). Under the focused delivery of both interventions to Black patients, the Black-White difference in 3-year mortality was -1.4% (95% CI, -2.3% to -.4%). Clinical interventions, particularly those focused on enhancing the care of Black patients, could have significantly reduced the mortality gap between Black and White patients entering HIV care from 1996 to 2019.",The Journal of infectious diseases,2023,Adult; Humans; HIV; HIV Infections; Race Factors; United States; White; Black or African American; Healthcare Disparities,False,2

This lack of diversity leads to disparities that can have scientific and clinical consequences. Achieving health equity related to genomics will require greater effort in addressing inequities within the field. As part of the commitment of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to advancing health equity, it convened experts in genomics and health equity research to make recommendations and performed a review of current literature to identify the landscape of gaps and opportunities at the interface between human genomics and health equity research.

Previous studies have relied on cross-sectional and self-reported survey data or polysomnograms, which have limitations with respect to data granularity, sample size and longitudinal information. Here, using objectively measured, longitudinal sleep data from commercial wearable devices linked to electronic health record data from the All of Us Research Program, we show that sleep patterns, including sleep stages, duration and regularity, are associated with chronic disease incidence. Of the 6,785 participants included in this study, 71% were female, 84% self-identified as white and 71% had a college degree; the median age was 50.2 years (interquartile range = 35.7, 61.5) and the median sleep monitoring period was 4.5 years (2.5, 6.5). We found that rapid eye movement sleep and deep sleep were inversely associated with the odds of incident atrial fibrillation and that increased sleep irregularity was associated with increased odds of incident obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, J-shaped associations were observed between average daily sleep duration and hypertension, major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. These findings show that sleep stages, duration and regularity are all important factors associated with chronic disease development and may inform evidence-based recommendations on healthy sleeping habits.",Nature medicine,2024,Humans; Female; Wearable Electronic Devices; Middle Aged; Male; Chronic Disease; Adult; Sleep; United States; Polysomnography; Risk Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Aged,False,8

PDAC cells overexpress wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) that can enable them to overcome metabolic stress, suggesting it could represent a therapeutic target in PDAC. Here, we found that anti-IDH1 therapy enhanced the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutics. Chemotherapy treatment induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased tricarboxylic acid cycle activity in PDAC cells, along with the induction of wild-type IDH1 expression as a key resistance factor. IDH1 facilitated PDAC survival following chemotherapy treatment by supporting mitochondrial function and antioxidant defense to neutralize ROS through the generation of α-ketoglutarate and NADPH, respectively. Pharmacologic inhibition of wild-type IDH1 with ivosidenib synergized with conventional chemotherapeutics in vitro and potentiated the efficacy of subtherapeutic doses of these drugs in vivo in murine PDAC models. This promising treatment approach is translatable through available and safe oral inhibitors and provides the basis of an open and accruing clinical trial testing this combination (NCT05209074). Significance: Targeting IDH1 improves sensitivity to chemotherapy by suppressing mitochondrial function and inducing oxidative stress, supporting the potential of the combination as an effective strategy for treating pancreatic cancer.",Cancer research,2024,"Animals; Female; Humans; Mice; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; Cell Line, Tumor; Citric Acid Cycle; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Drug Synergism; Gemcitabine; Glycine; Isocitrate Dehydrogenase; Mitochondria; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pyridines; Reactive Oxygen Species; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",False,0

Genetic variants in DPYD have been associated with altered enzyme activity, therefore accurate detection and interpretation is critical to predict metabolizer status for individualized fluoropyrimidine therapy. The most commonly observed deleterious variation is the causal variant linked to the previously described HapB3 haplotype, c.1129-5923C>G (rs75017182) in intron 10, which introduces a cryptic splice site. A benign synonymous variant in exon 11, c.1236G>A (rs56038477) is also linked to HapB3 and is commonly used for testing. Previously, these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported to be in perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD); therefore, c.1236G>A is often utilized as a proxy for the function-altering intronic variant. Clinical genotyping of DPYD identified a patient who had c.1236G>A, but not c.1129-5923C>G, suggesting that these two SNPs may not be in perfect LD, as previously assumed. Additional individuals with c.1236G>A, but not c.1129-5923C>G, were identified in the Children's Mercy Data Warehouse and the All of Us Research Program version 7 cohort substantiating incomplete SNP linkage. Consequently, testing only c.1236G>A can generate false-positive results in some cases and lead to suboptimal dosing that may negatively impact patient therapy and prospect of survival. Our data show that DPYD genotyping should include the functional variant c.1129-5923C>G, and not the c.1236G>A proxy, to accurately predict DPD activity.",Clinical and translational science,2024,"Child; Humans; Dihydrouracil Dehydrogenase (NADP); Haplotypes; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic; Pharmacogenomic Testing; Population Health; Genotype",False,9

To address these challenges, the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network has developed a framework and pipeline for return of a PRS-based genome-informed risk assessment to 25,000 diverse adults and children as part of a clinical study. From an initial list of 23 conditions, ten were selected for implementation based on PRS performance, medical actionability and potential clinical utility, including cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. Standardized metrics were considered in the selection process, with additional consideration given to strength of evidence in African and Hispanic populations. We then developed a pipeline for clinical PRS implementation (score transfer to a clinical laboratory, validation and verification of score performance), and used genetic ancestry to calibrate PRS mean and variance, utilizing genetically diverse data from 13,475 participants of the All of Us Research Program cohort to train and test model parameters. Finally, we created a framework for regulatory compliance and developed a PRS clinical report for return to providers and for inclusion in an additional genome-informed risk assessment.

The All of Us Research Program seeks to enroll 1 million diverse participants who share multiple sources of data, providing unique opportunities for research. It is important to understand the phenomic profiles of its participants to conduct research in this cohort. More than 280 000 participants have shared their electronic health records (EHRs) in the All of Us Research Program. We aim to understand the phenomic profiles of this cohort through comparisons with those in the US general population and a well-established nation-wide cohort, UK Biobank, and to test whether association results of selected commonly studied diseases in the All of Us cohort were comparable to those in UK Biobank. We included participants with EHRs in All of Us and participants with health records from UK Biobank. The estimates of prevalence of diseases in the US general population were obtained from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) study. We conducted phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) of 9 commonly studied diseases in both cohorts. This study included 287 012 participants from the All of Us EHR cohort and 502 477 participants from the UK Biobank. A total of 314 diseases curated by the GBD were evaluated in All of Us, 80.9% (N = 254) of which were more common in All of Us than in the US general population [prevalence ratio (PR) >1.1, P < 2 × 10-5]. Among 2515 diseases and phenotypes evaluated in both All of Us and UK Biobank, 85.6% (N = 2152) were more common in All of Us (PR >1.1, P < 2 × 10-5).

Hyperlipidemia, glaucoma status, and statin use were defined by diagnoses and medication information in EHR data collected by AoU. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between statin use and glaucoma likelihood. Logistic regression modeling was used to examine associations between glaucoma and all covariates included in adjusted analysis. Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was used to assess hyperlipidemia severity. Analyses stratified by LDL-C level and age were performed. Any glaucoma as defined by International Classification of Diseases codes found in EHR data. Of 79 742 individuals with hyperlipidemia in AoU, there were 6365 (8.0%) statin users. Statin use was associated with increased glaucoma prevalence when compared with statin nonuse (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.26). Higher serum levels of LDL-C were associated with increased odds of glaucoma (aOR: 1.003, 95% CI: 1.003, 1.004). Statin users had significantly higher LDL-C levels compared to nonusers (144.9 mg/dL versus 136.3 mg/dL, P value < 0.001). Analysis stratified by LDL-C identified positive associations between statin use and prevalence of glaucoma among those with optimal (aOR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.05-1.82) and high (aOR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.09-1.70) LDL-C levels. Age-stratified analysis showed a positive association between statin use and prevalence of glaucoma in individuals aged 60 to 69 years (aOR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.05-1.56). Statin use was associated with increased glaucoma likelihood in the overall adult AoU population with hyperlipidemia, in individuals with optimal or high LDL-C levels, and in individuals 60 to 69 years old.

This longitudinal cohort study aims to advance research by providing a rich resource of genetic and phenotypic information, enabling powerful studies on the epidemiology and genetics of human diseases. One critical challenge to maximizing its use is the development of accurate algorithms that can efficiently and accurately identify well-defined disease and disease-free participants for case-control studies. This study aimed to develop and validate type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) algorithms in the AoU cohort, using electronic health record (EHR) and survey data. Building on existing algorithms and using diagnosis codes, medications, laboratory results, and survey data, we developed and implemented algorithms for identifying prevalent cases of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The first set of algorithms used only EHR data (EHR-only), and the second set used a combination of EHR and survey data (EHR+). A universal algorithm was also developed to identify individuals without diabetes.

All of Us,38374434,The frequency of pathogenic variation in the All of Us cohort reveals ancestry-driven disparities.,"Disparities in data underlying clinical genomic interpretation is an acknowledged problem, but there is a paucity of data demonstrating it. The All of Us Research Program is collecting data including whole-genome sequences, health records, and surveys for at least a million participants with diverse ancestry and access to healthcare, representing one of the largest biomedical research repositories of its kind. Here, we examine pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants that were identified in the All of Us cohort. The European ancestry subgroup showed the highest overall rate of pathogenic variation, with 2.26% of participants having a pathogenic variant. Other ancestry groups had lower rates of pathogenic variation, including 1.62% for the African ancestry group and 1.32% in the Latino/Admixed American ancestry group. Pathogenic variants were most frequently observed in genes related to Breast/Ovarian Cancer or Hypercholesterolemia. Variant frequencies in many genes were consistent with the data from the public gnomAD database, with some notable exceptions resolved using gnomAD subsets. Differences in pathogenic variant frequency observed between ancestral groups generally indicate biases of ascertainment of knowledge about those variants, but some deviations may be indicative of differences in disease prevalence.

All of Us,39058572,Multi-modality risk prediction of cardiovascular diseases for breast cancer cohort in the All of Us Research Program.,"This study leverages the rich diversity of the All of Us Research Program (All of Us)'s dataset to devise a predictive model for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in breast cancer (BC) survivors. Central to this endeavor is the creation of a robust data integration pipeline that synthesizes electronic health records (EHRs), patient surveys, and genomic data, while upholding fairness across demographic variables. We have developed a universal data wrangling pipeline to process and merge heterogeneous data sources of the All of Us dataset, address missingness and variance in data, and align disparate data modalities into a coherent framework for analysis. Utilizing a composite feature set including EHR, lifestyle, and social determinants of health (SDoH) data, we then employed Adaptive Lasso and Random Forest regression models to predict 6 CVD outcomes. The models were evaluated using the c-index and time-dependent Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve over a 10-year period. The Adaptive Lasso model showed consistent performance across most CVD outcomes, while the Random Forest model excelled particularly in predicting outcomes like transient ischemic attack when incorporating the full multi-model feature set. Feature importance analysis revealed age and previous coronary events as dominant predictors across CVD outcomes, with SDoH clustering labels highlighting the nuanced impact of social factors. The development of both Cox-based predictive model and Random Forest Regression model represents the extensive application of the All of Us, in integrating EHR and patient surveys to enhance precision medicine. And the inclusion of SDoH clustering labels revealed the significant impact of sociobehavioral factors on patient outcomes, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive health determinants in predictive models. Despite these advancements, limitations include the exclusion of genetic data, broad categorization of CVD conditions, and the need for fairness analyses to ensure equitable model performance across diverse populations. Future work should refine clinical and social variable measurements, incorporate advanced imputation techniques, and explore additional predictive algorithms to enhance model precision and fairness. This study demonstrates the liability of the All of Us's diverse dataset in developing a multi-modality predictive model for CVD in BC survivors risk stratification in oncological survivorship. The data integration pipeline and subsequent predictive models establish a methodological foundation for future research into personalized healthcare.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Humans; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Electronic Health Records; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; United States; Aged; Cancer Survivors; Social Determinants of Health; Datasets as Topic; ROC Curve,False,0
All of Us,39321407,Brain Health Outcomes in Sexual and Gender Minority Groups: Results From the All of Us Research Program.,"Sexual and gender minority (SGM) groups have been historically underrepresented in neurologic research, and their brain health disparities are unknown. We aim to evaluate whether SGM persons are at higher risk of adverse brain health outcomes compared with cisgender straight (non-SGM) individuals. We conducted a cross-sectional study in the All of Us Research Program, a US population-based study, including all participants with information on gender identity and sexual orientation. We used baseline questionnaires to identify sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, diverse sexual orientation; nonstraight sexual orientation) and gender minority (gender diverse and transgender; gender identity different from sex assigned at birth) participants. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke, dementia, and late-life depression, assessed using electronic health record data and self-report. Secondarily, we evaluated each disease separately. Furthermore, we evaluated all subgroups of gender and sexual minorities stratified by sex assigned at birth. We used multivariable logistic regression (adjusted for age, sex assigned at birth, race/ethnicity, cardiovascular risk factors, other relevant comorbidities, and neighborhood deprivation index) to assess the relationship between SGM groups and the outcomes. Of 413,457 US adults enrolled between May 31, 2017, and June 30, 2022, we included 393,041 participants with available information on sexual orientation and gender identity (mean age 51 [SD 17] years), of whom 39,632 (10%) belonged to SGM groups. Of them, 38,528 (97%) belonged to a sexual minority and 4,431 (11%) to a gender minority. Compared with non-SGM, SGM persons had 15% higher odds of the brain health composite outcome (odds ratio [OR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.08-1.22). In secondary analyses, these results persisted across sexual and gender minorities separately (all 95% CIs > 1). Assessing individual diseases, all SGM groups had higher odds of dementia (SGM vs non-SGM: OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.29) and late-life depression (SGM vs non-SGM: OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.17-1.38) and transgender women had higher odds of stroke (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.04-2.70). In a large US population study, SGM persons had higher odds of adverse brain health outcomes.

A new FDA approved treatment for vitiligo offers considerable promise, and to maximize benefits strategies to implementation should consider disease burden, healthcare access, and healthcare utilization of individuals with vitiligo. Using the All of Us Research Program's large data set, including survey responses, we investigated these outcomes among participants with and without vitiligo. Our analysis used quality of life, delayed care due to an obstacle, and seeing a doctor in the past year as dichotomized proxies for disease burden, healthcare access, and healthcare utilization. The results show that people with vitiligo are more likely to report worse quality of life but ostensibly greater healthcare access and utilization compared to people without vitiligo. However, these relationships are not significant when adjusted for demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, and comorbidities of vitiligo. Prior research has shown non-Caucasian individuals have worse health outcomes in general, and worse quality of life within the vitiligo population. Our data demonstrated consistent findings; moreover, we found that non-Caucasian individuals with vitiligo had inferior healthcare access and lower health care utilization than Caucasian individuals.

This report outlines processes used to construct the All of Us Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) survey and presents the psychometric characteristics of SDOH survey measures in All of Us. A consensus process was used to select SDOH measures, prioritizing concepts validated in diverse populations and other national cohort surveys. Survey item non-response was calculated, and Cronbach's alpha was used to analyze psychometric properties of scales. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine associations between demographic categories and item non-response. Twenty-nine percent (N = 117,783) of eligible All of Us participants submitted SDOH survey data for these analyses. Most scales had less than 5% incalculable scores due to item non-response. Patterns of item non-response were seen by racial identity, educational attainment, income level, survey language, and age. Internal consistency reliability was greater than 0.80 for almost all scales and most demographic groups. The SDOH survey demonstrated good to excellent reliability across several measures and within multiple populations underrepresented in biomedical research.

We identified patients prescribed semaglutide and analysed differences in route of administration and the time on semaglutide. For individuals diagnosed with obesity, we measured changes in body mass index (BMI) and weight from baseline, while measured changes in HbA1c for those patients with type 2 diabetes. We also examined the occurrence of newly diagnosed common adverse events from taking semaglutide. For 3739 semaglutide patients, those on injectable semaglutide (3364 patients) averaged 301.54 days on the medication, with 20.36% having no end date, while those on oral semaglutide (435 patients) averaged 172.48 days, with 24.60% having no end date. We found average decreases of 1.54 kg/m Consistent with clinical trial findings, this real-world data analysis showed that semaglutide was well tolerated and that, for a large population, it effectively reduced BMI, body weight and HbA1c, albeit to smaller magnitudes than observed in clinical trials.

The objective of our study was to forecast the prevalence of comorbidities and multimorbidity among people with HIV (PWH) using antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the United States (US) through 2030. Using the PEARL model-an agent-based simulation of PWH who have initiated ART in the US-the prevalence of anxiety, depression, stage ≥3 chronic kidney disease (CKD), dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, end-stage liver disease (ESLD), myocardial infarction (MI), and multimorbidity (≥2 mental or physical comorbidities, other than HIV) were forecasted through 2030. Simulations were informed by the US CDC HIV surveillance data of new HIV diagnosis and the longitudinal North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD) data on risk of comorbidities from 2009 to 2017. The simulated population represented 15 subgroups of PWH including Hispanic, non-Hispanic White (White), and non-Hispanic Black/African American (Black/AA) men who have sex with men (MSM), men and women with history of injection drug use and heterosexual men and women. Simulations were replicated for 200 runs and forecasted outcomes are presented as median values (95% uncertainty ranges are presented in the Supporting information). In 2020, PEARL forecasted a median population of 670,000 individuals receiving ART in the US, of whom 9% men and 4% women with history of injection drug use, 60% MSM, 8% heterosexual men, and 19% heterosexual women. Additionally, 44% were Black/AA, 32% White, and 23% Hispanic. Along with a gradual rise in population size of PWH receiving ART-reaching 908,000 individuals by 2030-PEARL forecasted a surge in prevalence of most comorbidities to 2030. Depression and/or anxiety was high and increased from 60% in 2020 to 64% in 2030. Hypertension decreased while dyslipidemia, diabetes, CKD, and MI increased. There was little change in prevalence of cancer and ESLD. The forecasted multimorbidity among PWH receiving ART increased from 63% in 2020 to 70% in 2030. There was heterogeneity in trends across subgroups. Among Black women with history of injection drug use in 2030 (oldest demographic subgroup with median age of 66 year), dyslipidemia, CKD, hypertension, diabetes, anxiety, and depression were most prevalent, with 92% experiencing multimorbidity. Among Black MSM in 2030 (youngest demographic subgroup with median age of 42 year), depression and CKD were highly prevalent, with 57% experiencing multimorbidity. These results are limited by the assumption that trends in new HIV diagnoses, mortality, and comorbidity risk observed in 2009 to 2017 will persist through 2030; influences occurring outside this period are not accounted for in the forecasts. The PEARL forecasts suggest a continued rise in comorbidity and multimorbidity prevalence to 2030, marked by heterogeneities across race/ethnicity, gender, and HIV acquisition risk subgroups. HIV clinicians must stay current on the ever-changing comorbidities-specific guidelines to provide guideline-recommended care.

However, PARPi-resistance is rising, and there is currently an unmet need to combat PARPi-resistant tumors. Here, we created an immunocompetent, PARPi-resistant mouse model to test the efficacy of combinatory PARPi and euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1/2 inhibitor (EHMTi) in the treatment of PARPi-resistant ovarian cancer. We discovered that inhibition of EHMT1/2 resensitizes cells to PARPi. Markedly, we show that single EHMTi and combinatory EHMTi/PARPi significantly reduced PARPi-resistant tumor burden and that this reduction is partially dependent on CD8 T cells. Altogether, our results show a low-toxicity drug that effectively treats PARPi-resistant ovarian cancer in an immune-dependent manner, supporting its entry into clinical development and potential incorporation of immunotherapy.

We examined these therapies and glycemic control in US adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and sociodemographic factors. In the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative All of Us Research Program, we categorized DM as (1) moderate risk, (2) high risk, and (3) with ASCVD. We examined proportions on DM therapies, including SGLT2-i or GLP-1 RA, and at glycemic control by sociodemographic factors and CVD risk groups. Our 81,332 adults aged ≥ 18 years with DM across 340 US sites included 22.3% non-Hispanic Black, 17.2% Hispanic, and 1.8% Asian participants; 31.1%, 30.3%, and 38.6% were at moderate risk, high risk, or with ASCVD, respectively. Those with DM and ASCVD were most likely on SGLT2-i (8.6%) or GLP-1 RA (11.9%). SGLT2-i use was < 10% in those with heart failure or chronic kidney disease.

However, as prior studies focused on individual-level socioeconomic characteristics, how contextual deprivation modifies the association of PM2.5 exposure with cardiovascular health remains unclear. To assess disparities in PM2.5 exposure association with cardiovascular disease among subpopulations defined by different socioeconomic characteristics. This cohort study used longitudinal data on participants with electronic health records (EHRs) from the All of Us Research Program between calendar years 2016 and 2022. Statistical analysis was performed from September 25, 2023, through February 23, 2024. Satellite-derived 5-year mean PM2.5 exposure at the 3-digit zip code level according to participants' residential address. Incident myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke were obtained from the EHRs. Stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) between PM2.5 exposure and incident MI or stroke. We evaluated subpopulations defined by 3 socioeconomic characteristics: contextual deprivation (less deprived, more deprived), annual household income (≥$50 000, <$50 000), and race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White). We calculated the ratio of HRs (RHR) to quantify disparities between these subpopulations. A total of 210 554 participants were analyzed (40% age >60 years; 59.4% female; 16.7% Hispanic, 19.4% Non-Hispanic Black, 56.1% Non-Hispanic White, 7.9% other [American Indian, Asian, more than 1 race and ethnicity]), among whom 954 MI and 1407 stroke cases were identified. Higher PM2.5 levels were associated with higher MI and stroke risks. However, disadvantaged groups (more deprived, income <$50 000 per year, Black race) were more vulnerable to high PM2.5 levels. The disparities were most pronounced between groups defined by contextual deprivation. For instance, increasing PM2.5 from 6 to 10 μg/m3, the HR for stroke was 1.13 (95% CI, 0.85-1.51) in the less-deprived vs 2.57 (95% CI, 2.06-3.21) in the more-deprived cohort; 1.46 (95% CI, 1.07-2.01) in the $50 000 or more per year vs 2.27 (95% CI, 1.73-2.97) in the under $50 000 per year cohort; and 1.70 (95% CI, 1.35-2.16) in White individuals vs 2.76 (95% CI, 1.89-4.02) in Black individuals.

All of Us,38696234,Harnessing Consumer Wearable Digital Biomarkers for Individualized Recognition of Postpartum Depression Using the All of Us Research Program Data Set: Cross-Sectional Study.,"Postpartum depression (PPD) poses a significant maternal health challenge. The current approach to detecting PPD relies on in-person postpartum visits, which contributes to underdiagnosis. Furthermore, recognizing PPD symptoms can be challenging. Therefore, we explored the potential of using digital biomarkers from consumer wearables for PPD recognition. The main goal of this study was to showcase the viability of using machine learning (ML) and digital biomarkers related to heart rate, physical activity, and energy expenditure derived from consumer-grade wearables for the recognition of PPD. Using the All of Us Research Program Registered Tier v6 data set, we performed computational phenotyping of women with and without PPD following childbirth. Intraindividual ML models were developed using digital biomarkers from Fitbit to discern between prepregnancy, pregnancy, postpartum without depression, and postpartum with depression (ie, PPD diagnosis) periods. Models were built using generalized linear models, random forest, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor algorithms and evaluated using the κ statistic and multiclass area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (mAUC) to determine the algorithm with the best performance. The specificity of our individualized ML approach was confirmed in a cohort of women who gave birth and did not experience PPD. Moreover, we assessed the impact of a previous history of depression on model performance. We determined the variable importance for predicting the PPD period using Shapley additive explanations and confirmed the results using a permutation approach. Finally, we compared our individualized ML methodology against a traditional cohort-based ML model for PPD recognition and compared model performance using sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F Patient cohorts of women with valid Fitbit data who gave birth included <20 with PPD and 39 without PPD. Our results demonstrated that intraindividual models using digital biomarkers discerned among prepregnancy, pregnancy, postpartum without depression, and postpartum with depression (ie, PPD diagnosis) periods, with random forest (mAUC=0.85; κ=0.80) models outperforming generalized linear models (mAUC=0.82; κ=0.74), support vector machine (mAUC=0.75; κ=0.72), and k-nearest neighbor (mAUC=0.74; κ=0.62). Model performance decreased in women without PPD, illustrating the method's specificity. Previous depression history did not impact the efficacy of the model for PPD recognition. Moreover, we found that the most predictive biomarker of PPD was calories burned during the basal metabolic rate. Finally, individualized models surpassed the performance of a conventional cohort-based model for PPD detection. This research establishes consumer wearables as a promising tool for PPD identification and highlights personalized ML approaches, which could transform early disease detection strategies.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,2024,"Humans; Depression, Postpartum; Female; Adult; Biomarkers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Wearable Electronic Devices; Machine Learning; Pregnancy; United States; Datasets as Topic; ROC Curve",False,8

Despite the high HIV disease burden among SGMs, there was limited data on whether they are at higher risk of virologic failure, which may lead to potential disease progression and increased transmission risk. The All of Us (AoU) Research Program, a national community-engaged program aiming to improve health and facilitate health equity in the United States by partnering with one million participants, provides a promising resource for identifying a diverse and large volunteer TGD cohort. Leveraging various data sources available through AoU, the current study aims to explore the association between sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) and longitudinal virologic failure among adult people with HIV (PWH) in the US.

Based on participants' sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex assigned at birth, their SOGI were categorized into six groups, including cisgender heterosexual women, cisgender heterosexual men, cisgender sexual minority women, cisgender sexual minority men, gender minority people assigned female at birth of any sexual orientation, and gender minority people assigned male at birth of any sexual orientation. Yearly virologic failure was defined yearly after one's first viral load testing, and individuals with at least one viral load test > 50 copies/mL during a year were defined as having virologic failure at that year. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to explore the association between SOGI and longitudinal virologic failure while adjusting for potential confounders, including age, race, ethnicity, education attainment, income, and insurance type. A total of 1,546 eligible PWH were extracted from the AoU database, among whom 1,196 (77.36%) had at least one viral failure and 773 (50.00%) belonged to SGMs. Compared to cisgender heterosexual women, cisgender sexual minority women (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.05-3.27) were at higher risk of HIV virologic failure. Additionally, PWH who were Black vs. White (aOR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.52-3.04) and whose insurance type was Medicaid vs. Private insurance (aOR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.33-3.21) were more likely to experience virologic failure. Maintaining frequent viral load monitoring among sexual minority women with HIV is warranted because it allows early detection of virologic failure, which could provide opportunities for interventions to strengthen treatment adherence and prevent HIV transmission. To understand the specific needs of subgroups of SGMs, future research needs to examine the mechanisms for SOGI-based disparities in virologic failure and the combined effects of multi-level psychosocial and health behavior characteristics.",BMC public health,2024,Humans; HIV Infections; Female; Male; Adult; United States; Retrospective Studies; Gender Identity; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Middle Aged; Sexual Behavior; Viral Load; Young Adult; Treatment Failure,False,0
All of Us,39163132,Protein-truncating variant in APOL3 increases chronic kidney disease risk in epistasis with APOL1 risk alleles.,"BACKGROUNDTwo coding alleles within the APOL1 gene, G1 and G2, found almost exclusively in individuals genetically similar to West African populations, contribute substantially to the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The APOL gene cluster on chromosome 22 contains a total of 6 APOL genes that have arisen as a result of gene duplication.METHODSUsing a genome-first approach in the Penn Medicine BioBank, we identified 62 protein-altering variants in the 6 APOL genes with a minor allele frequency of >0.1% in a population of participants genetically similar to African reference populations and performed population-specific phenome-wide association studies.RESULTSWe identified rs1108978, a stop-gain variant in APOL3 (p.Q58*), to be significantly associated with increased CKD risk, even after conditioning on APOL1 G1/G2 carrier status. These findings were replicated in the Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program and the All of Us Research Program. APOL3 p.Q58* was also significantly associated with a number of quantitative traits linked to CKD, including decreased kidney volume. This truncating variant contributed the most risk for CKD in patients monoallelic for APOL1 G1/G2, suggesting an epistatic interaction and a potential protective effect of wild-type APOL3 against APOL1-induced kidney disease.CONCLUSIONThis study demonstrates the utility of targeting population-specific variants in a genome-first approach, even in the context of well-studied gene-disease relationships.FUNDINGNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (F30HL172382, R01HL169378, R01HL169458), Doris Duke Foundation (grant 2023-2024), National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (P41EB029460), and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (UL1-TR-001878).",JCI insight,2024,"Humans; Apolipoprotein L1; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Epistasis, Genetic; Alleles; Male; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Aged; Gene Frequency; Risk Factors",False,0

Research on VEXAS has largely focused on highly symptomatic patients. We sought to determine the prevalence of canonical, VEXAS-associated somatic variants and their disease penetrance in a diverse, unselected population. We analyzed clinical-grade whole genome sequencing data from 245,368 participants in the All of Us Research Program. We compared persons carrying a canonical VEXAS-associated somatic variant to age, sex, and ancestry matched controls across the domains of diagnoses, medications, and laboratory values. 74 participants were identified who carry one VEXAS-defining somatic variant, UBA1 c.121A>C, p.Met41Leu. The variant allele fraction ranged from 4.5% to 33%. No other canonical VEXAS-associated variants were identified. Of the 74 carriers, 62 (84%) were women, 20 (27%) were African American, and 14 (19%) were American Admixed/Latino. There was no statistically significant association between case/control status and any VEXAS-associated diagnosis code, medication prescription, or laboratory value. We report the largest cohort to date of persons with the VEXAS-associated p.Met41Leu somatic variant. This cohort differed substantially from reported cohorts of patients with clinical VEXAS, having a higher proportion of persons who were young, female, and of diverse ancestry. Variant allele fractions were lower than reported in clinical VEXAS cohorts, and bioinformatic analysis detected no clinical manifestations of VEXAS. Thus, the UBA1 p.Met41Leu somatic variant displayed incomplete penetrance for VEXAS. Further study is needed to determine the natural history of VEXAS-associated somatic variants in the predisease phase.","Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",2024,"Cohort Studies; United States; Whole Genome Sequencing; Female; Humans; Autoimmune Diseases; Adult; Skin Diseases, Genetic; Male; Young Adult; Hispanic or Latino; Adolescent; Penetrance; Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes; Myelodysplastic Syndromes; Genetic Variation; Black or African American; Middle Aged",False,2

We used weighted multivariable logistic regression to evaluate associations between the most valuable information types, access to providers, and sociodemographic variables. Participants (N = 20,405) were diverse in their race/ethnicity (eg, 52% were White, 18% were Hispanic/Latino or Spanish, 3% were Asian, and 20% were Black or African American). Most participants (78.6%) valued information about their risk of serious genetic diseases with available treatment. Primary care physicians, specialists, and genetic counselors were the top providers that participants could access for help understanding returned information. Information preferences and provider access varied across sociodemographic groups. For example, as income levels increased, the odds of placing value on genetic results indicating risk of serious disease with available treatment increased when compared with the lowest income levels (P value < .001).

Home-based and personal digital health technologies (DHTs) allow implementation of new models of care catering to the unique needs of individuals. The high number of respiratory triggers and unique responses to them require a personalised solution for each patient. The real-world, repetitive monitoring capabilities of DHTs enable identification of the normal operating characteristics for each individual and, therefore, recognition of the earliest deviations from that state.

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 is a well-known genetic risk factor for ICH among persons without AVM, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a vasculopathy frequently observed in APOE ε4 carriers that may increase the risk of ICH. To assess whether APOE ε4 is associated with a higher risk of ICH in patients with a known AVM. This cross-sectional study including 412 participants was conducted in 2 stages (discovery and replication) using individual-level data from the UK Biobank (released March 2012 and last updated October 2023) and the All of Us Research Program (commenced on May 6, 2018, with its latest update provided in October 2023). The occurrence of AVM and ICH was ascertained at the time of enrollment using validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision, codes. Genotypic data on the APOE variants rs429358 and rs7412 were used to ascertain the ε status. For each study, the association between APOE ε4 variants and ICH risk was assessed among patients with a known AVM by using multivariable logistic regression. The discovery phase included 253 UK Biobank participants with known AVM (mean [SD] age, 56.6 [8.0] years, 119 [47.0%] female), of whom 63 (24.9%) sustained an ICH. In the multivariable analysis of 240 participants of European ancestry, APOE ε4 was associated with a higher risk of ICH (odds ratio, 4.58; 95% CI, 2.13-10.34; P < .001). The replication phase included 159 participants with known AVM enrolled in All of Us (mean [SD] age, 57.1 [15.9] years; 106 [66.7%] female), of whom 29 (18.2%) sustained an ICH. In multivariable analysis of 101 participants of European ancestry, APOE ε4 was associated with higher risk of ICH (odds ratio, 4.52; 95% CI, 1.18-19.38; P = .03). The results of this cross-sectional study of patients from the UK Biobank and All of Us suggest that information on APOE ε4 status may help identify patients with brain AVM who are at particularly high risk of ICH and that cerebral amyloid angiopathy should be evaluated as a possible mediating mechanism of the observed association.",JAMA network open,2024,Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Apolipoprotein E4; Brain; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Cross-Sectional Studies; Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations,False,2

To examine odds of delaying care for any reason and, secondarily, for 7 specific reasons among TGD individuals and cisgender women compared with cisgender men in the All of Us Research Program. We calculated the odds of delayed care by gender identity relative to cisgender men using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, with adjustment for age, race, income, education, and Charlson comorbidity index. We examined 117,806 All of Us participants who completed the healthcare access and utilization survey. The primary outcome was self-reported delayed care in the past 12 months for any of 7 potential reasons: cost (out-of-pocket cost, co-payment costs, and/or high deductible), lack of childcare, lack of eldercare, nervousness associated with visiting the healthcare provider, rurality, inability to take time off work, and lack of transportation. Compared with cisgender men, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for delaying care for any reason was 1.48 (95% CI, 1.44-1.53; P < 0.001) among cisgender women, 1.65 (95% CI, 1.24-2.21; P < 0.001) among TGD individuals assigned male at birth, and 2.76 (95% CI, 2.26-3.39; P < 0.001) among TGD individuals assigned female at birth. Results were consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses. TGD individuals were substantially more likely to cite nervousness with visiting a healthcare provider as a barrier, whereas cisgender women were more likely to delay care due to lack of childcare coverage.

We employed a self-controlled case study method using electronic health record and survey data from 17,718 White, Hispanic, and Black participants who were diagnosed with essential hypertension and prescribed at least one of 19 commonly used antihypertensive medications. Effectiveness was determined by calculating the reduction in systolic blood pressure measurements after 28 or more days of drug exposure. Starting systolic blood pressure and effectiveness for each medication were compared for self-reported Black, Hispanic, and White participants using adjusted linear regressions. Black and Hispanic participants were started on antihypertensive medications at significantly higher SBP than White participants in 13 and 7 out of 19 medications, respectively. More Black participants were prescribed multiple antihypertensive medications (58.46%) than White (52.35%) or Hispanic (49.9%) participants. First-line HTN medications differed by race and ethnicity. Following the 2017 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association High Blood Pressure Guideline release, around 64% of Black participants were prescribed a recommended first-line antihypertensive drug compared with 76% of White and 82% of Hispanic participants.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the portability and suitability of tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) used to determine ABO alleles and blood types across diverse populations in published literature. Bibliographic databases were searched for studies using tSNPs to determine ABO alleles. We calculated linkage between tSNPs and functional variants across inferred continental ancestry groups from 1000 Genomes. We compared r2 across ancestry and assessed real-world consequences by comparing tSNP-derived blood types to serology in a diverse population from the All of Us Research Program. Linkage between functional variants and O allele tSNPs was significantly lower in African (median r2 = 0.443) compared to East Asian (r2 = 0.946, P = 1.1 × 10-5) and European (r2 = 0.869, P = .023) populations. In All of Us, discordance between tSNP-derived blood types and serology was high across all SNPs in African ancestry individuals and linkage was strongly correlated with discordance across all ancestries (ρ = -0.90, P = 3.08 × 10-23). Many studies determine ABO blood types using tSNPs. However, tSNPs with low linkage disequilibrium promote misinference of ABO blood types, particularly in diverse populations. We observe common use of inappropriate tSNPs to determine ABO blood type, particularly for O alleles and with some tSNPs mistyping up to 58% of individuals.

All of Us,39043412,Pregnancy episodes in All of Us: harnessing multi-source data for pregnancy-related research.,"The National Institutes of Health's All of Us Research Program addresses gaps in biomedical research by collecting health data from diverse populations. Pregnant individuals have historically been underrepresented in biomedical research, and pregnancy-related research is often limited by data availability, sample size, and inadequate representation of the diversity of pregnant people. All of Us integrates a wealth of health-related data, providing a unique opportunity to conduct comprehensive pregnancy-related research. We aimed to identify pregnancy episodes with high-quality electronic health record (EHR) data in All of Us Research Program data and evaluate the program's utility for pregnancy-related research. We used a previously published algorithm to identify pregnancy episodes in All of Us EHR data. We described these pregnancies, validated them with All of Us survey data, and compared them to national statistics. Our study identified 18 970 pregnancy episodes from 14 234 participants; other possible pregnancy episodes had low-quality or insufficient data. Validation against people who reported a current pregnancy on an All of Us survey found low false positive and negative rates. Demographics were similar in some respects to national data; however, Asian-Americans were underrepresented, and older, highly educated pregnant people were overrepresented. Our approach demonstrates the capacity of All of Us to support pregnancy research and reveals the diversity of the pregnancy cohort. However, we noted an underrepresentation among some demographics. Other limitations include measurement error in gestational age and limited data on non-live births. The wide variety of data in the All of Us program, encompassing EHR, survey, genomic, and fitness tracker data, offers a valuable resource for studying pregnancy, yet care must be taken to avoid biases.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Humans; Female; Pregnancy; United States; Electronic Health Records; Adult; Biomedical Research; Algorithms; Young Adult; Adolescent,False,1

Cross-sectional study. National database. Patients with a diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss from the National Institutes of Health All of Us database were included. Data entered from May 2018 to November 2022 was analyzed. Patient demographics such as age, gender, educational level, and insurance status were assessed. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed for statistical evaluation. A subset of 8875 patients (48.3% male, mean age 69) were evaluated. After multivariate analysis, female participants were more likely than male participants to report difficulty affording prescribed medications (odds ratio [OR]: 1.7, p < .0005) and specialists (OR: 1.4, p < 0.005). Female patients were also more likely to delay care due to elder care responsibilities (OR: 2.6, p < .0005), employment obligations (OR: 1.7, p < .0005), and feelings of apprehension in seeing a provider (OR: 1.7, p < .0005). Finally, female participants reported feeling less likely to be involved in their own medical care compared to males (OR: 1.2, p < .005). Low-income (<$25,000) participants reported less likely to feel respected (OR: 3.2, p < .0005) and delivered understandable health information (OR: 2.3, p < .0005) by providers compared to participants of higher income. This work suggests that patients with hearing loss, female gender, and lower socioeconomic status independently introduce barriers to health care access and utilization.

All of Us,38147345,Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy and Risk of Isolated Nontraumatic Subdural Hemorrhage.,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common cause of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in older patients. Although other types of intracranial hemorrhage can occur in conjunction with CAA-related intracerebral hemorrhage, the association between CAA and other subtypes of intracranial hemorrhage, particularly in the absence of intracerebral hemorrhage, remains poorly understood. To determine whether CAA is an independent risk factor for isolated nontraumatic subdural hemorrhage (SDH). A population-based cohort study was performed using a 2-stage analysis of prospectively collected data in the UK Biobank cohort (discovery phase, 2006-2022) and the All of Us Research Program cohort (replication phase, 2018-2022). Participants included those who contributed at least 1 year of data while they were older than 50 years, in accordance with the diagnostic criteria for CAA. Participants with prevalent intracranial hemorrhage were excluded. Data were analyzed from October 2022 to October 2023. A diagnosis of CAA, identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code. The outcome was an isolated nontraumatic SDH, identified using ICD-10-CM codes. Two identical analyses were performed separately in the 2 cohorts. First, the risk of SDH in patients with and without CAA was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for demographic characteristics, cardiovascular comorbidities, and antithrombotic medication use. Second, multivariable logistic regression was used to study the association between CAA and SDH. The final analytical sample comprised 487 223 of the total 502 480 individuals in the UK Biobank cohort and 158 008 of the total 372 082 individuals in the All of Us cohort. Among the 487 223 participants in the discovery phase of the UK Biobank, the mean (SD) age was 56.5 (8.1) years, and 264 195 (54.2%) were female. There were 649 cases of incident SDH. Of the 126 participants diagnosed with CAA, 3 (2.4%) developed SDH. In adjusted Cox regression analyses, participants with CAA had an increased risk of having an SDH compared with those without CAA (hazard ratio [HR], 8.0; 95% CI, 2.6-24.8). Multivariable logistic regression analysis yielded higher odds of SDH among participants with CAA (odds ratio [OR], 7.6; 95% CI, 1.8-20.4). Among the 158 008 participants in the All of Us cohort, the mean (SD) age was 63.0 (9.5) years, and 89 639 (56.7%) were female. The findings were replicated in All of Us, in which 52 participants had CAA and 320 had an SDH. All of Us participants with CAA had an increased risk of having an SDH compared with those without CAA (HR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.2-19.8). In adjusted multivariable logistic regression analysis, CAA was associated with higher odds of SDH (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 0.8-17.6). In 2 large, heterogeneous cohorts, CAA was associated with increased risk of SDH. These findings suggest that CAA may be a novel risk factor for isolated nontraumatic SDH.",JAMA neurology,2024,"Humans; Female; Aged; Middle Aged; Male; Cohort Studies; Population Health; Hematoma, Subdural; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Magnetic Resonance Imaging",False,0

Our objectives were to evaluate the burden of HIV and major depressive disorder (MDD) in underrepresented groups and the frequency of the HIV/MDD comorbidity. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis combining collected survey and electronic health record (EHR) data. We ascertained HIV and MDD cases using Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership codes. We used multivariable logistic regression to obtain the odds ratio of HIV in AoU participants and MDD in AoU participants with HIV. The latest AoU data release includes 412 211 participants: 254 700 have at least one medical condition concept in their EHR, of whom 5193 (1.3%) had HIV, and 2238 (43%) of those with HIV had a diagnosis of MDD. Black AoU participants had approximately 4.58 times the odds of having an HIV diagnosis compared with the combined odds of all other racial groups. AoU participants with HIV were more likely to have MDD (p = 0.001) than were participants without HIV. Among AoU participants, Black individuals have a disproportionately high burden of HIV, pointing to underlying factors such as social determinants of health, limited access to healthcare or prevention resources, and potential systemic biases that contribute to these differences. In addition, HIV is a risk factor for mental health issues like MDD. Further data collection from people with HIV will elucidate contributing factors and the need for interventions.",HIV medicine,2024,"Humans; Depressive Disorder, Major; HIV Infections; Male; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Adult; Middle Aged; Prevalence; United States; Young Adult; Electronic Health Records; Aged; Adolescent; Comorbidity",False,8

Thus, the current study applies an intersectional lens to identify health differences and similarities among Hispanic subgroups. Sociodemographic characteristics and health domain variables (i.e., health status, health services, and health behaviors) from participants (N = 11,192) were included in the analyses. Bivariate Chi-squared tests examined the relationship between sociodemographic and health domain variables Black Hispanic individuals, white Hispanic individuals, and non-Hispanic Black individuals. Findings suggest that Non-Hispanic Black American individuals reported the highest rates of hypertension (49.09%) and diabetes (19.62%) compared to Black-Hispanic individuals (22.45% and 12.98%) and white Hispanic individuals (22.22% and 8.02%). Black Hispanic individuals reported the greatest proportion of asthma diagnoses (35.10%) and those who saw a doctor in the previous year (95.52%) compared to white Hispanic individuals (26.84%, and 91.10%, respectively) and non-Hispanic Black individuals ( 21.74%, and 94.69%, respectively). Specifically, we found that several health behaviors and health-related outcomes significantly varied across different racial/ethnic groups, demonstrating the advantage of an intersectional approach to identify health disparities among racially diverse ethnic groups.

Of 17,233 patients (48.0% White, 30.7% Black, 19.7% Hispanic/Latino, 1.3% Asian, and 0.3% Middle Eastern and North African) with 82,188 asthma visits, Black participants had 20% shorter LOS and 12% higher odds of readmission, compared to White participants in multivariate analyses. Public-insured patients had 14% longer LOS and 39% higher readmission odds than commercially insured patients. Weekend admissions resulted in a 12% shorter LOS but 10% higher readmission odds. Asthmatics with chronic diseases had a longer LOS (range: 6-39%) and higher readmission odds (range: 9-32%) except for those with allergic rhinitis, who had a 23% shorter LOS. A comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing asthma hospitalization, in conjunction with diverse datasets and clinical-community partnerships, can help physicians and policymakers to systematically address racial disparities, healthcare utilization and equitable outcomes in asthma care.",Journal of translational medicine,2024,Humans; Asthma; Bayes Theorem; Length of Stay; Patient Readmission; Population Health; Race Factors; Retrospective Studies; United States,False,0
All of Us,38536175,Physical Activity and Incident Obesity Across the Spectrum of Genetic Risk for Obesity.,"Despite consistent public health recommendations, obesity rates in the US continue to increase. Physical activity recommendations do not account for individual genetic variability, increasing risk of obesity. To use activity, clinical, and genetic data from the All of Us Research Program (AoURP) to explore the association of genetic risk of higher body mass index (BMI) with the level of physical activity needed to reduce incident obesity. In this US population-based retrospective cohort study, participants were enrolled in the AoURP between May 1, 2018, and July 1, 2022. Enrollees in the AoURP who were of European ancestry, owned a personal activity tracking device, and did not have obesity up to 6 months into activity tracking were included in the analysis. Physical activity expressed as daily step counts and a polygenic risk score (PRS) for BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Incident obesity (BMI ≥30). A total of 3124 participants met inclusion criteria. Among 3051 participants with available data, 2216 (73%) were women, and the median age was 52.7 (IQR, 36.4-62.8) years. The total cohort of 3124 participants walked a median of 8326 (IQR, 6499-10 389) steps/d over a median of 5.4 (IQR, 3.4-7.0) years of personal activity tracking. The incidence of obesity over the study period increased from 13% (101 of 781) to 43% (335 of 781) in the lowest and highest PRS quartiles, respectively (P = 1.0 × 10-20). The BMI PRS demonstrated an 81% increase in obesity risk (P = 3.57 × 10-20) while mean step count demonstrated a 43% reduction (P = 5.30 × 10-12) when comparing the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. Individuals with a PRS in the 75th percentile would need to walk a mean of 2280 (95% CI, 1680-3310) more steps per day (11 020 total) than those at the 50th percentile to have a comparable risk of obesity. To have a comparable risk of obesity to individuals at the 25th percentile of PRS, those at the 75th percentile with a baseline BMI of 22 would need to walk an additional 3460 steps/d; with a baseline BMI of 24, an additional 4430 steps/d; with a baseline BMI of 26, an additional 5380 steps/d; and with a baseline BMI of 28, an additional 6350 steps/d. In this cohort study, the association between daily step count and obesity risk across genetic background and baseline BMI were quantified.

We applied our validated HTN computable phenotypes within the All of Us Research Program to uncover prevalence and characteristics of HTN and apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (aTRH) in United States. Within the All of Us Researcher Workbench, we built a retrospective cohort (January 1, 2008-July 1, 2023), identifying all adults with available age data, at least one blood pressure (BP) measurement, prescribed at least one antihypertensive medication, and with at least one SNOMED ""Essential hypertension"" diagnosis code. We identified 99 461 participants with HTN who met the eligibility criteria. Following the application of our computable phenotypes, an overall population of 81 462 were further categorized to aTRH (14.4%), stable-controlled HTN (SCH) (39.5%), and Other HTN (46.1%). Compared to participants with SCH, participants with aTRH were older, more likely to be of Black or African American race, had higher levels of social deprivation, and a heightened prevalence of comorbidities such as hyperlipidemia and diabetes. Heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes were the comorbidities most strongly associated with aTRH. β-blockers were the most prescribed antihypertensive medication.

All of Us,36876959,"Precision Medicine for Whom? Public Health Outputs from ""Genomics England"" and ""All of Us"" to Make Up for Upstream and Downstream Exclusion.","This paper problematizes the precision medicine approach embraced by the All of Us Research Program (US) and by Genomics England (UK) in terms of benefits distribution, by arguing that current ""diversity and inclusion"" efforts do not prevent exclusiveness, unless the framing and scope of the projects are revisited in public health terms. Grounded on document analysis and fieldwork interviews, this paper analyzes efforts to address potential patterns of exclusion upstream (from participating in precision medicine research) and downstream (from benefitting from precision medicine outputs). It argues that efforts for inclusion upstream are not corresponded downstream, and this unbalance jeopardizes the equitable capacities of the projects. It concludes that enhanced focus on socio-environmental determinants of health and aligned public health interventions as precision medicine outputs would be to the benefit of all and especially of those who are most at risk of (upstream as well as downstream) exclusion.",The American journal of bioethics : AJOB,2024,Humans; Population Health; Precision Medicine; Public Health; England; Genomics,False,5

Levering traumatic experiences reporting, genetic data, and electronic health records (EHR), we investigated and predicted the clinical comorbidities (co-phenome) of PTSD vulnerability and resilience in the UK Biobank (UKB) and All of Us Research Program (AoU), respectively. In 60,354 trauma-exposed UKB participants, we defined PTSD vulnerability and resilience considering PTSD symptoms, trauma burden, and polygenic risk scores. EHR-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) were conducted to dissect the co-phenomes of PTSD vulnerability and resilience. Significant diagnostic endpoints were applied as weights, yielding a phenotypic risk score (PheRS) to conduct PheWAS of PTSD vulnerability and resilience PheRS in up to 95,761 AoU participants. EHR-based PheWAS revealed three significant phenotypes positively associated with PTSD vulnerability (top association ""Sleep disorders"") and five outcomes inversely associated with PTSD resilience (top association ""Irritable Bowel Syndrome""). In the AoU cohort, PheRS analysis showed a partial inverse relationship between vulnerability and resilience with distinct comorbid associations.

Industrial practices generate ambient air pollution, including fine particulate matter of diameter ≤ 2.5μm (PM2.5). Studies investigating the relationship between PM2.5 and eczema in the US are scarce. The objective of this study was to determine the risk of eczema with PM2.5 exposure in a diverse national cohort of American adults. In this cross-sectional study, eczema cases in the All of Us Research Program were linked via three-digit zip code to average annual PM2.5 concentrations from the Center for Air, Climate, and Energy Solutions. Eczema cases and controls were compared using Pearson's χ2 test for categorical variables and one-way analysis of variance for continuous variables. The relationship between PM2.5 and eczema was assessed via logistic regression adjusting for demographic factors, smoking, and atopic comorbidities. Individuals with eczema (n = 12,695) lived in areas with significantly higher PM2.5 concentrations than did individuals without eczema (n = 274,127) (0.83 x 10 μg/m3 v. 0.81 x 10 μg/m3, P < .001). PM2.5 concentration was significantly associated with eczema in univariable analysis (odds ratio 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.77-2.19, P < .001), and in multivariable analyses, both controlling for demographics and smoking status (odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.98-2.47, P < .001) and with the addition of atopic comorbidities (odds ratio 2.38, 95% confidence interval 2.12-2.67, P < .001).

This study investigated an automatic error detection algorithm for adult height and weight measurements in EHR for the All of Us Research Program (All of Us). We developed reference charts for adult heights and weights that were stratified on participant sex. Our analysis included 4,076,534 height and 5,207,328 wt measurements from ∼ 150,000 participants. Errors were identified using modified standard deviation scores, differences from their expected values, and significant changes between consecutive measurements. We evaluated our method with chart-reviewed heights (8,092) and weights (9,039) from 250 randomly selected participants and compared it with the current cleaning algorithm in All of Us. The proposed algorithm classified 1.4 % of height and 1.5 % of weight errors in the full cohort. Sensitivity was 90.4 % (95 % CI: 79.0-96.8 %) for heights and 65.9 % (95 % CI: 56.9-74.1 %) for weights.

The purpose of this study was to describe the rural populations identified in the All of Us Research Program using the only proxy measure currently available in the dataset. Currently, the All of Us Research Program provides a proxy measure of rurality that identifies participants who self-reported delaying care due to far travel distances associated with living in rural areas. Using the All of Us Controlled Tier Dataset v6, we compared sociodemographic and health characteristics of All of Us rural participants identified via this proxy to rural US residents from nationally representative data sources using chi-squared tests. 3.1% of 160,880 All of Us participants were rural, compared to 15%-20% of US residents based on commonly accepted rural definitions. Proportionally more rural All of Us participants reported fair or poor health status, history of cancer, and history of heart disease (P<.01). The All of Us measure may capture a subset of underserved participants who live in rural areas and experience health care access barriers due to distance.

All of Us,38621331,The sex-dependent impact of adipose tissue and inflammation on chronic pain - A cross-sectional study from the all of us research program.,"Emerging evidence suggests an association between chronic pain and elevated body fat. We sought to determine if individuals with higher body fat, measured by hip circumference (HC) and waist circumference (WC), are at risk for chronic pain when they demonstrate higher expression of inflammatory markers. We investigated the incidence and severity of pain in patients with varying WC/HC and inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein, IL-6, leptin) using the NIH-sponsored All of Us Database. For each inflammatory marker and sex, participants were divided into four groups based on combinations of normal/high marker levels and small/large WC/HC. We used statistical analysis to compare WC/HC and pain severity (mean NRS pain score) between groups of the same sex. In females, but not males, combinations of elevated CRP with large WC/HC exerted additive effects on the incidence of chronic pain (p < 0.01) and severe pain (p < 0.001), as well as on the severity of pain evaluated by the mean NRS pain score (p < 0.01). This relationship held true for females with high IL-6 or leptin and large WC or HC (p < 0.001 for chronic pain and severe pain incidence, and p < 0.05 for pain severity). Neither IL-6 nor leptin showed any significant impact on pain in males. Obesity status and CRP exert additive prognostic effects for chronic pain in females, but not in males. The concomitant evaluation of other inflammatory factors, such as IL-6 or leptin in females, may further augment the prediction of chronic pain.

Data from the All of Us Research Program participants ≥50 years old were analyzed using marginal structural modelling to assess if frailty or healthcare delays mediated OSGM status and healthcare utilization. OSGM status, healthcare delays, and frailty were assessed using survey data. Electronic health record (EHR) data was used to measure the number of medical visits or mental health (MH) visit days, following 12 months from the calculated All of Us Frailty Index. Analyses adjusted for age, race and ethnicity, income, HIV, marital status ± general MH (only MH analyses). Compared to non-OSGM, OSGM adults have higher rates of medical visits (adjusted rate ratio [aRR]: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.24) and MH visits (aRR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.91). Frailty mediated the association between OSGM status medical visits (Controlled direct effect [Rcde] aRR: 1.03, 95% CI [0.87, 1.22]), but not MH visits (Rcde aRR: 0.37 [95% CI: 0.06, 1.47]). Delays mediated the association between OSGM status and MH visit days (Rcde aRR: 2.27, 95% CI [1.15, 3.76]), but not medical visits (Rcde aRR: 1.06 [95% CI: 0.97, 1.17]). Frailty represents a need for medical care among OSGM adults, highlighting the importance of addressing it to improve health and healthcare utilization disparities. In contrast, healthcare delays are a barrier to MH care, underscoring the necessity of targeted strategies to ensure timely MH care for OSGM adults.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Humans; Male; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; United States; Frailty; Time-to-Treatment,False,8

However, the information is not from national representative populations with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). We aim to examine whether socioeconomic disparity for kidney transplant access exists by utilizing data from the All of Us Research Program. We analyzed data of adult ESKD patients using the All of Us Researcher Workbench. The association of socioeconomic data including types of health insurance, levels of education, and household incomes with kidney transplant access was evaluated by multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted by baseline demographic, medical comorbidities, and behavioral information. Among 4078 adults with ESKD, mean diagnosis age was 54 and 51.64% were male. The majority had Medicare (39.6%), were non-graduate college (75.79%), and earned $10 000-24 999 annual income (20.16%). After adjusting for potential confounders, insurance status emerged as a significant predictor of kidney transplant access. Individuals covered by Medicaid (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.58; P-value < .001) or uninsured (AOR 0.21; 95% CI, 0.12-0.37; P-value < .001) exhibited lower odds of transplantation compared to those with private insurance. Our findings reveal the influence of insurance status and socioeconomic factors on access to kidney transplantation among ESKD patients.

We assess how research participants engage with summaries via email communication and how this can be improved. We look at correlations between demographic subgroups and engagement in a longitudinal dataset of 305 626 participants (77% are classified as underrepresented in biomedical research) from the All of Us Research Program. We compare this against engagement with other program communications and use impact evaluations (N = 421 510) to measure the effect of tailoring communication by (1) eliciting content preferences, (2) Spanish focused content, (3) informational videos, and (4) article content in the email subject line. Between March 2020 and October 2021, research summaries reached 67% of enrolled participants, outperforming other program communication (60%) and return of results (31%), which have a high uptake rate but have been extended to a subset of eligible participants. While all demographic subgroups engage with research summaries, participants with higher income, educational attainment, White, and older than 45 years open and click content most often. Surfacing article content in the email subject line and Spanish focused content had negative effects on engagement. Video and social media content and eliciting preferences led to a small directional increase in clicks. Further individualization of tailoring efforts may be needed to drive larger engagement effects (eg, delivering multiple articles in line with stated preferences, expanding preference options). Our findings are likely a conservative representation of engagement effects, given the coarseness of our click rate measure. Health research summaries show promise as a way to return value to research participants, especially if individual-level results cannot be returned.

This study addresses this gap by using commercial activity monitoring (Fitbit) data from the All of Us dataset. The primary objectives were to describe the prevalence of adherence to the 2018 PAGA and identify associated sociodemographic determinants. Additionally, we compared 3 distinct methods of processing physical activity (PA) data to estimate adherence to the 2008 PAGA. We used the National Institutes of Health's All of Us dataset, which contains minute-level Fitbit data for 13,947 US adults over a 7-year time span (2015-2022), to estimate adherence to PAGA. A published step-based method was used to estimate metabolic equivalents and assess adherence to the 2018 PAGA (ie, ≥150 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA per week). We compared the step-based method, the heart rate-based method, and the proprietary Fitbit-developed algorithm to estimate adherence to the 2008 PAGA. The average overall adherence to the 2018 PAGA was 21.6% (3006/13,947; SE 0.4%). Factors associated with lower adherence in multivariate logistic regression analysis included female sex (relative to male sex; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.60-0.72; P<.001); BMI of 25.0-29.9 kg/m Our results show significant sociodemographic differences in PAGA adherence and notably different estimates of adherence depending on the algorithm used.

Patient portal-based recruitment was implemented at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Patient engagement was assessed using patient's electronic health record (EHR) at four recruitment stages: Consenting to be contacted, opening messages, responding to messages, and showing interest in participating. Demographic and socioeconomic data were also collected from patient's EHR and univariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess patient engagement. Between October 2022 and November 2023, a total of 59 592 patients received patient portal messages inviting them to join the AoURP. Among them, 24 445 (41.0%) opened the message, 8983 (15.1%) responded, and 3765 (6.3%) showed interest in joining the program. Though we were unable to link enrollment data with EHR data, we estimate about 2% of patients contacted ultimately enrolled in the AoURP. Patients from underrepresented race and ethnicity communities had lower odds of consenting to be contacted and opening messages, but higher odds of showing interest after responding. Patient portal messaging provided both patients and recruitment staff with a more efficient approach to outreach, but patterns of engagement varied across UBR groups. Patient portal-based recruitment enables researchers to contact a substantial number of participants from diverse communities.

This project utilizes data from the All of Us Research Program to contrast a panel of wellness and disease-risk indicators across a range of self-reported tobacco-use profiles, including smokers, current, and former EC users. This article focuses on the tobacco use history and current tobacco use status among All of Us participants enrolled between May 2017 and February 2023 (Registered Controlled Tier Curated Data Repository [CDR] v7). The present analytic sample included an unweighted total of N = 412 211 individuals with information on ever-use of both CC and EC.

Of all participants, 6,828 (10.4%) completed any follow-up surveys (1448: telephone; 522: postal; 486: combination; 4372: controls). Follow-up survey completions were 24% higher in the telephone appointment arm than in controls in bivariate analyses. When controlling for confounders, telephone appointment and combination arms increased rates of completion similarly compared to controls, while the postal arm had no significant effect (odds ratio [95% Confidence Interval], telephone appointment:2.01[1.81-2.23]; combination:1.91[1.66-2.20]; postal:0.92[0.79-1.07]). Although the effects of the telephone appointment and combination arms were similar, differential effects were observed across sub-populations.

As it is well established that sociodemographic factors drive cervical cancer care inequity, we aimed to evaluate their impact on catch-up HPV vaccination rates in adults. The All of Us (AoU) Research Program is a longitudinal cohort study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. All participants ages 18-47 assigned female sex at birth enrolled between May 2018 and April 2023 were included in this analysis. Primary outcome was receipt of HPV vaccination. Bivariable and multivariable tests were used to examine associations. A total of 113,344 participants were identified in the AoU program, with 53 % (n = 60,594) self-identifying as a racial or ethnic minority. Only 3575 participants (3.2 %) were documented as having received HPV vaccination. Median age of vaccination was 26 and participants ages 18-27 were more likely to be vaccinated. Participants without health insurance (OR = 0.32, 95 % CI 0.26-0.40), stable employment (OR = 0.85, 95 % CI 0.79-0.91), and those who reported lower income (OR = 0.87, 95 % CI 0.79-0.97) were significantly less likely to have received HPV vaccination. Participants who described cost as a barrier to healthcare were also less likely to have received HPV vaccination (OR = 0.82, 95 % CI 0.73-0.93). Sociodemographic factors including low income, lack of health insurance, and lack of stable employment were all associated with lower likelihood of catch-up HPV vaccination among adult women living in the United States.",Gynecologic oncology,2024,Humans; Female; Adult; Papillomavirus Vaccines; United States; Young Adult; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Papillomavirus Infections; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Healthcare Disparities; Longitudinal Studies; Vaccination; Cohort Studies; Human Papillomavirus Viruses,False,8

Despite extensive research on the genetic etiology of ASD and the phenotypic overlaps between ASD and GD, a genetic component linking the two has not been explored thoroughly. Our study addresses this gap by integrating phenotypic data and genetic variations, specifically single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to construct a network graph that reveals potential genetic intersections between these conditions. We identify a single gene linking ASD and GD, indicating a potential genetic overlap. This finding is significant as the gene has been associated with several psychiatric conditions, including ASD.Clinical relevance-The study's methodology extends existing research by combining phenotypic and genetic data to analyze the comorbidity of two different conditions. Our results not only provide insights into the genetic correlations between ASD and GD but also demonstrate the utility of network science in medical research. The approach used here could be generalized to other conditions, offering a new way to understand genetic relationships in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

We tested the hypothesis that participants with a history of stroke have a worse cardiovascular prevention profile in comparison to participants with MI. In cross-sectional analyses within the UK Biobank and All of Us Research Program, involving 14 760 (9193 strokes, 5567 MIs) and 7315 (2948 strokes, 4367 MIs) participants, respectively, we evaluated cardiovascular prevention profiles assessing low-density lipoprotein (<100 mg/dL), blood pressure (systolic, <140 mm Hg; and diastolic, <90 mm Hg), statin and antiplatelet use, and a cardiovascular prevention score that required meeting at least 3 of these criteria. The results revealed that, within the UK Biobank, patients with stroke had significantly lower odds of meeting all the preventive criteria compared with patients with MI: low-density lipoprotein control (odds ratio [OR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.68-0.78];  In 2 independent national cohorts, patients with stroke showed poorer cardiovascular prevention profiles and lower adherence to guideline-directed therapies compared with patients with MI.

A cross-sectional study was conducted using overall health and SDOH survey data collected by the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program from May 2017 to September 2023. While 1250 enrolled participants with ovarian cancer met the inclusion criteria, 414 (33%) completed SDOH surveys: 29 (7%) AA/Black, 33 (8%) Hispanic, and 352 (85%) White. In the ordinal logistic regression models, for every unit increase in the SDOH neighborhood characteristics score, the odds of having a poor perception of general health decreased by 0.96 times. For every unit increase in the SDOH day-to-day discrimination score, the odds of having a poor perception of general health, general mental health, social satisfaction decreased by 0.95, 0.94 and 0.93 times respectively. For every unit increase in the SDOH food and housing security score, the odds of having a poor perception of general health decreased by 0.57 times. Compared to White ovarian cancer survivors, AA/Black and Hispanic ovarian cancer survivors were significantly more likely to have a poor perception of general health, general mental health, and social satisfaction even when adjusting for these SDOH.

Nonethleess, the relationship between dermatologic disease and AUD, and the relative contribution of depression and anxiety, are poorly understood. Here, we utilize the National Insittutes of Health All of Us Research Program to investigate the association between inflammatory and pigmentary dermatologic diseases with AUD. Furthermore, we investigate whether comorbid depression and anxiety mediates this relationship. We employed a matched case-control model with multivariable logistic regression. We also employed a mediation analysis. We found an increased odds of AUD among patients with atopic dermatitis, acne/rosacea, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriasis, and pigmentary disorders (vitiligo, melasma, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation). This was partially mediated by anxiety and depression, especially for diseases with a significant cosmetic component.

Our approach utilizes aggregated SDoH datasets to estimate individual-level SDoH, demonstrated with examples of no high school diploma (NOHSDP) and no health insurance (UNINSUR) variables. Models are estimated using American Community Survey data and applied to derive individual-level estimates for All of Us participants. We assess concordance between model-based SDoH estimates and self-reported SDoHs in All of Us and examine associations with undiagnosed hypertension and diabetes. Compared to self-reported SDoHs, the area under the curve for NOHSDP is 0.727 (95% CI, 0.724-0.730) and for UNINSUR is 0.730 (95% CI, 0.727-0.733) among the 329 074 All of Us participants, both significantly higher than aggregated SDoHs. The association between model-based NOHSDP and undiagnosed hypertension is concordant with those estimated using self-reported NOHSDP, with a correlation coefficient of 0.649. Similarly, the association between model-based NOHSDP and undiagnosed diabetes is concordant with those estimated using self-reported NOHSDP, with a correlation coefficient of 0.900. The model-based SDoH estimation method offers a scalable and easily standardized approach for estimating individual-level SDoHs. Using the All of Us dataset, we demonstrate reasonable concordance between model-based SDoH estimates and self-reported SDoHs, along with consistent associations with health outcomes. Our findings also underscore the critical role of geographic contexts in SDoH estimation and in evaluating the association between SDoHs and health outcomes.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,"Humans; Social Determinants of Health; United States; Male; Female; Adult; Middle Aged; Diabetes Mellitus; Models, Statistical; Hypertension; Self Report; Aged",False,8

We conducted a cross-sectional study that used data from the All of Us Research Program. We analyzed weight bias among reproductive-aged women aged 18-44 years. Weight bias was assessed using a proxy 7-item survey that evaluated discrimination in health care experiences, including courtesy, respect, service quality, being treated as competent, displaying fear, being treated as inferior, and being listened to during health care visits. Overall, 16,791 reproductive-aged women (mean [SD] age, 35.8 [6.3]) were included in the study. Of 11,592 patients with data available on BMI, 582 were Asian (5.0%), 1,984 (17.1%) were Hispanic or Latinx, 1,007 (8.7%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 7,370 (63.6%) were non-Hispanic White. Approximately 24.2% of participants (n=2,878) had obesity, and 11.1% of participants (n=1,292) had severe obesity. In general, participants in higher BMI categories had negative experiences in the health care setting. Women with severe obesity were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to report poor experiences with their health care clinicians compared with women with healthy weight. Results show significant disparities in the health care experiences among reproductive-aged women. As participants' BMI category increased, so did their negative experiences in the health care setting. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions to address these inequities. Health care systems must prioritize strategies to ensure that all individuals, regardless of weight or BMI, receive equitable and respectful care.",Obstetrics and gynecology,2024,Humans; Female; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Young Adult; Adolescent; Body Mass Index; United States; Social Stigma; Prevalence; Weight Prejudice; Obesity,False,8

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) may further motivate health behaviour change in primary care for lung cancer in diverse populations. In this work, we introduce the GREAT care paradigm, which integrates PRSs within comprehensive patient risk profiles to motivate positive health behaviour changes. We developed PRSs using large-scale multi-ancestry genome-wide association studies and standardised PRS distributions across all ancestries. We validated our PRSs in 561,776 individuals of diverse ancestry from the GISC Trial, UK Biobank (UKBB), and All of Us Research Program (AoU). Significant odds ratios (ORs) for lung cancer and difficulty quitting smoking were observed in both UKBB and AoU. For lung cancer, the ORs for individuals in the highest risk group (top 20% versus bottom 20%) were 1.85 (95% CI: 1.58-2.18) in UKBB and 2.39 (95% CI: 1.93-2.97) in AoU. For difficulty quitting smoking, the ORs (top 33% versus bottom 33%) were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.32-1.41) in UKBB and 1.32 (95% CI: 1.28-1.36) in AoU. Our PRS-based intervention model leverages large-scale genetic data for robust risk assessment across populations, which will be evaluated in two cluster-randomised clinical trials.

This study aimed to describe the sociodemographic characteristics of All of Us participants and evaluate the predictive value of each factor for chronic diseases associated with high morbidity and mortality. We performed a cross-sectional analysis using de-identified survey data from the All of Us Research Program, which has collected social, demographic, and health information from adults living in the United States since May 2018. Sociodemographic data included self-reported age, sex, gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, income, education, health insurance, primary care provider (PCP) status, and health literacy scores. We analyzed the self-reported prevalence of hypertension, coronary artery disease, any cancer, skin cancer, lung disease, diabetes, obesity, and chronic kidney disease. Finally, we assessed the relative importance of each sociodemographic factor for predicting each chronic disease using the adequacy index for each predictor from logistic regression. Among the 372,050 participants in this analysis, the median age was 53 years, 59.8% reported female sex, and the most common racial/ethnic categories were White (54.0%), Black (19.9%), and Hispanic/Latino (16.7%). Participants who identified as Asian, Middle Eastern/North African, and White were the most likely to report annual incomes greater than $200,000, advanced degrees, and employer or union insurance, while participants who identified as Black, Hispanic, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander were the most likely to report annual incomes less than $10,000, less than a high school education, and Medicaid insurance. We found that age was most predictive of hypertension, coronary artery disease, any cancer, skin cancer, diabetes, obesity, and chronic kidney disease. Insurance type was most predictive of lung disease. Notably, no two health conditions had the same order of importance for sociodemographic factors. Age was the best predictor for the assessed chronic diseases, but the relative predictive value of income, education, health insurance, PCP status, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation was highly variable across health conditions. Identifying the sociodemographic groups with the largest disparities in a specific disease can guide future interventions to promote health equity.",BMC public health,2024,"Adult; Humans; Female; Male; United States; Middle Aged; Sociodemographic Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Coronary Artery Disease; Health Promotion; Population Health; Chronic Disease; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Lung Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus; Obesity; Hypertension; Skin Neoplasms",False,0

To describe the association of strabismus with mental health conditions in a diverse cohort of US adults. This cross-sectional study used data from the National Institutes of Health's All of Us Research Program, an ongoing program launched in 2015. The study included 3646 adults (aged ≥18 years) with strabismus and 3646 propensity score-matched controls. Statistical analysis was conducted from September 12, 2023, to January 29, 2024. Adults with strabismus were propensity score matched on age, gender, race and ethnicity, income, educational level, and insurance status in a 1:1 ratio with adults without strabismus. The prevalences of anxiety, depression, substance use and addiction, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia spectrum disorder among adults with strabismus were compared with controls. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of mental health conditions with sociodemographic factors in each group. This study included 3646 adults with strabismus (median age, 67 years [IQR, 53-76 years]; 2017 women [55%]) and 3646 propensity score-matched controls (median age, 67 years [IQR, 53-76 years]; 2017 women [55%]). Individuals with strabismus had higher prevalences of anxiety (1153 [32%] vs 519 [14%]; difference, 17%; 95% CI, 15%-19%; P < .001), depression (1189 [33%] vs 514 [14%]; difference, 19%; 95% CI, 17%-20%; P < .001), substance use and addiction (116 [3%] vs 51 [1%]; difference, 2%; 95% CI, 1%-3%; P < .001), bipolar disorder (253 [7%] vs 101 [3%]; difference, 4%; 95% CI, 3%-5%; P < .001), and schizophrenia spectrum disorder (103 [3%] vs 36 [1%]; difference, 2%; 95% CI, 1%-3%; P < .001) compared with individuals without strabismus. Among adults with strabismus, higher odds of mental health conditions were associated with younger age (odds ratio [OR], 1.11 per 10-year decrease; 95% CI, 1.06-1.16 per 10-year decrease), female gender (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.41-1.85), Black or African American race and ethnicity (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01-1.48), low income (OR, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.56-3.67), and high school education or less (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.34-1.85). In a diverse and nationwide cohort, adults with strabismus were more likely to have mental health conditions compared with adults without strabismus.

Height and weight were measured at baseline, and participants completed questionnaires about demographics, health care access, and quality of life. Women aged 18-50 years with IIH were identified through electronic health record data, excluding those with venous thrombosis, meningitis, hydrocephalus, or central nervous system neoplasms. We used logistic regression to compare questionnaire responses for IIH cases and controls, adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, annual income, and body mass index (BMI). We included 416 women with IIH and 107,111 women without IIH. The mean age was 38 years, and 49.3% identified as non-White. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and BMI, women with IIH were more likely to be unemployed (odds ratio [OR] 1.40, 95% confidential interval [CI]: 1.14-1.71) and report delaying care because of difficulty affording copays (OR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.02-2.10) or specialist care (OR 1.52, 95% CI: 1.06-2.18). They also delayed care because of rural residence (OR 2.08, 95% CI: 1.25-3.47) and transportation limitations (OR 2.23, 95% CI: 1.55-3.20). Although women with IIH were more likely to be non-Hispanic Black (OR 1.66, 95% CI: 1.32-2.09), this association lost significance when controlling for BMI and income (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 0.96-1.68).

All of Us,39243700,Hispanic individuals' cervical cancer screening disparities amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.,"To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cervical cancer screening rates of Hispanic individuals compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals in the United States, whether a responsive surge in catch-up screenings occurred as society adapted to pandemic changes, and to investigate the sociodemographic characteristics between the study populations. Using cross-sectional data from the All of Us Research Program, which incorporates electronic health record data and survey data from a demographically, geographically, and medically diverse participant group, we assessed the annual cervical cancer screening rates during 2019-2021 by race/ethnicity among eligible individuals ages 21-64. Among 116,052 unique individuals (78,829 NHW and 37,223 Hispanic), Hispanic individuals had lower annual cervical cancer screening rates than NHWI across the three years studied. They experienced a more significant decrease in screening from 2019 to 2020 (39.27 %) compared to NHWIs (21.15 %) and less of a rebound increase in the following year, 2021 (10.33 % vs 13.83 %). Hispanic individuals aged 50-64 experienced the sharpest decline in screening rates (-43.01 % from 2019 to 2020). Hispanic individuals also experienced greater adverse social conditions, including lack of insurance or employment, lower educational attainment, and lower household income. Hispanic individuals experienced a more significant decrease in cervical cancer screening rates with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with NHW individuals and did not experience a robust rebound in cervical cancer screening rates in 2021. As a result, the disparity in cervical cancer screening rates between NHW and Hispanic individuals considerably worsened with the COVID-19 pandemic.",Gynecologic oncology,2024,Adult; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Young Adult; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Healthcare Disparities; Hispanic or Latino; United States; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; White,False,2

This study details how the dialogue between scientists and community members, including many from communities of color, shaped local research priorities. We recruited area quantitative, basic, and clinical scientists as well as community members from our Community and Participant Advisory Boards with a predetermined interest in All of Us research as members of a Special Interest Group (SIG). An expert community engagement scientist facilitated 6 SIG meetings over the year, explicitly fostering openness and flexibility during conversations. We qualitatively analyzed discussions using a social movement framework tailored for community-based participatory research (CBPR) mobilization. The SIG evolved through CBPR stages of emergence, coalescence, momentum, and maintenance/integration. Researchers prioritized community needs above personal academic interests while community members kept discussions focused on tangible return of value to communities. One key outcome includes SIG-driven shifts in programmatic and research priorities of the All of Us Research Program in Southeastern Wisconsin. One major challenge was building equitable conversations that balanced scientific rigor and community understanding. Our approach allowed for a rich dialogue to emerge. Points of connection and disconnection between community members and scientists offered important guidance for emerging areas of genomic inquiry.

Yet, the study and use of PRSs in clinical settings raise equity, clinical, and regulatory challenges that can be greater for individuals from historically marginalized racial, ethnic, and other minoritized communities. As part of the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics IV Network, we conducted online focus groups with patients/community members, clinicians, and members of institutional review boards to explore their views on key issues, including PRS research, return of PRS results, clinical translation, and barriers and facilitators to health behavioral changes in response to PRS results. Across stakeholder groups, our findings indicate support for PRS development and a strong interest in having PRS results returned to research participants. However, we also found multi-level barriers and significant differences in stakeholders' views about what is needed and possible for successful implementation. These include researcher-participant interaction formats, health and genomic literacy, and a range of structural barriers, such as financial instability, insurance coverage, and the absence of health-supporting infrastructure and affordable healthy food options in poorer neighborhoods. Our findings highlight the need to revisit and implement measures in PRS studies (e.g., incentives and resources for follow-up care), as well as system-level policies to promote equity in genomic research and health outcomes.",HGG advances,2024,Humans; Genetic Risk Score; Electronic Health Records; Focus Groups,False,1
All of Us,39093943,Sounding out solutions: using SONAR to connect participants with relevant healthcare resources.,"This article outlines a scalable system developed by the All of Us Research Program's Genetic Counseling Resource to vet a large database of healthcare resources for supporting participants with health-related DNA results. After a literature review of established evaluation frameworks for health resources, we created SONAR, a 10-item framework and grading scale for health-related participant-facing resources. SONAR was used to review clinical resources that could be shared with participants during genetic counseling. Application of SONAR shortened resource approval time from 7 days to 1 day. About 256 resources were approved and 8 rejected through SONAR review. Most approved resources were relevant to participants nationwide (60.0%). The most common resource types were related to support groups (20%), cancer care (30.6%), and general educational resources (12.4%). All of Us genetic counselors provided 1161 approved resources during 3005 (38.6%) consults, mainly to local genetic counselors (29.9%), support groups (21.9%), and educational resources (21.0%). SONAR's systematic method simplifies resource vetting for healthcare providers, easing the burden of identifying and evaluating credible resources. Compiling these resources into a user-friendly database allows providers to share these resources efficiently, better equipping participants to complete follow up actions from health-related DNA results. The All of Us Genetic Counseling Resource connects participants receiving health-related DNA results with relevant follow-up resources on a high-volume, national level. This has been made possible by the creation of a novel resource database and validation system.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Humans; Genetic Counseling; United States; Health Resources,False,0

Addressing HI among veterans is a national priority, and greater understanding of differences in HI between veteran and non-veteran populations would inform homeless services and research. We examined six-month prevalence and risk/protective factors associated with self-reported HI among veterans and non-veteran U.S. adults. Cross-sectional data from the All of Us Research Program (AoU) on 254,079 (24,545 veterans and 229,534 non-veterans) survey respondents were analyzed. Logistic regression models were constructed to examine rates of HI, and the association of HI with veteran status as well as demographic, socioeconomic, substance use, and health characteristics. Prevalence rates of HI were 14.9%, 11.5%, and 15.4%, in the general, veteran, and non-veteran populations, respectively. Veteran status was not significantly related to HI, after controlling for confounders. Male sex, middle age, unmarried status, lifetime cigarette smoking, and worse health were associated with greater HI odds, while higher income and health insurance availability were associated with lower HI odds, irrespective of veteran status. Racial disparities in HI were observed among non-veterans only. In addition, among non-veterans, adults who were unemployed or reported any lifetime alcohol consumption were more likely to experience HI, whereas any lifetime use of drugs was associated with lower likelihood of HI. In conclusion, although distinct sociodemographic and clinical correlates of HI were identified, HI did not differ by veteran status in a fully adjusted model.",PloS one,2024,Humans; Male; Veterans; Female; United States; Middle Aged; Adult; Ill-Housed Persons; Cross-Sectional Studies; Housing; Prevalence; Aged; Socioeconomic Factors; Substance-Related Disorders; Risk Factors; Young Adult,False,8
All of Us,38960729,Fair prediction of 2-year stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.,"This study aims to develop machine learning models that provide both accurate and equitable predictions of 2-year stroke risk for patients with atrial fibrillation across diverse racial groups. Our study utilized structured electronic health records (EHR) data from the All of Us Research Program. Machine learning models (LightGBM) were utilized to capture the relations between stroke risks and the predictors used by the widely recognized CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores. We mitigated the racial disparity by creating a representative tuning set, customizing tuning criteria, and setting binary thresholds separately for subgroups. We constructed a hold-out test set that not only supports temporal validation but also includes a larger proportion of Black/African Americans for fairness validation. Compared to the original CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores, significant improvements were achieved by modeling their predictors using machine learning models (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve from near 0.70 to above 0.80). Furthermore, applying our disparity mitigation strategies can effectively enhance model fairness compared to the conventional cross-validation approach. Modeling CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors with LightGBM and our disparity mitigation strategies achieved decent discriminative performance and excellent fairness performance. In addition, this approach can provide a complete interpretation of each predictor. These highlight its potential utility in clinical practice. Our research presents a practical example of addressing clinical challenges through the All of Us Research Program data.

Retrospective cross-sectional METHODS: This study included a cohort of US adults enrolled in the National Institute of Health All of Us Research Program. Individuals who were blind/visually impaired (BVI) were identified via SNONMED codes and compared to a control cohort. Prevalence of baseline, new, and worsened depression and anxiety, as defined by SNONMED codes and medication use were compared between the two groups. Anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 survey, respectively. 324,915 participants, (7,526 BVI individuals and 317,389 controls) were included. BVI individuals had higher prevalence of baseline anxiety and depression (50.4% vs. 28.7%, p<0.001), new anxiety and depression (0.98% vs. 0.66%, p<0.001), and worsened anxiety and depression throughout the COVID-19 pandemic (0.19% vs. 0.07%, p<0.001) compared to controls. Being BVI was significantly associated with baseline and worsened anxiety and depression, after controlling for age, gender, race, ethnicity, and comorbidity (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.61; 95% CI 1.46-1.78, aOR=2.07; 95% CI 1.03-4.13). Similarly, being BVI was associated with a 2.07-point increase on the GAD-7 survey (adjusted beta=2.07; 95% CI 1.32-3.27) and a 2.96-point increase on the PHQ-9 survey (adjusted beta=2.96; 95% CI 1.64-5.36). These findings indicate that BVI individuals are disproportionately affected by anxiety and depression at baseline and throughout the pandemic, highlighting an important need to promote access to mental health services among this population.",Canadian journal of ophthalmology.

All of Us,39254529,Navigating electronic health record accuracy by examination of sex incongruent conditions.,"The increasing reliance on electronic health records (EHRs) for research and clinical care necessitates robust methods for assessing data quality and identifying inconsistencies. To address this need, we develop and apply the incongruence rate (IR) using sex-specific medical conditions. We also characterized participants with incongruent records to better understand the scope and nature of data discrepancies. In this cross-sectional study, we used the All of Us Research Program's latest version 7 (v7) EHR data to identify prevalent sex-specific conditions and evaluated the occurrence of incongruent cases, quantified as IR. Among the 92 597 males and 152 551 females with condition occurrence data available from All of Us and sex-conformed gender, we identified 167 prevalent sex-specific conditions. Among the 37 537 biological males and 95 499 biological females with these sex-specific conditions, we detected an overall IR of 0.86%. Attempt to include non-cisgender participants result in inflated overall IR. Additionally, a significant proportion of participants with incongruent conditions also presented with conditions congruent to their biological sex, indicating a mix of accurate and erroneous records. These incongruences were not geographically or temporally isolated, suggesting systematic issues in EHR data integrity. Our findings call attention to the existence of systemic data incongruences in sex-specific conditions and the need for robust validation checks. Extending IR evaluation to non-cisgender participants or non-sex-based conditions remain a challenge. The sex condition-specific IR, when applied to adult populations, provides a valuable metric for data quality assessment in EHRs.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Humans; Electronic Health Records; Male; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Accuracy; Adult; Middle Aged; Sex Factors; Young Adult; Adolescent; United States; Aged,False,8

Despite its substantial burden, HS remains underdiagnosed and undertreated, particularly among marginalized populations. This study aimed to elucidate the primary social determinants of health (SDOH) and structural determinants of health (StDOH) influencing rates and patterns of screening for patients diagnosed with HS. Using data from the All of Us Research Program database, participants with HS were identified using ICD-10 codes and stratified based on various sociodemographic factors, including race, gender, and income. The primary outcome variables were participation in viral screening and disease screening among HS patients. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the relationship between sociodemographic factors and screening practices. Income and gender had significant impacts on screening practices. Higher-income patients were more likely to receive necessary disease screening and less likely to receive unnecessary disease screening compared to lower-income patients. Non-male patients had significantly higher rates of unnecessary disease and viral screening than male patients. While differences in screening practices within each income level were significant, there were no significant differences across different income brackets or racial groups. These findings suggest that subjectivity associated with individual physicians' recommendations may contribute to disparities in screening outcomes, especially in lower-income and non-male HS patients.

All of Us,39362229,Conversion practice recall and mental health symptoms in sexual and gender minority adults in the USA: a cross-sectional study.,"Conversion practices are associated with psychological morbidity, yet few studies have evaluated differences between efforts to change gender identity, sexual orientation, or both. We aimed to examine the individual and joint association of conversion practice recall targeted at gender identity or sexual orientation, or both, with current mental health symptoms among sexual and gender minority people. This cross-sectional study used data from The PRIDE Study, a US-based, online, prospective cohort study of sexual and gender minority adults who were recruited through social media, digital advertisements, and sexual and gender minority community-based events and organisations. For this analysis, we included participants who completed a lifetime questionnaire in 2019-20 and a subsequent annual questionnaire in 2020-21 without missing outcome data. All questionnaires were in English. The exposure was lifetime recall of conversion practice targeting gender identity alone, sexual orientation alone, or both (versus no conversion practice). Mental health outcomes were continuous measures: Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (depression) scale, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist 6-item scale, and Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised scale. We used linear regression to analyse the associations of conversion practice recall and mental health symptoms, controlling for demographic and childhood factors and stratified between cisgender and transgender and gender diverse groups. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the potential impact of unmeasured confounding. Analyses were conducted in R. We included people with related lived experience in the design and implementation of this study. Of 6601 participants who completed the lifetime questionnaire in 2019-20, 4440 completed the subsequent annual questionnaire in 2020 or 2021, and 4426 did not have missing outcome data. Of the 4426 included participants, 4073 (92·0%) identified as White (either alone or in combination with other ethnoracial options), 460 (10·4%) identified with multiple ethnoracial identities, and 1923 (43·4%) were transgender and gender diverse. Participants' age ranged from 18 years to 84 years (median 31·7 years, IQR 25·5-44·1). 149 (3·4%) participants reported sexual orientation-related conversion practice alone, 43 (1·0%) reported gender identity-related conversion practice alone, and 42 (1·0%) reported both. Recalling both forms of conversion practice was most strongly associated with greater post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; β 2·84, 95% CI 0·94-4·74) and suicidality (2·14, 0·95-3·32) symptoms. Recall of only sexual orientation-related conversion practice was associated with greater symptoms of PTSD (1·10, 0·22-1·98). Recall of gender identity-related conversion practice alone was most strongly associated with greater depressive symptoms (3·24, 1·03-5·46). Only associations for suicidality differed between cisgender and transgender and gender diverse participants, although the latter showed higher mental health symptoms overall. Findings were moderately robust to potential sources of unmeasured confounding in sensitivity analysis. Recall of conversion practice exposure was associated with a range of mental health symptoms among sexual and gender minority people. These findings support calls to ban conversion practices because of their effects as a structural determinant of mental health.

This cross-sectional study used a national sample from the All of Us Research Program, which included over 80 % of participants from underrepresented populations in biomedical research. Study participants included adults aged 18 years and older diagnosed with OSA (N = 8518). Diagnosis of OSA and CPAP treatment were ascertained by diagnostic and procedural codes from the electronic health records. Sociodemographic characteristics and health service utilization factors were identified using self-reported survey data. With this national survey, the overall diagnosed prevalence of OSA was 8.8 %, with rates of 8.12 % in non-Hispanic (NH) Black adults, 5.99 % in Hispanic adults, and 10.35 % in NH White adults. When comparing to NH White adults, Hispanic adults were less likely to receive CPAP treatment for OSA after adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, access to and utilization of health services, and comorbidities such as obesity and having multiple chronic conditions (OR = 0.73, 95 % CI = 0.59,0.90), p < 0.01. The rates of CPAP treatment among OSA patients are not consistent across racial and ethnic groups. Unequal access to health services based on residence may contribute to these differences.

All of Us,39325459,The Key Features of a Genetic Nondiscrimination Policy: A Delphi Consensus Statement.,"Governments worldwide have become increasingly cognizant of the spread of genetic discrimination (negative treatment or harm on the basis of actual or presumed genetic characteristics). Despite efforts by a number of governments to establish regulations addressing this phenomenon, public concern about genetic discrimination persists. To identify key elements of an optimal genetic nondiscrimination policy and inform policymakers as they seek to allay genetic nondiscrimination and related public anxieties. Sixty multidisciplinary experts from 20 jurisdictions worldwide were consulted to understand their views on effective genetic nondiscrimination policies. Following standard requirements of the Delphi method, 3 rounds of surveys over the course of 1.5 years were conducted. Round 1 focused on assessing participants' understanding of the intricacies of existing genetic nondiscrimination policies, while rounds 2 and 3 invited participants to reflect on specific means of implementing a more effective regime. A total of 60 respondents participated in the first round, 53 participated in round 2, and 43 participated in round 3. While responses varied across disciplines, there was consensus that binding regulations that reach across various sectors are most useful in preventing genetic discrimination. Overall, experts agreed that human rights-based approaches are well suited to preventing genetic discrimination. Experts also agreed that explicit prohibition of genetic discrimination within nondiscrimination policies can highlight the importance of genetic nondiscrimination as a fundamental right and ensure robust protection at a national level. While most participants believed the international harmonization of genetic nondiscrimination laws would facilitate data sharing worldwide, they also recognized that regulations must reflect the sociocultural differences that exist among regions. As the reach of genetic discrimination continues to evolve alongside developments in genomics, strategic policy responses that are harmonious at the international and state levels will be critical to address this phenomenon. In seeking to establish comprehensive frameworks, policymakers will need to be mindful of regional and local circumstances that influence the need for and efficacy of unique genetic nondiscrimination approaches across diverse contexts.",JAMA network open,2024,Humans; Delphi Technique; Consensus; Genetic Privacy; Health Policy; Social Discrimination; Prejudice,False,0

All of Us,39177194,Implementing a pragmatic clinical trial to tailor opioids for chronic pain on behalf of the IGNITE ADOPT PGx investigators.,"Chronic pain is a prevalent condition with enormous economic burden. Opioids such as tramadol, codeine, and hydrocodone are commonly used to treat chronic pain; these drugs are activated to more potent opioid receptor agonists by the hepatic CYP2D6 enzyme. Results from clinical studies and mechanistic understandings suggest that CYP2D6-guided therapy will improve pain control and reduce adverse drug events. However, CYP2D6 is rarely used in clinical practice due in part to the demand for additional clinical trial evidence. Thus, we designed the ADOPT-PGx (A Depression and Opioid Pragmatic Trial in Pharmacogenetics) chronic pain study, a multicenter, pragmatic, randomized controlled clinical trial, to assess the effect of CYP2D6 testing on pain management. The study enrolled 1048 participants who are taking or being considered for treatment with CYP2D6-impacted opioids for their chronic pain. Participants were randomized to receive immediate or delayed (by 6 months) genotyping of CYP2D6 with clinical decision support (CDS). CDS encouraged the providers to follow the CYP2D6-guided trial recommendations. The primary study outcome is the 3-month absolute change in the composite pain intensity score assessed using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures.

All of Us,39138951,"Balancing efficacy and computational burden: weighted mean, multiple imputation, and inverse probability weighting methods for item non-response in reliable scales.","Scales often arise from multi-item questionnaires, yet commonly face item non-response. Traditional solutions use weighted mean (WMean) from available responses, but potentially overlook missing data intricacies. Advanced methods like multiple imputation (MI) address broader missing data, but demand increased computational resources. Researchers frequently use survey data in the All of Us Research Program (All of Us), and it is imperative to determine if the increased computational burden of employing MI to handle non-response is justifiable. Using the 5-item Physical Activity Neighborhood Environment Scale (PANES) in All of Us, this study assessed the tradeoff between efficacy and computational demands of WMean, MI, and inverse probability weighting (IPW) when dealing with item non-response. Synthetic missingness, allowing 1 or more item non-response, was introduced into PANES across 3 missing mechanisms and various missing percentages (10%-50%). Each scenario compared WMean of complete questions, MI, and IPW on bias, variability, coverage probability, and computation time. All methods showed minimal biases (all <5.5%) for good internal consistency, with WMean suffered most with poor consistency. IPW showed considerable variability with increasing missing percentage. MI required significantly more computational resources, taking >8000 and >100 times longer than WMean and IPW in full data analysis, respectively. The marginal performance advantages of MI for item non-response in highly reliable scales do not warrant its escalated cloud computational burden in All of Us, particularly when coupled with computationally demanding post-imputation analyses. Researchers using survey scales with low missingness could utilize WMean to reduce computing burden.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,"Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires; Probability; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Exercise",False,9

The aim was to identify ticagrelor-responsive platelet transcripts as biomarkers of platelet function and cardiovascular risk. Healthy volunteers (n=58, discovery; n=49, validation) were exposed to 4 weeks of ticagrelor with platelet RNA data, platelet function, and self-reported bleeding measured pre-/post-ticagrelor. RNA sequencing was used to discover platelet genes affected by ticagrelor, and a subset of the most informative was summarized into a composite score and tested for validation. This score was further analyzed (1) in CD34+ megakaryocytes exposed to an P2Y12 inhibitor in vitro, (2) with baseline platelet function in healthy controls, (3) in peripheral artery disease patients (n=139) versus patient controls (n=30) without atherosclerosis, and (4) in patients with peripheral artery disease for correlation with atherosclerosis severity and risk of incident major adverse cardiovascular and limb events. Ticagrelor exposure differentially expressed 3409 platelet transcripts. Of these, 111 were prioritized to calculate a Ticagrelor Exposure Signature score, which ticagrelor reproducibly increased in discovery and validation cohorts. Ticagrelor's effects on platelets transcripts positively correlated with effects of P2Y12 inhibition in primary megakaryocytes. In healthy controls, higher baseline scores correlated with lower baseline platelet function and with minor bleeding while receiving ticagrelor. In patients, lower scores independently associated with both the presence and extent of atherosclerosis and incident ischemic events. Ticagrelor-responsive platelet transcripts are a biomarker for platelet function and cardiovascular risk and may have clinical utility for selecting patients with optimal risk:benefit for ticagrelor use.","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2024,Humans; Ticagrelor; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Clopidogrel; Purinergic P2Y Receptor Antagonists; Adenosine; Hemorrhage; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Biomarkers; Treatment Outcome; Acute Coronary Syndrome,False,0

Research and development of DHT-related devices, platforms, and applications is happening rapidly and with significant private-sector involvement with new biotech companies and large tech companies (e.g. Google, Apple, Amazon, Uber) investing heavily in technologies to improve human health. Many academic institutions are building capabilities related to DHT research, often in cross-sector collaboration with technology companies and other organizations with the goal of generating clinically meaningful evidence to improve patient care, to identify users at an earlier stage of disease presentation, and to support health preservation and disease prevention. Large research consortia, cross-sector partnerships, and individual research labs are all represented in the current corpus of published studies. Some of the large research studies, like NIH's All of Us Research Program, make data sets from wearable sensors available to the research community, while the vast majority of data from wearable sensors and other DHTs are held by private sector organizations and are not readily available to the research community. As data are unlocked from the private sector and made available to the academic research community, there is an opportunity to develop innovative analytics and methods through expanded access. This is the second year for this Session which solicited research results leveraging digital health technologies, including wearable sensor data, describing novel analytical methods, and issues related to diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI) of the research, data, and the community of researchers working in this area.

The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between multidisciplinary cancer consultations and receipt of guideline-recommended adjuvant treatments among breast, colorectal, or non-small cell lung cancer patients and assess these associations between and within racial and ethnic groups. This is a population-based retrospective cohort study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), Medicare-linked data (2006-2016) to identify Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast, colorectal, or non-small cell lung cancer. Multidisciplinary cancer consultation was based on encounters with 2 or more oncology providers within 2 months of diagnosis. Cancer quality metrics assessed included receipt of guideline-recommended adjuvant cancer treatment for each cancer type. Patients with multidisciplinary cancer consultations were more likely to receive adjuvant cancer treatment compared with patients without multidisciplinary cancer consultations within racial and ethnic groups. However, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic breast cancer patients with multidisciplinary cancer consultations were 24% and 41% less likely to receive hormone and radiation therapy, respectively, compared with NHWs with multidisciplinary cancer consultations. Patients with multidisciplinary cancer consultations were more likely to receive adjuvant cancer treatment, but racial and ethnic disparities in cancer care persist. Multidisciplinary cancer consultations are likely an important, but not fully sufficient, contributor to the receipt of adjuvant cancer treatment and may be a tool in the implementation of multipronged, team-based cancer care delivery models to reduce inequities in cancer-related outcomes.",American journal of clinical oncology,2024,"Humans; Female; Retrospective Studies; Referral and Consultation; Male; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; United States; SEER Program; Aged, 80 and over; Colorectal Neoplasms; Lung Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Medicare; Quality of Health Care; Neoplasms; Patient Care Team",False,0
All of Us,39666044,"Association between non-melanoma skin cancer, psoriasis, and immunomodulatory therapy: a national epidemiologic study.","The association between psoriasis and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) remains inconsistent despite biologic plausibility. Immunosuppressive effects of systemic psoriasis treatments have also been hypothesized to contribute to the development of NMSC as well. However, data assessing the risk of NMSC associated with immunomodulatory psoriasis medications, particularly newer biologic therapies, are limited.Our objective was to quantify the association between psoriasis, systemic psoriasis therapy, and NMSC accounting for other relevant factors such as smoking status and ultraviolet (UV) light exposure.We performed a cross-sectional, case-control study of 413,457 adults containing 7,478 psoriasis and 9,756 NMSC cases taken from the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program database (queried July 2024). NMSC, psoriasis, UV-light exposure, and drug exposures were defined using disease or drug classification codes. Smoking exposure was defined using survey data. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess relationships, providing adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (aOR with 95% CI).After adjustment for UV-light exposure, coal tar exposure, smoking status, race, ethnicity, gender, age, income, and insurance status, psoriasis history was a significant predictor for NMSC (aOR 1.37 95% CI 1.22-1.52). Psoriasis patients exposed to immunomodulatory medications were also at higher odds of NMSC compared to psoriasis patients who were never exposed (aOR 1.26 95% CI 1.01-1.57). Of these drugs, IL-23 inhibitors (aOR 2.47 95% CI 1.17-5.18), Janus kinase inhibitors (aOR 2.32 95% CI 1.09-4.92), and azathioprine (aOR 2.16 95% CI 1.18-3.96) were the only classes that significantly contributed to increased NMSC risk in psoriasis patients.Psoriasis is independently associated with NMSC. While treatment with some classes of systemic medications is also associated with increased NMSC risk, therapeutic benefits are significant and should be weighed against this risk. NMSC is treatable and high-risk patients may benefit from increased surveillance or preventative counseling.

Guided by the Smerecnik framework that theorizes understanding of multifactorial genetic disease through 3 knowledge types, we developed English and Spanish infographics for individuals enrolled in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network. Infographics were developed to explain concepts in lay language and visualizations. We conducted iterative sessions using a modified ""think-aloud"" process with 10 participants (6 English, 4 Spanish-speaking) to explore comprehension of and attitudes towards the infographics. We found that all but one participant had ""awareness knowledge"" of genetic disease risk factors upon viewing the infographics. Many participants had difficulty with ""how-to"" knowledge of applying genetic risk factors to specific monogenic and polygenic risks. Participant attitudes towards the iteratively-refined infographics indicated that design saturation was reached. There were several elements that contributed to the participants' comprehension (or misunderstanding) of the infographics. Visualization and iconography techniques best resonated with those who could draw on prior experiences or knowledge and were absent in those without. Limited graphicacy interfered with the understanding of absolute and relative risks when presented in graph format.

We aimed to characterize patterns of early uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among cancer survivors and to determine modifiable barriers to vaccine completion that can be addressed to ensure future booster adherence. Cross-sectional data of vaccine uptake by summer 2021 was extracted from adult cancer survivors enrolled in the ""All of Us"" research program. Vaccine completion was determined based on receiving at least two doses. We assessed sociodemographic factors, socioeconomic barriers (education, income, health insurance status, housing, and employment status), and COVID-19 vaccine uptake by Summer 2021, employing multivariable ordinal logistic regression for those who were unvaccinated, had initiated vaccine uptake, and had completed COVID-19 vaccination. Of the 514 cancer survivors in the sample, 73.7% were fully vaccinated by summer 2021. Those who received no vaccine doses showed higher proportions of SES barriers, medical distrust, and perceived lack of need barriers. Race (non-Hispanic White vs. other) was not statistically significantly associated with vaccine uptake (OR (95% CI) = 0.94 (0.51, 1.70)), while for every additional SES barrier, there was a 40% decrease (OR (95% CI) = 0.60 (0.48, 0.75)) in the odds of receiving more COVID-19 vaccine doses. Higher medical distrust and perceived lack of need were associated with 56% (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.32-0.59) and 39% (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.43-0.87) lower odds, respectively.

All of Us,38583580,Discovering clinical drug-drug interactions with known pharmacokinetics mechanisms using spontaneous reporting systems and electronic health records.,"Although the mechanisms behind pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are well-documented, bridging the gap between this knowledge and clinical evidence of DDIs, especially for serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs), remains challenging. While leveraging the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database along with disproportionality analysis tends to detect a vast number of DDI signals, this abundance complicates further investigation, such as validation through clinical trials. Our study proposed a framework to efficiently prioritize these signals and assessed their reliability using multi-source Electronic Health Records (EHR) to identify top candidates for further investigation. We analyzed FAERS data spanning from January 2004 to March 2023, employing four established disproportionality methods: Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS), and Bayesian Confidence Propagating Neural Network (BCPNN). Building upon these models, we developed four ranking models to prioritize DDI-SADR signals and cross-referenced signals with DrugBank. To validate the top-ranked signals, we employed longitudinal EHRs from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the All of Us research program. The performance of each model was assessed by counting how many of the top-ranked signals were confirmed by EHRs and calculating the average ranking of these confirmed signals. Out of 189 DDI-SADR signals identified by all four disproportionality methods, only two were documented in the DrugBank database. By prioritizing the top 20 signals as determined by each of the four disproportionality methods and our four ranking models, 58 unique DDI-SADR signals were selected for EHR validations. Of these, five signals were confirmed. The ranking model, which integrated the MGPS and BCPNN, demonstrated superior performance by assigning the highest priority to those five EHR-confirmed signals. The fusion of disproportionality analysis with ranking models, validated through multi-source EHRs, presents a groundbreaking approach to pharmacovigilance. Our study's confirmation of five significant DDI-SADRs, previously unrecorded in the DrugBank database, highlights the essential role of advanced data analysis techniques in identifying ADRs.",Journal of biomedical informatics,2024,"Electronic Health Records; Humans; Drug Interactions; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Bayes Theorem; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration; Databases, Factual; Neural Networks, Computer; Pharmacokinetics; Reproducibility of Results",False,1

All of Us,39786404,Alcohol Use Disorder Polygenic Score Compared With Family History and ADH1B.,"Identification of individuals at high risk of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and subsequent application of prevention and intervention programs has been reported to decrease the incidence of AUD. The polygenic score (PGS), which measures an individual's genetic liability to a disease, can potentially be used to evaluate AUD risk. To assess the estimability and generalizability of the PGS, compared with family history and ADH1B, in evaluating the risk of AUD among populations of European ancestry. This genetic association study was conducted between October 1, 2023, and May 21, 2024. A 2-stage design was used. First, the pruning and thresholding method was used to calculate PGSs in the screening stage. Second, the estimability and generalizability of the best PGS was determined using 2 independent samples in the testing stage. Three cohorts ascertained to study AUD were used in the screening stage: the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE), and the Australian Twin-Family Study of Alcohol Use Disorder (OZALC). The All of Us Research Program (AOU), which comprises participants with diverse backgrounds and conditions, and the Indiana Biobank (IB), consisting of Indiana University Health system patients, were used to test the best PGS. For the COGA, SAGE, and OZALC cohorts, cases with AUD were determined using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) or Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria; controls did not meet any criteria or did not have any other substance use disorders. For the AOU and IB cohorts, cases with AUD were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes; controls were aged 21 years or older and did not have AUD. The PGS was calculated using single-nucleotide variants with concordant effects in 3 large-scale genome-wide association studies of AUD-related phenotypes. The main outcome was AUD determined with DSM-IV or DSM-5 criteria and ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes. Generalized linear mixed models and logistic regression models were used to analyze related and unrelated samples, respectively. The COGA, SAGE, and OZALC cohorts included a total of 8799 samples (6323 cases and 2476 controls; 50.6% were men). The AOU cohort had a total of 116 064 samples (5660 cases and 110 404 controls; 60.4% were women). The IB cohort had 6373 samples (936 cases and 5437 controls; 54.9% were women). The 5% of samples with the highest PGS in the AOU and IB cohorts were approximately 2 times more likely to develop AUD (odds ratio [OR], 1.96 [95% CI, 1.78-2.16]; P = 4.10 × 10-43; and OR, 2.07 [95% CI, 1.59-2.71]; P = 9.15 × 10-8, respectively) compared with the remaining 95% of samples; these ORs were comparable to family history of AUD. For the 5% of samples with the lowest PGS in the AOU and IB cohorts, the risk of AUD development was approximately half (OR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.45-0.62]; P = 6.98 × 10-15; and OR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.39-0.84]; P = 4.88 × 10-3) compared with the remaining 95% of samples; these ORs were comparable to the protective effect of ADH1B. PGS had similar estimabilities in male and female individuals. In this study of AUD risk among populations of European ancestry, PGSs were calculated using concordant single-nucleotide variants and the best PGS was tested in targeted datasets. The findings suggest that the PGS may potentially be used to evaluate AUD risk.

In adults, MC is commonly spread by sexual contact, and is self-limited in patients with intact immune systems but more widely distributed and difficult to treat in immunocompromised persons. We analyzed cases of adult MC for associations with immunosuppression, lifestyle risk factors, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Using the All of Us Research Program database, adults with MC were identified and matched with controls 1:10 based on demographic factors.

Classification of anemia using the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) can help investigate the underlying causative factors of anemia. We characterize anemia using MCV among PWH receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and identify the risk factors for normocytic, macrocytic, and microcytic anemias. Including PWH with anemia (hemoglobin measure < 12.9 g/dL among men and < 11.9 g/dL among women) in the NA-ACCORD from 01/01/2007 to 12/31/2017, we estimated the annual distribution of normocytic (80-100 femtolitre (fL)), macrocytic (> 100 fL) or microcytic (< 80 fL) anemia based on the lowest hemoglobin within each year. Poisson regression models with robust variance and general estimating equations were used to estimate crude and adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for risk factors for macrocytic (vs. normocytic) and microcytic (vs. normocytic) anemia stratified by sex. Among 37,984 hemoglobin measurements that identified anemia in 14,590 PWH, 27,909 (74%) were normocytic, 4257 (11%) were microcytic, and 5818 (15%) were macrocytic. Of the anemic PWH included over the study period, 1910 (13%) experienced at least one measure of microcytic anemia and 3208 (22%) at least one measure of macrocytic anemia. Normocytic anemia was most common among both males and females, followed by microcytic among females and macrocytic among males. Over time, the proportion of anemic PWH who have macrocytosis decreased while microcytosis increased. Macrocytic (vs. normocytic) anemia is associated with increasing age and comorbidities. With increasing age, microcytic anemia decreased among females but not males. A greater proportion of PWH with normocytic anemia had CD4 counts  In anemic PWH, normocytic anemia was most common. Over time macrocytic anemia decreased, and microcytic anemia increased irrespective of sex. Normocytic anemia is often due to chronic disease and may explain the greater risk for normocytic anemia among those with lower CD4 counts or recent ART initiation.

To determine the impact of SIV infection on underlying cause of death, we retrospectively analyzed data from 307 SMs (219 SIV infected and 88 uninfected) housed at the Emory Primate Center that have died between 1986 and 2022. Interestingly, we found that SIV-infected SMs live ~4 years longer than SIV-uninfected SMs, although this result is hard to interpret due to differences in how animals were housed and assigned to specific experimental studies. While the causes of death were not different between SIV-infected and uninfected SMs that died before age 15 (i.e., adult), we found significant differences in the relative frequency of specific causes of death in the elderly population (≥15 years old). Specifically, we observed that SIV-infected SMs were more likely to die from infections but less likely to die from cardiovascular disease (and diabetes in female animals) as compared to uninfected SMs. While confirming the non-pathogenic nature of SIV infection in SMs, these data reveal, for the first time, a qualitative impact of SIV infection on the host physiology that induces a significant change in the mortality pattern in these natural SIV hosts. In this study, we demonstrate, for the first time, that the natural, non-pathogenic SIV infection of the African monkey SM has a clinical impact which is revealed in terms of main causes of mortality, which are significantly different in the infected animals as compared to the uninfected ones. Indeed, SIV-infected SMs are at higher risk of dying of infectious diseases but appear to be somewhat protected from cardiovascular causes of death. The identification of a specific pattern of mortality associated with the infection suggests that the host-pathogen interaction between SIV and the SM immune system, while non-pathogenic in nature, has a detectable impact on the overall health status of the animals.",mBio,2024,Animals; Cercocebus atys; Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Simian Immunodeficiency Virus; Female; Male; Cause of Death; Retrospective Studies,False,0
All of Us,38245684,Access to healthcare among transgender women living with and without HIV in the United States: associations with gender minority stress and resilience factors.,"Transgender women (TW) experience significant inequities in healthcare access and health disparities compared to cisgender populations. Access to non-transition related healthcare is understudied among TW. We aimed to assess the association between access to care and gender minority stress and resilience factors among TW living with and without HIV in eastern and southern United States. This study was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data drawn from a cohort of 1613 adult TW from the LITE Study. The cohort permitted participation through two modes: a site-based, technology-enhanced mode and an exclusively online (remote) mode. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses determined measurement models for gender minority stress, resilience, and healthcare access. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the relationships between these constructs. Models were evaluated within the overall sample and separately by mode and HIV status. Higher levels of gender minority stress, as measured by anticipated discrimination and non-affirmation were associated with decreased access to healthcare. Among TW living with HIV, higher levels of anticipated discrimination, non-affirmation, and social support were associated with decreased healthcare access. Among TW living without HIV in the site-based mode, resilience was positively associated with positive healthcare experiences and inversely associated with barriers to healthcare access. Among TW living without HIV in the online mode, anticipated discrimination was associated with barriers to healthcare access; resilience was positively associated with positive healthcare experiences and inversely associated with barriers to healthcare access. Gender minority stress was associated with increased barriers to healthcare access among TW in the US, regardless of HIV status. Resilience factors did not mediate this effect. Interventions aiming to increase healthcare access among TW can be aided by efforts to mitigate drivers of gender minority stress and improve patient experiences in healthcare facilities.",BMC public health,2024,"Adult; Humans; United States; Female; Transgender Persons; Cross-Sectional Studies; Resilience, Psychological; HIV Infections; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Health Services Accessibility; Gender Identity; Male",False,4
All of Us,39666613,"Pathogen class-specific transcriptional responses derived from PBMCs accurately discriminate between fungal, bacterial, and viral infections.","Immune responses during acute infection often contain canonical elements which are shared across the responses to an array of agents within a given pathogen class (i.e., respiratory viral infection). Identification of these shared, canonical elements across similar infections offers the potential for impacting development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics. In this way, analysis of host gene expression patterns ('signatures') in white blood cells has been shown to be useful for determining the etiology of some acute viral and bacterial infections. In order to study conserved immune elements shared across the host response to related pathogens, we performed in vitro human PBMC challenges with common fungal pathogens (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and gattii); four strains of influenza virus (Influenza A/Puerto Rico/08/34 [H1N1, PR8], A/Brisbane/59/2007 [H1N1], A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 [H1N1], and A/Wisconsin/67/2005 [H3N2]); and gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and gram-positive (Streptococcus pneumoniae) bacteria. Exposed human cells were then analyzed for differential gene expression utilizing Affymetrix microarrays. Analysis of pathogen exposure of PBMCs revealed strong, conserved gene expression patterns representing these canonical immune response elements to each broad pathogen class. A 41-gene multinomial signature was developed which correctly classified fungal, viral, or bacterial exposure with 94-98% accuracy. Furthermore, a 21-gene signature consisting of a subset of the discriminatory PBMC-derived genes was capable of accurately differentiating human patients with invasive candidiasis, acute viral infection, or bacterial infection (AUC 0.94, 0.83, and 0.96 respectively). These data reinforce the conserved nature of the genomic responses in human peripheral blood cells upon exposure to infectious agents and highlight the potential for in vitro models to augment our ability to develop novel diagnostic classifiers for acute infectious diseases, particularly devastating fungal infections.",PloS one,2024,"Humans; Mycoses; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Bacterial Infections; Virus Diseases; Gene Expression Profiling; Transcription, Genetic",False,5
All of Us,39118208,The Association of Anemia With Survival Among People With HIV Following Antiretroviral Initiation in the NA-ACCORD 2007-2016.,"Anemia is an independent predictor of mortality, which may be utilized as a signal of deteriorating health. We estimated the association between anemia severity categories and mortality following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among people with HIV (PWH) in North America. Within the NA-ACCORD, annual median hemoglobin measurements between January 01, 2007, and December 31, 2016, were categorized using World Health Organization criteria into mild (11.0-12.9 g/dL men, 11.0-11.9 g/dL women), moderate (8.0-10.9 g/dL men/women), and severe (<8.0 g/dL men/women) anemia. Discrete time-to-event analyses using complementary log-log link models estimated mortality hazard ratios adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and HIV clinical markers with 95% confidence intervals for the association between anemia and mortality. Among 67,228 PWH contributing a total of 320,261 annual median hemoglobin measurements, 257,293 (80%) demonstrated no anemia, 44,041 (14%) mild, 18,259 (6%) moderate, and 668 (0.2%) severe anemia during follow-up. Mortality risk was 5.6-fold higher among PWH with (vs. without) anemia. The association was greater among men (adjusted hazard ratios = 5.8 [5.4, 6.2]) versus women (adjusted hazard ratios = 4.1 [3.2, 5.4]). Mortality risk was 3.8-fold higher among PWH with mild anemia, 13.7-fold higher with moderate anemia, and 34.5-fold higher with severe anemia (vs. no anemia). Median hemoglobin levels decreased significantly in the 4 years before death, with a maximum decrease in the year before death. Macrocytic anemia was associated with an increased mortality risk and microcytic anemia was associated with a decreased mortality risk (vs. normocytic anemia). Anemia among PWH who have initiated ART is an important predictive marker for mortality with macrocytic anemia having an increased association and microcytic anemia having a decreased association with mortality compared with normocytic anemia.",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),2024,Humans; Anemia; HIV Infections; Male; Female; Adult; Middle Aged; Anti-HIV Agents; Hemoglobins; North America,False,8
All of Us,38498589,Long-term HIV care outcomes under universal HIV treatment guidelines: A retrospective cohort study in 25 countries.,"While national adoption of universal HIV treatment guidelines has led to improved, timely uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART), longer-term care outcomes are understudied. There is little data from real-world service delivery settings on patient attrition, viral load (VL) monitoring, and viral suppression (VS) at 24 and 36 months after HIV treatment initiation. For this retrospective cohort analysis, we used observational data from 25 countries in the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) consortium's Asia-Pacific, Central Africa, East Africa, Central/South America, and North America regions for patients who were ART naïve and aged ≥15 years at care enrollment between 24 months before and 12 months after national adoption of universal treatment guidelines, occurring 2012 to 2018. We estimated crude cumulative incidence of loss-to-clinic (CI-LTC) at 12, 24, and 36 months after enrollment among patients enrolling in care before and after guideline adoption using competing risks regression. Guideline change-associated hazard ratios of LTC at each time point after enrollment were estimated via cause-specific Cox proportional hazards regression models. Modified Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks of retention, VL monitoring, and VS at 12, 24, and 36 months after ART initiation. There were 66,963 patients enrolling in HIV care at 109 clinics with ≥12 months of follow-up time after enrollment (46,484 [69.4%] enrolling before guideline adoption and 20,479 [30.6%] enrolling afterwards). More than half (54.9%) were females, and median age was 34 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 27 to 43). Mean follow-up time was 51 months (standard deviation: 17 months; range: 12, 110 months). Among patients enrolling before guideline adoption, crude CI-LTC was 23.8% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 23.4, 24.2) at 12 months, 31.0% (95% CI [30.6, 31.5]) at 24 months, and 37.2% (95% [CI 36.8, 37.7]) at 36 months after enrollment. Adjusting for sex, age group, enrollment CD4, clinic location and type, and country income level, enrolling in care and initiating ART after guideline adoption was associated with increased hazard of LTC at 12 months (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.25 [95% CI 1.08, 1.44]; p = 0.003); 24 months (aHR 1.38 [95% CI 1.19, 1.59]; p < .001); and 36 months (aHR 1.34 [95% CI 1.18, 1.53], p < .001) compared with enrollment before guideline adoption, with no before-after differences among patients with no record of ART initiation by end of follow-up. Among patients retained after ART initiation, VL monitoring was low, with marginal improvements associated with guideline adoption only at 12 months after ART initiation. Among those with VL monitoring, VS was high at each time point among patients enrolling before guideline adoption (86.0% to 88.8%) and afterwards (86.2% to 90.3%), with no substantive difference associated with guideline adoption. Study limitations include lags in and potential underascertainment of care outcomes in real-world service delivery data and potential lack of generalizability beyond IeDEA sites and regions included in this analysis. In this study, adoption of universal HIV treatment guidelines was associated with lower retention after ART initiation out to 36 months of follow-up, with little change in VL monitoring or VS among retained patients. Monitoring long-term HIV care outcomes remains critical to identify and address causes of attrition and gaps in HIV care quality.",PLoS medicine,2024,Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Anti-HIV Agents; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Cohort Studies; HIV Infections; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Observation; Adolescent,False,2
All of Us,40417537,Deep Learning-based Time-to-event Analysis of Depression and Asthma using the All of Us Research Program.,"While there is a growing recognition of the association between depression and asthma, few studies have leveraged deep learning-based (DL-based) models in a retrospective cohort study with a large sample size. We analyzed the association between depression and asthma among 239,161 participants of the All of Us Research Program through DL-based, logistic regression, and Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) models. We used SHAP values to help interpret DL-based models and c-index to evaluate model performance. Results suggest a significant odds ratio for depression in asthma. The c-indices for the CoxPH, DeepSurv, and DeepHit models were 0.619, 0.625, and 0.596, respectively. SHAP indicated a different set of important variables when compared with the CoxPH model. In conclusion, we provide strong evidence of a positive relationship between depression and asthma. Also, DL-based models did not outperform the CoxPH model on the c-index. Sex at birth and income may play important roles in occurrence of depression in asthma patients.",AMIA ... Annual Symposium proceedings.

All of Us,40417568,EHR Phenotyping Methods for Measuring Treatment Adherence Among People Living With HIV in All of Us: Towards Disparities and Inequalities in HIV Care Continuum.,"HIV treatment adherence is among the most important determinants of HIV outcomes. However, only 50% of people living with HIV in the US were retained in care. Measuring HIV treatment adherence in the clinical settings is feasible but when it comes to the growing number of multi-site Electronic Health Records (EHR), there has been a dearth of research for adequate informatics methods to handle EHR. We sought to address this gap by developing a cluster of metrics for measuring HIV treatment adherence via EHR phenotyping methods. Our methods were developed and tested in the All of Us research program. We also performed preliminary analyses to explore disparities in HIV treatment adherence and demographic factors contributing to poor adherence. This study paves the way for systematic data mining and analyses for the HIV care continuum, disparities, and inequality research on All of Us and other EHR normalized with the OMOP Common Data Model.",AMIA ...

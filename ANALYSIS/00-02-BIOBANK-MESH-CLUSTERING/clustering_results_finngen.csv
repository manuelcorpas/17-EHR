FinnGen,31551469,Genetic architecture of human plasma lipidome and its link to cardiovascular disease.,"Understanding genetic architecture of plasma lipidome could provide better insights into lipid metabolism and its link to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Here, we perform genome-wide association analyses of 141 lipid species (n = 2,181 individuals), followed by phenome-wide scans with 25 CVD related phenotypes (n = 511,700 individuals).

FinnGen,31367044,Exome sequencing of Finnish isolates enhances rare-variant association power.,"Exome-sequencing studies have generally been underpowered to identify deleterious alleles with a large effect on complex traits as such alleles are mostly rare. Because the population of northern and eastern Finland has expanded considerably and in isolation following a series of bottlenecks, individuals of these populations have numerous deleterious alleles at a relatively high frequency. Here, using exome sequencing of nearly 20,000 individuals from these regions, we investigate the role of rare coding variants in clinically relevant quantitative cardiometabolic traits. Exome-wide association studies for 64 quantitative traits identified 26 newly associated deleterious alleles. Of these 26 alleles, 19 are either unique to or more than 20 times more frequent in Finnish individuals than in other Europeans and show geographical clustering comparable to Mendelian disease mutations that are characteristic of the Finnish population. We estimate that sequencing studies of populations without this unique history would require hundreds of thousands to millions of participants to achieve comparable association power.",Nature,2019,"Alleles; Cholesterol, HDL; Cluster Analysis; Endpoint Determination; Finland; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Geographic Mapping; Humans; Multifactorial Inheritance; Quantitative Trait Loci; Reproducibility of Results; Exome Sequencing",False,8

FinnGen,33275596,"Evaluating the relationship between alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and cardiovascular disease: A multivariable Mendelian randomization study.","Alcohol consumption and smoking, 2 major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), often occur together. The objective of this study is to use a wide range of CVD risk factors and outcomes to evaluate potential total and direct causal roles of alcohol and tobacco use on CVD risk factors and events. Using large publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWASs) (results from more than 1.2 million combined study participants) of predominantly European ancestry, we conducted 2-sample single-variable Mendelian randomization (SVMR) and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) to simultaneously assess the independent impact of alcohol consumption and smoking on a wide range of CVD risk factors and outcomes. Multiple sensitivity analyses, including complementary Mendelian randomization (MR) methods, and secondary alcohol consumption and smoking datasets were used. SVMR showed genetic predisposition for alcohol consumption to be associated with CVD risk factors, including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (beta 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.04-0.47, P value = 1.72 × 10-28), triglycerides (TRG) (beta -0.23, 95% CI, -0.30, -0.15, P value = 4.69 × 10-10), automated systolic blood pressure (BP) measurement (beta 0.11, 95% CI, 0.03-0.18, P value = 4.72 × 10-3), and automated diastolic BP measurement (beta 0.09, 95% CI, 0.03-0.16, P value = 5.24 × 10-3). Conversely, genetically predicted smoking was associated with increased TRG (beta 0.097, 95% CI, 0.014-0.027, P value = 6.59 × 10-12). Alcohol consumption was also associated with increased myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary heart disease (CHD) risks (MI odds ratio (OR) = 1.24, 95% CI, 1.03-1.50, P value = 0.02; CHD OR = 1.21, 95% CI, 1.01-1.45, P value = 0.04); however, its impact was attenuated in MVMR adjusting for smoking. Conversely, alcohol maintained an association with coronary atherosclerosis (OR 1.02, 95% CI, 1.01-1.03, P value = 5.56 × 10-4). In comparison, after adjusting for alcohol consumption, smoking retained its association with several CVD outcomes including MI (OR = 1.84, 95% CI, 1.43, 2.37, P value = 2.0 × 10-6), CHD (OR = 1.64, 95% CI, 1.28-2.09, P value = 8.07 × 10-5), heart failure (HF) (OR = 1.61, 95% CI, 1.32-1.95, P value = 1.9 × 10-6), and large artery atherosclerosis (OR = 2.4, 95% CI, 1.41-4.07, P value = 0.003). Notably, using the FinnGen cohort data, we were able to replicate the association between smoking and several CVD outcomes including MI (OR = 1.77, 95% CI, 1.10-2.84, P value = 0.02), HF (OR = 1.67, 95% CI, 1.14-2.46, P value = 0.008), and peripheral artery disease (PAD) (OR = 2.35, 95% CI, 1.38-4.01, P value = 0.002). The main limitations of this study include possible bias from unmeasured confounders, inability of summary-level MR to investigate a potentially nonlinear relationship between alcohol consumption and CVD risk, and the generalizability of the UK Biobank (UKB) to other populations. Evaluating the widest range of CVD risk factors and outcomes of any alcohol consumption or smoking MR study to date, we failed to find a cardioprotective impact of genetically predicted alcohol consumption on CVD outcomes. However, alcohol was associated with and increased HDL-C, decreased TRG, and increased BP, which may indicate pathways through impact CVD risk, warranting further study. We found smoking to be a risk factor for many CVDs even after adjusting for alcohol. While future studies incorporating alcohol consumption patterns are necessary, our data suggest causal inference between alcohol, smoking, and CVD risk, further supporting that lifestyle modifications might be able to reduce overall CVD risk.",PLoS medicine,2020,"Alcohol Drinking; Cardiovascular Diseases; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Multivariate Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Assessment; Tobacco Use",False,2

FinnGen,32154731,Polygenic Hyperlipidemias and Coronary Artery Disease Risk.,"Hyperlipidemia is a highly heritable risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). While monogenic familial hypercholesterolemia associates with severely increased CAD risk, it remains less clear to what extent a high polygenic load of a large number of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (LDL-C) or triglyceride (TG)-increasing variants associates with increased CAD risk. We derived polygenic risk scores (PRSs) with ≈6M variants separately for LDL-C and TG with weights from a UK Biobank-based genome-wide association study with ≈324K samples. We evaluated the impact of polygenic hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia to lipid levels in 27 039 individuals from the National FINRISK Study (FINRISK) cohort and to CAD risk in 135 638 individuals (13 753 CAD cases) from the FinnGen project (FinnGen). In FINRISK, median LDL-C was 3.39 (95% CI, 3.38-3.40) mmol/L, and it ranged from 2.87 (95% CI, 2.82-2.94) to 3.78 (95% CI, 3.71-3.83) mmol/L between the lowest and highest 5% of the LDL-C PRS distribution. Median TG was 1.19 (95% CI, 1.18-1.20) mmol/L, ranging from 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94-1.00) to 1.55 (95% CI, 1.48-1.61) mmol/L with the TG PRS. In FinnGen, comparing the highest 5% of the PRS to the lowest 95%, CAD odds ratio was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.24-1.49) for the LDL-C PRS and 1.31 (95% CI, 1.19-1.43) for the TG PRS. These estimates were only slightly attenuated when adjusting for a CAD PRS (odds ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.16-1.38] for LDL-C and 1.24 [95% CI, 1.13-1.36] for TG PRS). The CAD risk associated with a high polygenic load for lipid-increasing variants was proportional to their impact on lipid levels and partially overlapping with a CAD PRS. In contrast with a PRS for CAD, the lipid PRSs point to known and directly modifiable risk factors providing additional guidance for clinical translation.",Circulation.

FinnGen,32277175,Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies novel loci associated with age-related macular degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among the elderly population. To accelerate the understanding of the genetics of AMD, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) combining data from the International AMD Genomics Consortium AMD-2016 GWAS (16,144 advanced AMD cases and 17,832 controls), AMD-2013 GWAS (17,181 cases and 60,074 controls), and new data on 4017 AMD cases and 14,984 controls from Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging study. We identified 12 novel AMD loci near or within C4BPA-CD55, ZNF385B, ZBTB38, NFKB1, LINC00461, ADAM19, CPN1, ACSL5, CSK, RLBP1, CLUL1, and LBP. We then replicated the associations of the novel loci in independent cohorts, UK Biobank (5860 cases and 126,726 controls) and FinnGen (1266 cases and 47,560 control). In general, the concordance in effect sizes was very high (correlation in effect size estimates 0.89), 11 of 12 novel loci were in the expected direction, 5 were associated with AMD at a nominal significance level, and rs3825991 (near gene RLBP1) after Bonferroni correction. We identified an additional 21 novel genes using a gene-based test. Most of the novel genes are expressed in retinal tissue and could be involved in the pathogenesis of AMD (i.e., complement, inflammation, and lipid pathways).

FinnGen,33310085,Association of Genetic Variation With Cirrhosis: A Multi-Trait Genome-Wide Association and Gene-Environment Interaction Study.,"In contrast to most other common diseases, few genetic variants have been identified that impact risk of cirrhosis. We aimed to identify new genetic variants that predispose to cirrhosis, to test whether such variants, aggregated into a polygenic score, enable genomic risk stratification, and to test whether alcohol intake or body mass index interacts with polygenic predisposition. We conducted a multi-trait genome-wide association study combining cirrhosis and alanine aminotransferase levels performed in 5 discovery studies (UK Biobank, Vanderbilt BioVU, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, and 2 case-control studies including 4829 individuals with cirrhosis and 72,705 controls and 362,539 individuals with alanine aminotransferase levels).

FinnGen,33261611,"Genetically proxied milk consumption and risk of colorectal, bladder, breast, and prostate cancer: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.","Observational studies have shown that milk consumption is inversely associated with colorectal, bladder, and breast cancer risk, but positively associated with prostate cancer. However, whether the associations reflect causality remains debatable. We investigated the potential causal associations of milk consumption with the risk of colorectal, bladder, breast, and prostate cancer using a genetic variant near the LCT gene as proxy for milk consumption. We obtained genetic association estimates for cancer from the UK Biobank (n = 367,643 women and men), FinnGen consortium (n = 135,638 women and men), Breast Cancer Association Consortium (n = 228,951 women), and Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome consortium (n = 140,254 men). Milk consumption was proxied by a genetic variant (rs4988235 or rs182549) upstream of the gene encoding lactase, which catalyzes the breakdown of lactose. Genetically proxied milk consumption was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. The odds ratio (OR) for each additional milk intake increasing allele was 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-0.99; P = 0.009). There was no overall association of genetically predicted milk consumption with bladder (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.94-1.05; P = 0.836), breast (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00-1.02; P = 0.113), and prostate cancer (OR 1.01; 95% CI 0.99-1.02; P = 0.389), but a positive association with prostate cancer was observed in the FinnGen consortium (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01-1.13; P = 0.026). Our findings strengthen the evidence for a protective role of milk consumption on colorectal cancer risk.

FinnGen,33382884,HeartBioPortal2.0: new developments and updates for genetic ancestry and cardiometabolic quantitative traits in diverse human populations.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide for all genders and across most racial and ethnic groups. However, different races and ethnicities exhibit different rates of CVD and its related cardiorenal and metabolic comorbidities, suggesting differences in genetic predisposition and risk of onset, as well as socioeconomic and lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, etc.) that act upon an individual's unique underlying genetic background. Here, we present HeartBioPortal2.0, a major update to HeartBioPortal, the world's largest CVD genetics data precision medicine platform for harmonized CVD-relevant genetic variants, which now enables search and analysis of human genetic information related to heart disease across ethnically diverse populations and cardiovascular/renal/metabolic quantitative traits pertinent to CVD pathophysiology. HeartBioPortal2.0 is structured as a cloud-based computing platform and knowledge portal that consolidates a multitude of CVD-relevant genomic data modalities into a single powerful query and browsing interface between data and user via a user-friendly web application publicly available to the scientific research community. Since its initial release, HeartBioPortal2.0 has added new cardiovascular/renal/metabolic disease-relevant gene expression data as well as genetic association data from numerous large-scale genome-wide association study consortiums such as CARDIoGRAMplusC4D, TOPMed, FinnGen, AFGen, MESA, MEGASTROKE, UK Biobank, CHARGE, Biobank Japan and MyCode, among other studies. In addition, HeartBioPortal2.0 now includes support for quantitative traits and ethnically diverse populations, allowing users to investigate the shared genetic architecture of any gene or its variants across the continuous cardiometabolic spectrum from health (e.g. blood pressure traits) to disease (e.g. hypertension), facilitating the understanding of CVD trait genetics that inform health-to-disease transitions and endophenotypes. Custom visualizations in the new and improved user interface, including performance enhancements and new security features such as user authentication, collectively re-imagine HeartBioPortal's user experience and provide a data commons that co-locates data, storage and computing infrastructure in the context of studying the genetic basis behind the leading cause of global mortality.

FinnGen,32369491,Rare protein-altering variants in ANGPTL7 lower intraocular pressure and protect against glaucoma.,"Protein-altering variants that are protective against human disease provide in vivo validation of therapeutic targets. Here we use genotyping data from UK Biobank (n = 337,151 unrelated White British individuals) and FinnGen (n = 176,899) to conduct a search for protein-altering variants conferring lower intraocular pressure (IOP) and protection against glaucoma. Through rare protein-altering variant association analysis, we find a missense variant in ANGPTL7 in UK Biobank (rs28991009, p.Gln175His, MAF = 0.8%, genotyped in 82,253 individuals with measured IOP and an independent set of 4,238 glaucoma patients and 250,660 controls) that significantly lowers IOP (β = -0.53 and -0.67 mmHg for heterozygotes, -3.40 and -2.37 mmHg for homozygotes, P = 5.96 x 10-9 and 1.07 x 10-13 for corneal compensated and Goldman-correlated IOP, respectively) and is associated with 34% reduced risk of glaucoma (P = 0.0062). In FinnGen, we identify an ANGPTL7 missense variant at a greater than 50-fold increased frequency in Finland compared with other populations (rs147660927, p.Arg220Cys, MAF Finland = 4.3%), which was genotyped in 6,537 glaucoma patients and 170,362 controls and is associated with a 29% lower glaucoma risk (P = 1.9 x 10-12 for all glaucoma types and also protection against its subtypes including exfoliation, primary open-angle, and primary angle-closure). We further find three rarer variants in UK Biobank, including a protein-truncating variant, which confer a strong composite lowering of IOP (P = 0.0012 and 0.24 for Goldman-correlated and corneal compensated IOP, respectively), suggesting the protective mechanism likely resides in the loss of interaction or function.

FinnGen,32895727,An atlas on risk factors for type 2 diabetes: a wide-angled Mendelian randomisation study.,"The aim of this study was to use Mendelian randomisation (MR) to identify the causal risk factors for type 2 diabetes. We first conducted a review of meta-analyses and review articles to pinpoint possible risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Around 170 possible risk factors were identified of which 97 risk factors with available genetic instrumental variables were included in MR analyses. To reveal more risk factors that were not included in our MR analyses, we conducted a review of published MR studies of type 2 diabetes. For our MR analyses, we used summary-level data from the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis consortium (74,124 type 2 diabetes cases and 824,006 controls of European ancestry). Potential causal associations were replicated using the FinnGen consortium (11,006 type 2 diabetes cases and 82,655 controls of European ancestry). The inverse-variance weighted method was used as the main analysis. Multivariable MR analysis was used to assess whether the observed associations with type 2 diabetes were mediated by BMI. We used the Benjamini-Hochberg method that controls false discovery rate for multiple testing. We found evidence of causal associations between 34 exposures (19 risk factors and 15 protective factors) and type 2 diabetes. Insomnia was identified as a novel risk factor (OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.11, 1.23]). The other 18 risk factors were depression, systolic BP, smoking initiation, lifetime smoking, coffee (caffeine) consumption, plasma isoleucine, valine and leucine, liver alanine aminotransferase, childhood and adulthood BMI, body fat percentage, visceral fat mass, resting heart rate, and four plasma fatty acids. The 15 exposures associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes were plasma alanine, HDL- and total cholesterol, age at menarche, testosterone levels, sex hormone binding globulin levels (adjusted for BMI), birthweight, adulthood height, lean body mass (for women), four plasma fatty acids, circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and education years. Eight associations remained after adjustment for adulthood BMI. We additionally identified 21 suggestive risk factors (p < 0.05), such as alcohol consumption, breakfast skipping, daytime napping, short sleep, urinary sodium, and certain amino acids and inflammatory factors. The present study verified several previously reported risk factors and identified novel potential risk factors for type 2 diabetes.

FinnGen,33110245,An expanded analysis framework for multivariate GWAS connects inflammatory biomarkers to functional variants and disease.,"Multivariate methods are known to increase the statistical power to detect associations in the case of shared genetic basis between phenotypes. They have, however, lacked essential analytic tools to follow-up and understand the biology underlying these associations. We developed a novel computational workflow for multivariate GWAS follow-up analyses, including fine-mapping and identification of the subset of traits driving associations (driver traits). Many follow-up tools require univariate regression coefficients which are lacking from multivariate results. Our method overcomes this problem by using Canonical Correlation Analysis to turn each multivariate association into its optimal univariate Linear Combination Phenotype (LCP). This enables an LCP-GWAS, which in turn generates the statistics required for follow-up analyses. We implemented our method on 12 highly correlated inflammatory biomarkers in a Finnish population-based study. Altogether, we identified 11 associations, four of which (F5, ABO, C1orf140 and PDGFRB) were not detected by biomarker-specific analyses. Fine-mapping identified 19 signals within the 11 loci and driver trait analysis determined the traits contributing to the associations.

The purpose of this study was to investigate possible causal associations between dietary-derived circulating antioxidants and primary CHD risk using 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms for circulating antioxidants (vitamins E and C, retinol, β-carotene, and lycopene), assessed as absolute levels and metabolites, were retrieved from the published data and were used as genetic instrumental variables. Summary statistics for gene-CHD associations were obtained from 3 databases: the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (60,801 cases; 123,504 control subjects), UK Biobank (25,306 cases; 462,011 control subjects), and FinnGen study (7,123 cases; 89,376 control subjects). For each exposure, MR analyses were performed per outcome database and were subsequently meta-analyzed. Among an analytic sample of 768,121 individuals (93,230 cases), genetically predicted circulating antioxidants were not causally associated with CHD risk.

We use gene-based tests, colocalization, genetic correlation, latent causal variable (LCV) and polygenic prediction in an independent Australian sample (N = 5595) to draw insights into the etiology of pneumonia risk. We identify two independent loci on chromosome 15 (lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs2009746 and rs76474922) to be associated with pneumonia (p < 5e-8). Gene-based tests revealed 18 genes in chromosomes 15, 16 and 9, including IL127, PBX3, ApoB receptor (APOBR) and smoking related genes CHRNA3/5, statistically associated with pneumonia. We observed genetic correlations between pneumonia and cardiorespiratory, psychiatric and inflammatory related traits.

We conducted this study to compare the effects of overall and abdominal obesity on venous thromboembolism (VTE) and to calculate population attributable fraction for obesity for VTE. Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were used to represent overall and abdominal obesity, respectively. In the cohort study, we included 74317 Swedish adults with anthropometric measures in 1997 and of whom 4332 were diagnosed with VTE until the end of 2017. A Mendelian randomization study was conducted to investigate causal associations of BMI, WC, and WC adjusted for BMI with VTE using data from FinnGen and UK Biobank study. Population attributable fraction was calculated for overall and abdominal obesity for VTE. In the cohort study, there were dose-response associations of BMI and WC with VTE. The association between BMI and VTE was attenuated largely after adjusting for WC. Among individuals with normal BMI, participants with substantially increased WC had 53% higher (hazard ratio 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.28, 1.81) risk of VTE compared to those with normal WC. The causality of the association of WC adjusted for BMI with VTE was confirmed in Mendelian randomization analysis.

FinnGen,32895918,Sleep duration and risk of overall and 22 site-specific cancers: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Studies of sleep duration in relation to the risk of site-specific cancers other than breast cancer are scarce. Furthermore, the available results are inconclusive and the causality remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the potential causal associations of sleep duration with overall and site-specific cancers using the Mendelian randomization (MR) design. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the sleep traits identified from a genome-wide association study were used as instrumental variables to estimate the association with overall cancer and 22 site-specific cancers among 367 586 UK Biobank participants. A replication analysis was performed using data from the FinnGen consortium (up to 121 579 individuals). There was suggestive evidence that genetic liability to short-sleep duration was associated with higher odds of cancers of the stomach (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-4.30; P = .018), pancreas (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.32-3.62; P = .002) and colorectum (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.12-1.95; P = .006), but with lower odds of multiple myeloma (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.22-0.99; P = .047). Suggestive evidence of association of genetic liability to long-sleep duration with lower odds of pancreatic cancer (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.79; P = .005) and kidney cancer (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.90; P = .025) was observed. However, none of these associations passed the multiple comparison threshold and two-sample MR analysis using FinnGen data did not confirm these findings. In conclusion, this MR study does not provide strong evidence to support causal associations of sleep duration with risk of overall and site-specific cancers. Further MR studies are required.",International journal of cancer,2021,"Adult; Aged; Biological Specimen Banks; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Odds Ratio; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Sleep; Time Factors; United Kingdom",False,0
FinnGen,34597274,Age-dependent impact of the major common genetic risk factor for COVID-19 on severity and mortality.,"BackgroundThere is considerable variability in COVID-19 outcomes among younger adults, and some of this variation may be due to genetic predisposition.MethodsWe combined individual level data from 13,888 COVID-19 patients (n = 7185 hospitalized) from 17 cohorts in 9 countries to assess the association of the major common COVID-19 genetic risk factor (chromosome 3 locus tagged by rs10490770) with mortality, COVID-19-related complications, and laboratory values. We next performed metaanalyses using FinnGen and the Columbia University COVID-19 Biobank.ResultsWe found that rs10490770 risk allele carriers experienced an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7). Risk allele carriers had increased odds of several COVID-19 complications: severe respiratory failure (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.6), venous thromboembolism (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4), and hepatic injury (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0). Risk allele carriers age 60 years and younger had higher odds of death or severe respiratory failure (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.8-3.9) compared with those of more than 60 years (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8; interaction, P = 0.038). Among individuals 60 years and younger who died or experienced severe respiratory failure, 32.3% were risk-variant carriers compared with 13.9% of those not experiencing these outcomes. This risk variant improved the prediction of death or severe respiratory failure similarly to, or better than, most established clinical risk factors.ConclusionsThe major common COVID-19 genetic risk factor is associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality, which are more pronounced among individuals 60 years or younger. The effect was similar in magnitude and more common than most established clinical risk factors, suggesting potential implications for future clinical risk management.",The Journal of clinical investigation,2021,"Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alleles; COVID-19; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Loci; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acuity; Polymorphism, Genetic; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2",False,0

In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the UK Biobank, we analyzed the genomes of 1,363 individuals with AAA compared to 27,260 age, ancestry, and sex-matched controls (1:20 case:control study design). A similar analysis was repeated for 435 individuals with TAA compared to 8,700 controls. Polymorphism with minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.5% were evaluated. We identified novel loci near LINC01021, ATOH8 and JAK2 genes that achieved genome-wide significance for AAA (p-value <5x10-8), in addition to three known loci. For TAA, three novel loci in CTNNA3, FRMD6 and MBP achieved genome-wide significance. There was no overlap in the genes associated with AAAs and TAAs. Additionally, we identified a linkage group of high-frequency variants (MAFs ~10%) encompassing FBN1, the causal gene for Marfan syndrome, which was associated with TAA. In FinnGen PheWeb, this FBN1 haplotype was associated with aortic dissection. Finally, we found that baseline bradycardia was associated with TAA, but not AAA. Our GWAS found that AAA and TAA were associated with distinct sets of genes, suggesting distinct underlying genetic architecture. We also found association between baseline bradycardia and TAA. These findings, including JAK2 association, offer plausible mechanistic and therapeutic insights. We also found a common FBN1 linkage group that is associated with TAA and aortic dissection in patients who do not have Marfan syndrome.

The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants that represent new targets for gallstone research and treatment. We performed a GWAS of 28,627 gallstone cases and 348,373 controls in the UK Biobank, replicated findings in a Scottish cohort (1089 cases, 5228 controls), and conducted a GWA meta-analysis (43,639 cases, 506,798 controls) with the FinnGen cohort. We assessed pathway enrichment using gene-based then gene-set analysis and tissue expression of identified genes in Genotype-Tissue Expression project data. We constructed a polygenic risk score (PRS) and evaluated phenotypic traits associated with the score. Seventy-five risk loci were identified (p < 5 × 10 This GWAS demonstrates the polygenic nature of gallstone risk and identifies 46 novel susceptibility loci.

While hypercortisolism may be associated with AF, this association has not yet been ascertained causally. To determine whether plasma cortisol is causally associated with AF using a 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design. Three genetic variants in the SERPINA1/SERPINA6 locus and functionally associated with plasma cortisol were identified in the CORtisol NETwork consortium (12 597 participants). Summary-level genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for the associations between the cortisol-associated variants and AF were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis of 6 studies (60 620 AF cases and 970 216 noncases) and the FinnGen consortium (17 325 AF cases and 97 214 noncases). The fixed-effects inverse-variance weighted approach accounting for genetic correlations between variants was used for analysis. Multivariable MR analyses were conducted to assess potential mediating effects of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and waist circumference (WC). Summary-level GWAS data for SBP and WC were obtained respectively from the International Consortium of Blood Pressure (757 601 participants) and the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits consortium (232 101 participants). One standard deviation increase in genetically predicted plasma cortisol was associated with greater risk of AF (odds ratio [OR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.35).

FinnGen,34643165,The validity of rheumatoid arthritis diagnoses in Finnish biobanks.,"The aim of this study was to determine the validity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnoses in patients participating in Finnish biobanks. We reviewed the electronic medical records of 500 Finnish biobank participants: 125 patients with at least one visit with a diagnosis of seropositive RA, 125 patients with at least one visit with a diagnosis of seronegative RA, and 250 age- and gender-matched controls. The patients were chosen from five different biobank hospitals in Finland. A rheumatologist reviewed the medical records to assess whether each patients' diagnosis was correct. The diagnosis was compared with the diagnostic codes in the Finnish Care Register for Health Care (CRHC) and special reimbursement data of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. The positive predictive value (PPV) of CRHC diagnosis of RA (for seropositive and seronegative RA combined) was 0.82. For patients with a special reimbursement for anti-rheumatic medications for RA, the PPV was 0.89. The PPV was higher in patients with more than one visit. For one, two, five, and 10 visits, the PPV was 0.82, 0.85, 0.89, and 0.90, respectively, and for patients who also had the special reimbursement, the PPV was 0.89, 0.91, 0.93, and 0.94 for one, two, five, and 10 visits, respectively. In patients positive for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, the PPV was 0.98. These results demonstrate that the validity of RA diagnoses in Finnish biobanks was good and can be further improved by including data on special reimbursement for medication, number of visits, and serological data.",Scandinavian journal of rheumatology,2023,"Humans; Finland; Biological Specimen Banks; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Antirheumatic Agents; Predictive Value of Tests; Rheumatoid Factor",False,8

FinnGen,33611940,Polygenic Risk Scores Predict Hypertension Onset and Cardiovascular Risk.,"Although genetic risk scores have been used to predict hypertension, their utility in the clinical setting remains uncertain. Our study comprised N=218 792 FinnGen participants (mean age 58 years, 56% women) and N=22 624 well-phenotyped FINRISK participants (mean age 50 years, 53% women). We used public genome-wide association data to compute polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP). Using time-to-event analysis, we then assessed (1) the association of BP PRSs with hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in FinnGen and (2) the improvement in model discrimination when combining BP PRSs with the validated 4- and 10-year clinical risk scores for hypertension and CVD in FINRISK. In FinnGen, compared with having a 20 to 80 percentile range PRS, a PRS in the highest 2.5% conferred 2.3-fold (95% CI, 2.2–2.4) risk of hypertension and 10.6 years (95% CI, 9.9–11.4) earlier hypertension onset. In subgroup analyses, this risk was only 1.6-fold (95% CI, 1.5–1.7) for late-onset hypertension (age ≥55 years) but 2.8-fold (95% CI, 2.6–2.9) for early-onset hypertension (age <55 years). Elevated systolic BP PRS also conferred 1.3-fold (95% CI, 1.2–1.4) risk of CVD and 2.3 years (95% CI, 1.6–3.1) earlier onset. In FINRISK, systolic and diastolic BP PRSs improved clinical risk prediction of hypertension (but not CVD), increasing the C statistics by 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3–1.1). We demonstrate that genetic information improves hypertension risk prediction. BP PRSs together with traditional risk factors could improve prediction of hypertension and particularly early-onset hypertension, which confers substantial CVD risk.","Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",2021,Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Finland; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Multifactorial Inheritance; Patient-Specific Modeling; Predictive Value of Tests; Preventive Health Services; Risk Factors,False,0

Polymorphisms in the WRB (rs2244352) and TSPAN10 (rs6420484) genes were investigated in individuals from the FinnGen study group who had one of three categories of strabismus, with clinical diagnoses of (1) ""strabismus-all subtypes"" (3,515 cases and 173,384 controls), (2) ""convergent concomitant strabismus"" (ICD-10 code H50.0; 737 cases and 170,976 controls), and (3) ""divergent concomitant strabismus"" (ICD-10 code H50.1; 1,059 cases and 170,976 controls). The WRB polymorphism was associated with ""all subtypes"" of strabismus (OR = 1.08; P = 0.008) and divergent strabismus (OR = 1.11; P = 0.046) but not with convergent strabismus (P = 0.41). The WRB polymorphism had a population attributable risk of 3.4% for all strabismus subtypes and 4.7% for divergent strabismus.

To define the genetic basis of spastic CP. Whole-genome data were obtained using the multi-ethnic genotyping array (MEGA) genotyping array capturing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.01, and imputation quality score (r2) > 0.3, imputed based on the 1000 genomes phase 3 reference panel.

It is the most common MYOC risk variant for glaucoma among individuals of European ancestry, and its prevalence is highest in Finland. Furthermore, exfoliation syndrome has high prevalence in Scandinavia, making the Finnish population ideal to study the association of the variant with different types of glaucoma. To examine the association and penetrance of MYOC p.(Gln368Ter) (rs74315329) variant with different types of glaucoma in a Finnish population. This genetic association study included individuals of Finnish ancestry in the FinnGen project. The participants were collected from Finnish biobanks, and the disease end points were defined using nationwide registries. The MYOC c.1102C>T variant was either directly genotyped or imputed with microarrays. Recruitment of samples to FinnGen was initiated in 2017, and data analysis was performed between December 2019 and May 2020. The main outcomes were odds ratios (ORs) and penetrance with different types of glaucoma and in different age groups. A total of 218 792 individuals were included in this study (mean [SD] age 52.4 [17.5] years; 123 579 women [56.5%]), including 8591 (3.9%) with glaucoma, 3412 (1.6%) with primary open-angle glaucoma, 1515 (0.7%) with exfoliation glaucoma, 892 (0.4%) with normal-tension glaucoma, and 4766 (2.2%) with suspected glaucoma. The minor allele frequency of MYOC p.(Gln368Ter) was 0.28%. Individuals with the heterozygous variant had higher odds of primary open-angle glaucoma (OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 2.55-4.37), overall glaucoma (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 2.12-3.13), suspected glaucoma (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.93-3.26), exfoliation glaucoma (OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.60-4.02), and undergoing glaucoma-related operations (OR, 5.45; 95% CI, 2.95-9.28). The penetrance of heterozygous MYOC p.(Gln368Ter) was 5.2% in individuals with primary open-angle glaucoma, 9.6% in individuals with glaucoma, 5.4% in individuals with suspected glaucoma, and 1.9% in individuals with exfoliation glaucoma. There was no significant association with normal-tension glaucoma (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 0.72-3.35). This genetic association study found that the MYOC p.(Gln368Ter) variant was associated with exfoliation glaucoma. The association with normal-tension glaucoma could not be replicated.

For example, we showed that sex exhibits artifactual autosomal heritability in the presence of sex-differential participation bias. By performing a genome-wide association study of sex in approximately 3.3 million males and females, we identified over 158 autosomal loci spuriously associated with sex and highlighted complex traits underpinning differences in study participation between the sexes.

FinnGen,33608734,Mendelian randomization highlights insomnia as a risk factor for pain diagnoses.,"Insomnia has been linked to acute and chronic pain conditions; however, it is unclear whether such relationships are causal. Recently, a large number of genetic variants have been discovered for both insomnia and pain through genome-wide association studies (GWASs) providing a unique opportunity to examine the evidence for causal relationships through the use of the Mendelian randomization paradigm. To elucidate the causality between insomnia and pain, we performed bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis in FinnGen, where clinically diagnosed ICD-10 categories of pain had been evaluated. In addition, we used measures of self-reported insomnia symptoms. We used endpoints for pain in the FinnGen Release 5 (R5) (N = 218,379), and a non-overlapping sample for insomnia (UK Biobank (UKBB) and 23andMe, N = 1,331,010 or UKBB alone N = 453,379). We assessed the robustness of results through conventional Mendelian randomization sensitivity analyses. Genetic liability to insomnia symptoms increased the odds of reporting pain (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.47 [1.38-1.58], p = 4.12 × 10-28). Manifested pain had a small effect on increased risk for insomnia (OR [95% CI] = 1.04 [1.01-1.07], p < 0.05). Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses. Our findings support a bidirectional causal relationship between insomnia and pain.

FinnGen,33818779,Educational attainment protects against epilepsy independent of cognitive function: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies have suggested that increased levels of education and cognition are associated with a reduced risk of epilepsy. However, such associations are easily influenced by confounding or reverse causality. Hence, we conducted a two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the total and independent causal effects of educational attainment and cognition on epilepsy risk. We performed MR estimates on International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Consortium genome-wide association study (GWAS) data (15 212 epilepsy cases and 29 677 controls). We then validated the results in FinnGen (3424 epilepsy cases and 110 963 controls) and applied meta-analysis to all the results. In the meta-analysis of the ILAE and FinnGen results, genetically determined increased educational attainment was associated with a reduced risk of epilepsy (odds ratio [OR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-0.88; P < .001). Similarly, genetically determined increased cognitive function was associated with a reduced risk of epilepsy (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88-1.00, P = .043). When educational attainment and cognitive function were included in the same multivariable MR, only educational attainment was still associated with a reduced risk of epilepsy (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.95, P = .002).

Family aggregation studies and heritability estimates suggest a significant inherited genetic component. Candidate gene studies and previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) report associations between the HLA region and cervical cancer. Adopting a genome-wide approach, we aimed to compare genetic variation in women with invasive cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 with that in healthy controls. We did a GWAS in a cohort of unrelated European individuals using data from UK Biobank, a population-based cohort including 273 377 women aged 40-69 years at recruitment between March 13, 2006, and Oct 1, 2010. We used an additive univariate logistic regression model to analyse genetic variants associated with invasive cervical cancer or CIN3. We sought replication of candidate associations in FinnGen, a large independent dataset of 128 123 individuals. We also did a two-sample mendelian randomisation approach to explore the role of risk factors in the genetic risk of cervical cancer. We included 4769 CIN3 and invasive cervical cancer case samples and 145 545 control samples in the GWAS.

FinnGen,34459406,Genetically Predicted Coffee Consumption and Risk of Alzheimer's Disease and Stroke.,"Observational studies have reported that coffee consumption was associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and stroke risk. However, the results are inconclusive. We aimed to evaluate whether genetically predicted coffee consumption is associated with AD and stroke using Mendelian randomization (MR) design. Summary-level data for AD (n = 54,162), ischemic stroke (n = 440,328), and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH, n = 3,026) were adopted from publicly available databases. Summary-level data for coffee consumption were obtained from two genome-wide association studies, comprising up to 375,833 subjects. Genetically predicted coffee consumption (cups/day) was associated with an increased risk of AD (OR = 1.26, 95%CI = 1.05-1.51). Moreover, genetically predicted 50%increase of coffee consumption was associated with an increased risk of ICH (OR: 2.27, 95%CI: 1.08-4.78) but a decreased risk of small vessel stroke (OR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.51-0.996). Estimate for AD and ICH in FinnGen consortium is directionally consistent. Combined analysis of different databases further confirmed that genetically predicted coffee consumption was associated with an increased risk of AD and ICH. In the multivariable MR analysis, genetically predicted coffee consumption retained a stable effect with AD and ICH when adjusting for smoking (p < 0.05), while the association with AD attenuated when adjusting for alcohol use.

Here we studied the genetic association between APOE and COVID-19 in Finnish biobank, autopsy and prospective clinical cohort datasets. In line with previous work, our data on 2611 cases showed that APOE4 carriership associates with severe COVID-19 in intensive care patients compared with non-infected population controls after matching for age, sex and cardiovascular disease status. Histopathological examination of brain autopsy material of 21 COVID-19 cases provided evidence that perivascular microhaemorrhages are more prevalent in APOE4 carriers. Finally, our analysis of post-COVID fatigue in a prospective clinical cohort of 156 subjects revealed that APOE4 carriership independently associates with higher mental fatigue compared to non-carriers at six months after initial illness. In conclusion, the present data on Finns suggests that APOE4 is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 and post-COVID mental fatigue and provides the first indication that some of this effect could be mediated via increased cerebrovascular damage.

However, detection of the C9exp requires elaborative methods. Identification of C9exp carriers from genotyped cohorts could be facilitated by using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as markers for the C9exp. We elucidated the potential of the previously described Finnish risk haplotype, defined by the SNP rs3849942, to identify potential C9exp carriers among 218,792 Finns using the FinnGen database. The haplotype approach was first tested in an idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patient cohort (European Alzheimer's Disease DNA BioBank) containing C9exp carriers by comparing intermediate (15-30) and full-length (> 60 repeats) C9exp carriers (n = 41) to C9exp negative patients (< 15 repeats, n = 801). In this analysis, rs3849942 was associated with carriership of C9exp (OR 8.44, p < 2×10-15), while the strongest association was found with rs139185008 (OR 39.4, p < 5×10-18).

Our objective was to identify PTVs that were associated with both lipid levels and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) and assess their possible associations with risks of other diseases. To achieve this aim, we leveraged the enrichment of PTVs in the Finnish population and tested the association of low-frequency PTVs in 1,209 genes with serum lipid levels in the Finrisk Study (n = 23,435). We then tested which of the lipid-associated PTVs were also associated with the risks of T2D or CAD, as well as 2,683 disease endpoints curated in the FinnGen Study (n = 218,792). Two PTVs were associated with both lipid levels and the risk of CAD or T2D: triglyceride-lowering variants in ANGPTL8 (-24.0[-30.4 to -16.9] mg/dL per rs760351239-T allele, P = 3.4 × 10-9) and ANGPTL4 (-14.4[-18.6 to -9.8] mg/dL per rs746226153-G allele, P = 4.3 × 10-9).

FinnGen cohort study. The authors collected information on up to 1,327 disease traits before and after CABG from nationwide healthcare registers. A mixed population and patient sample of 127,911 individuals including 3,784 CABG patients. The authors assessed the association between (1) traits and incident CABG and (2) CABG and incident traits using multivariate-adjusted Cox models. Patients who underwent CABG and were in the fourth quartile of a risk score based on the top predictors of mortality had 12.2-fold increased risk of dying (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.3-14.5) compared with those in the first quartile. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD risk factors were most strongly associated with incident CABG. However, CABG was associated with death due to cardiac causes (hazard ratio [HR], 3.7; 95% CI, 3.5-4.0) or other causes (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.4-2.7). CABG also was related to increased risk of several non-CVD traits, including anemia (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.8-4.1), gastrointestinal disorders (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.8-2.6), acute renal failure (HR, 4.2; 95% CI, 3.5-5.1), septicemia (HR, 3.6; 95% CI, 3.1-4.1), lung cancer (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9-2.8), Alzheimer's disease (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.2-2.7), and chronic obstuctive pulmonary disease (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.2-2.9).

Here, we leveraged summary statistics of a genome-wide association study including over one million parental lifespans to identify genetically regulated genes from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. Through a combination of multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association analyses and genetic colocalization, we identified novel genes that may be associated with parental lifespan. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses also identified circulating proteins and metabolites causally associated with parental lifespan and chronic diseases offering new drug repositioning opportunities such as those targeting apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins. Liver expression of HP, the gene encoding haptoglobin, and plasma haptoglobin levels were causally linked with parental lifespan. Phenome-wide MR analyses were used to map genetically regulated genes, proteins and metabolites with other human traits as well as the disease-related phenome in the FinnGen cohorts (n = 135,638). Altogether, this study identified new candidate genes, circulating proteins and metabolites that may influence human aging as well as potential therapeutic targets for chronic diseases that warrant further investigation.",Aging cell,2021,"Aged; Aging; Chronic Disease; Cohort Studies; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Longevity; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Middle Aged; Parents; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Proprotein Convertase 9; RNA-Seq; Transcriptome",False,0

Little is known about the causes of the condition, but diabetes is a strong risk factor. To begin to understand the biological mechanisms involved, we aimed to identify genetic variants associated with frozen shoulder and to use Mendelian randomization to test the causal role of diabetes. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of frozen shoulder in the UK Biobank using data from 10,104 cases identified from inpatient, surgical and primary care codes. We used data from FinnGen for replication and meta-analysis. We used one-sample and two-sample Mendelian randomization approaches to test for a causal association of diabetes with frozen shoulder. We identified five genome-wide significant loci. The most significant locus (lead SNP rs28971325; OR = 1.20, [95% CI: 1.16-1.24], p = 5x10-29) contained WNT7B. This variant was also associated with Dupuytren's disease (OR = 2.31 [2.24, 2.39], p<1x10-300) as were a further two of the frozen shoulder associated variants. The Mendelian randomization results provided evidence that type 1 diabetes is a causal risk factor for frozen shoulder (OR = 1.03 [1.02-1.05], p = 3x10-6). There was no evidence that obesity was causally associated with frozen shoulder, suggesting that diabetes influences risk of the condition through glycemic rather than mechanical effects. We have identified genetic loci associated with frozen shoulder. There is a large overlap with Dupuytren's disease associated loci. Diabetes is a likely causal risk factor.

Genetic information has been proposed to improve prediction beyond well-established clinical risk factors. While polygenic scores (PS) can capture an individual's genetic risk for ACS, its prediction performance may vary in the context of diverse correlated clinical conditions. Here, we aimed to test whether clinical conditions impact the association between PS and ACS. We explored the association between 405 clinical conditions diagnosed before baseline and 9080 incident cases of ACS in 387 832 individuals from the UK Biobank. Results were replicated in 6430 incident cases of ACS in 177 876 individuals from FinnGen. We identified 80 conventional (eg, stable angina pectoris and type 2 diabetes) and unconventional (eg, diaphragmatic hernia and inguinal hernia) associations with ACS. The association between PS and ACS was consistent in individuals with and without most clinical conditions. However, a diagnosis of stable angina pectoris yielded a differential association between PS and ACS. PS was associated with a significantly reduced (interaction  In summary, while most clinical conditions did not impact utility of PS for prediction of ACS, we found that PS was substantially less predictive of ACS in individuals with prevalent stable coronary heart disease.

Congenital forms can harm normal development if not detected and treated promptly. Clinical and biochemical diagnosis, especially of isolated CeH, can be challenging. Cases are not usually detected in neonatal screening, which, in most countries, is focused on detection of the more prevalent primary hypothyroidism. Until now, five genetic causes for isolated CeH have been identified. Here we aimed to identify the genetic cause in two brothers with impaired growth diagnosed with CeH at the age of 5 years.

Few studies have previously investigated genetic susceptibility and potential risk factors for LRTI. We used data from the UK Biobank, Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), and FinnGen to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Cases were subjects hospitalized with LRTI, and controls were subjects with no such hospitalization. We conducted stratification and interaction analyses to evaluate whether the genetic effect of LRTI differed by sex or smoking. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to identify the unconfounded relationship between cardiometabolic risk factors and LRTI. A total of 25 320 cases and 575 294 controls were included. The 15q25.1 locus reached genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis (rs10519203: OR 0.94, p 3.87e-11). The protective effect of effect allele of rs10519203 was present among smokers (OR 0.90, 95%CI 0.87-0.92, p 1.38e-15) but not among never-smokers (OR 1.01, 95%CI 0.97-1.06, p 5.20e-01).

FinnGen,33110245,An expanded analysis framework for multivariate GWAS connects inflammatory biomarkers to functional variants and disease.,"Multivariate methods are known to increase the statistical power to detect associations in the case of shared genetic basis between phenotypes. They have, however, lacked essential analytic tools to follow-up and understand the biology underlying these associations. We developed a novel computational workflow for multivariate GWAS follow-up analyses, including fine-mapping and identification of the subset of traits driving associations (driver traits). Many follow-up tools require univariate regression coefficients which are lacking from multivariate results. Our method overcomes this problem by using Canonical Correlation Analysis to turn each multivariate association into its optimal univariate Linear Combination Phenotype (LCP). This enables an LCP-GWAS, which in turn generates the statistics required for follow-up analyses. We implemented our method on 12 highly correlated inflammatory biomarkers in a Finnish population-based study. Altogether, we identified 11 associations, four of which (F5, ABO, C1orf140 and PDGFRB) were not detected by biomarker-specific analyses. Fine-mapping identified 19 signals within the 11 loci and driver trait analysis determined the traits contributing to the associations.

A two-sample two-step MR was used to determine 1) causal effects of SGLT2 inhibition on CAD and T2D; 2) causal effects of three choline metabolites, total choline, phosphatidylcholine, and glycine, on CAD and T2D; and 3) mediation effects of these metabolites. Genetic proxies for SGLT2 inhibition were identified as variants in the SLC5A2 gene that were associated with both levels of gene expression and hemoglobin A1c. Summary statistics for metabolites were from UK Biobank, CAD from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome wide Replication and Meta-analysis [CARDIoGRAM] plus The Coronary Artery Disease [C4D] Genetics) consortium, and T2D from DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) and the FinnGen study. SGLT2 inhibition (per 1 SD, 6.75 mmol/mol [1.09%] lowering of HbA1c) was associated with lower risk of T2D and CAD (odds ratio [OR] 0.25 [95% CI 0.12, 0.54], and 0.51 [0.28, 0.94], respectively) and positively with total choline (β 0.39 [95% CI 0.06, 0.72]), phosphatidylcholine (0.40 [0.13, 0.67]), and glycine (0.34 [0.05, 0.63]).

However, those associations could be vulnerable to residual confounding or reverse causality. Our aim was to estimate the association of insomnia with stillbirth, miscarriage, gestational diabetes (GD), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), perinatal depression, preterm birth (PTB), and low/high offspring birthweight (LBW/HBW). We used 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) with 81 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) instrumenting for a lifelong predisposition to insomnia. Our outcomes included ever experiencing stillbirth, ever experiencing miscarriage, GD, HDP, perinatal depression, PTB (gestational age <37 completed weeks), LBW (<2,500 grams), and HBW (>4,500 grams). We used data from women of European descent (N = 356,069, mean ages at delivery 25.5 to 30.0 years) from UK Biobank (UKB), FinnGen, Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), Born in Bradford (BiB), and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort (MoBa). Main MR analyses used inverse variance weighting (IVW), with weighted median and MR-Egger as sensitivity analyses. We compared MR estimates with multivariable regression of insomnia in pregnancy on outcomes in ALSPAC (N = 11,745). IVW showed evidence of an association of genetic susceptibility to insomnia with miscarriage (odds ratio (OR): 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18, 2.17, p = 0.002), perinatal depression (OR 3.56, 95% CI: 1.49, 8.54, p = 0.004), and LBW (OR 3.17, 95% CI: 1.69, 5.96, p < 0.001). IVW results did not support associations of insomnia with stillbirth, GD, HDP, PTB, and HBW, with wide CIs including the null. Associations of genetic susceptibility to insomnia with miscarriage, perinatal depression, and LBW were not observed in weighted median or MR-Egger analyses. Results from these sensitivity analyses were directionally consistent with IVW results for all outcomes, with the exception of GD, perinatal depression, and PTB in MR-Egger. Multivariable regression showed associations of insomnia at 18 weeks of gestation with perinatal depression (OR 2.96, 95% CI: 2.42, 3.63, p < 0.001), but not with LBW (OR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.69, 1.24, p = 0.60). Multivariable regression with miscarriage and stillbirth was not possible due to small numbers in index pregnancies. Key limitations are potential horizontal pleiotropy (particularly for perinatal depression) and low statistical power in MR, and residual confounding in multivariable regression. In this study, we observed some evidence in support of a possible causal relationship between genetically predicted insomnia and miscarriage, perinatal depression, and LBW. Our study also found observational evidence in support of an association between insomnia in pregnancy and perinatal depression, with no clear multivariable evidence of an association with LBW.

Meta-analysis of inverse variance weighted Mendelian randomization results from FinnGen and UK Biobank showed that genetically predicted 1-SD (4.2 years) higher education was associated with 44% (95% CI: 0.40-0.79) decreased hypertension risk and 1.682 mm Hg lower systolic and 0.898 mm Hg lower diastolic blood pressure, independently of intelligence and cognition. While the causal effects of intelligence and cognition on hypertension were not independent of education; 6 out of 25 cardiometabolic risk factors were identified as mediators of the association between education and hypertension, ranked by mediated proportions, including body mass index (mediated proportion: 30.1%), waist-to-hip ratio (22.8%), body fat percentage (14.1%), major depression (7.0%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (4.7%), and triglycerides (3.4%).

FinnGen,35952493,Genetic insights into therapeutic targets for aortic aneurysms: A Mendelian randomization study.,"As aortic aneurysms (AAs) enlarge, they can become life-threatening if left undiagnosed or neglected. At present, there is a lack of radical treatments for preventing disease progression. Therefore, we aimed to identify effective drug targets that slow the progression of AAs. A Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to identify therapeutic targets which are associated with AAs. Summary statistics for AAs were obtained from two datasets: the UK Biobank (2228 cases and 408,565 controls) and the FinnGen study (3658 cases and 244,907 controls). Cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) for druggable genes were retrieved from the eQTLGen Consortium and used as genetic instrumental variables. Colocalization analysis was performed to determine the probability that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AAs and eQTL shared causal genetic variants. Four drug targets (BTN3A1, FASN, PLAU, and PSMA4) showed significant MR results in two independent datasets. Proteasome 20S subunit alpha 4 (PSMA4) and plasminogen activator, urokinase (PLAU) in particular, were found to have strong evidence for colocalization with AAs, and abdominal aortic aneurysm in particular. Additionally, except for the association between PSMA4 and intracranial aneurysms, no association between genetically proxied inhibition of PLAU and PSMA4 was detected in increasing the risk of other cardiometabolic risks and diseases. This study supports that drug-targeting PLAU and PSMA4 inhibition may reduce the risk of AAs.

FinnGen,34739073,Depression and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Bidirectional Two-sample Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Observational studies have suggested a bidirectional association between depression and inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], including Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]. However, it remains unclear whether the observed associations are causal due to the difficulties of determining sequential temporality. We investigated the association between depression and IBD by using bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization [MR]. Independent genetic variants for depression and IBD were selected as instruments from published genome-wide association studies [GWAS] among individuals of predominantly European ancestry. Summary statistics for instrument-outcome associations were retrieved from three separate databases for both depression [Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, FinnGen and UK Biobank] and IBD [the largest GWAS meta-analysis, FinnGen and UK Biobank], respectively. MR analyses included the inverse-variance-weighted method, weighted-median estimator, MR-Egger regression, and sensitivity analyses of Steiger filtering and MR PRESSO. From either direction, analyses were performed per outcome database and were subsequently meta-analysed using a fixed-effect model. Genetically predicted depression [per log-odds ratio increase] was associated with a higher risk of IBD; odds ratios [95% confidence interval] for IBD, CD and UC were 1.20 [1.05, 1.36], 1.29 [1.07, 1.56] and 1.22 [1.01, 1.47] in a combined sample size of 693 183 [36 507 IBD cases], 212 172 [13 714 CD cases] and 219 686 [15 691 UC cases] individuals, respectively. In contrast, no association was observed between genetically influenced IBD and depression in 534 635 individuals [71 466 depression cases]. Our findings corroborated a causal association of depression on IBD, which may impact the clinical decision on the management of depression in patients with IBD. Though our results did not support a causal effect of IBD on depression, further investigations are needed to clarify the effect of IBD activity on depression [with different symptomology].",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,2022,"Chronic Disease; Colitis, Ulcerative; Depression; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,5

However, a direct causally relation between IMIDs and VTE remains unclear to date. Here, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate causal associations between IMIDs and VTE. We collected genetic data from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for six common IMIDs, specifically inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis (PSO), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); and summary-level data for VTE, pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from the FinnGen database. Two-sample MR analysis using inverse variance weighting (IVW) was performed to identify causal associations between IMIDs and VTE/DVT/PE, and sensitivity analyses were implemented for robustness. IVW analysis showed a causal relationship between genetically predicted UC (one type of IBD) and the risk of VTE (OR = 1.043, 95% CI: 1.013-1.073, p = 0.004) and DVT (OR = 1.088, 95% CI: 1.043-1.136, p < 0.001), but we found no evidence of causality between UC and PE (OR = 1.029, 95% CI: 0.986-1.074, p = 0.19). In addition, no associations were observed between total IBD, CD, RA, SLE, or PSO and VTE/DVT/PE. Sensitivity analysis found no evidence for horizontal pleiotropy.

We conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study to determine the association between S-25(OH)D and NAFLD. Seven and 6 independent genetic variants associated with S-25(OH)D and NAFLD at the genome-wide-significance level, respectively, were selected as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for S-25(OH)D were obtained from the Study of Underlying Genetic Determinants of Vitamin D and Highly Related Traits consortium including 79,366 individuals. Summary-level data for NAFLD were available from a genome-wide association meta-analysis (1483 cases and 17,781 controls), the FinnGen consortium (894 cases and 217,898 controls), and the UK Biobank study (275 cases and 360,919 controls). Summary-level data for 4 liver enzymes were obtained from the UK Biobank. There were genetic correlations of S-25(OH)D with NAFLD and certain liver enzymes. Genetically predicted higher levels of S-25(OH)D were consistently associated with a decreased risk of NAFLD in the 3 sources. For a 1-SD increase in genetically predicted S-25(OH)D levels, the combined odds ratio of NAFLD was 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.89). Genetically predicted higher levels of S-25(OH)D showed a borderline association with aspartate aminotransferase levels (change -1.17; 95% CI, -1.36 to 0.01). Genetic predisposition to NAFLD was not associated with S-25(OH)D (change 0.13; 95% CI, -1.26 to 0.53).

The aim of this study was to utilize Mendelian randomization to decipher the potential causal associations of vitamin C with risk of digestive system cancers. Ten genetic variants previously found to be significantly associated with circulating vitamin C were used as instrumental variables. Effect size estimates for the genetic associations of the vitamin C-associated genetic variants with six major malignancies of digestive system were obtained from the FinnGen (N = 309 154) and UK Biobank (N = 367 542) studies. Results from the two studies were combined using meta-analysis. Genetically predicted higher circulating vitamin C showed a suggestive association with lower risk of small intestine and colorectal cancer after accounting for multiple testing.

Still, the evidence about the causal role of metabolites in facilitating or preventing epilepsy is lacking. Systematically investigating the causality between blood metabolites and epilepsy would help provide novel targets for epilepsy screening and prevention.

FinnGen,35113855,Genetically proxied therapeutic inhibition of antihypertensive drug targets and risk of common cancers: A mendelian randomization analysis.,"Epidemiological studies have reported conflicting findings on the potential adverse effects of long-term antihypertensive medication use on cancer risk. Naturally occurring variation in genes encoding antihypertensive drug targets can be used as proxies for these targets to examine the effect of their long-term therapeutic inhibition on disease outcomes. We performed a mendelian randomization analysis to examine the association between genetically proxied inhibition of 3 antihypertensive drug targets and risk of 4 common cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACE, ADRB1, and SLC12A3 associated (P < 5.0 × 10-8) with systolic blood pressure (SBP) in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used to proxy inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), β-1 adrenergic receptor (ADRB1), and sodium-chloride symporter (NCC), respectively. Summary genetic association estimates for these SNPs were obtained from GWAS consortia for the following cancers: breast (122,977 cases, 105,974 controls), colorectal (58,221 cases, 67,694 controls), lung (29,266 cases, 56,450 controls), and prostate (79,148 cases, 61,106 controls). Replication analyses were performed in the FinnGen consortium (1,573 colorectal cancer cases, 120,006 controls). Cancer GWAS and FinnGen consortia data were restricted to individuals of European ancestry. Inverse-variance weighted random-effects models were used to examine associations between genetically proxied inhibition of these drug targets and risk of cancer. Multivariable mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses were employed to examine robustness of findings to violations of mendelian randomization assumptions. Genetically proxied ACE inhibition equivalent to a 1-mm Hg reduction in SBP was associated with increased odds of colorectal cancer (odds ratio (OR) 1.13, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.22; P = 3.6 × 10-4). This finding was replicated in the FinnGen consortium (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.92; P = 0.035). There was little evidence of association of genetically proxied ACE inhibition with risk of breast cancer (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.02, P = 0.35), lung cancer (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.10; P = 0.93), or prostate cancer (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.13; P = 0.08). Genetically proxied inhibition of ADRB1 and NCC were not associated with risk of these cancers. The primary limitations of this analysis include the modest statistical power for analyses of drug targets in relation to some less common histological subtypes of cancers examined and the restriction of the majority of analyses to participants of European ancestry. In this study, we observed that genetically proxied long-term ACE inhibition was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, warranting comprehensive evaluation of the safety profiles of ACE inhibitors in clinical trials with adequate follow-up.

Nevertheless, the probable mechanism of dyslipidemia's effect on NAFLD remains unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) was utilized to investigate the relationship between lipids, inflammatory factors, and NAFLD; and also, to determine the proportion mediated by interleukin-17(IL-17) and interleukin-1β(IL-1β) for the effect between lipids and NAFLD. Summary statistics of traits were obtained from the latest and largest genome-wide association study (GWAS).

FinnGen,36473423,Milk consumption and risk of twelve cancers: A large-scale observational and Mendelian randomisation study.,"Milk consumption is a modifiable lifestyle factor that has been associated with several cancer types in observational studies. Limited evidence exists regarding the causality of these relationships. Using a genetic variant (rs4988235) near the lactase gene (LCT) locus that proxies milk consumption, we conducted a comprehensive survey to assess potential causal relationships between milk consumption and 12 types of cancer. Our analyses were conducted using white British participants of the UK Biobank (n = up to 255,196), the FinnGen cohort (up to 260,405), and available cancer consortia. We included cancers with previous evidence of an association with milk consumption in observational studies, as well as cancers common in both UK Biobank and FinnGen populations (>1000 cases). We evaluated phenotypic associations of milk intake and cancer incidence in the UK Biobank, and then used a Mendelian randomisation (MR) approach to assess causality in the UK Biobank, FinnGen consortium, and combined analyses incorporating additional consortia data for five cancers. In MR meta-analyses, case numbers for cancers of breast, ovary, uterus, cervix, prostate, bladder and urinary tract, colorectum, and lung ranged between 6000 and 148,000 cases, and between 780 and 1342 cases for cancers of the liver, mouth, stomach and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In observational analyses, milk consumption was associated with higher risk of bladder and urinary tract cancer (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.47), but not with any other cancer. This association was not confirmed in the MR analysis, and genetically predicted milk consumption showed a significant association only with lower risk of colorectal cancer (0.89, 0.81-0.98 per additional 50 g/day). In the MR analyses conducted among individual cohorts, genetically predicted milk consumption provided evidence for an association with lower colorectal cancer in the FinnGen cohort (0.85, 0.74-0.97), and in the UK Biobank greater risk of female breast cancer (1.12, 1.03-1.23), and uterine cancer in pre-menopausal females (3.98, 1.48-10.7). In a comprehensive survey of milk-cancer associations, we confirm of a protective role of milk consumption for colorectal cancer. Our analyses also provide some suggestion for higher risks of breast cancer and premenopausal uterine cancer, warranting further investigation.","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2023,"Male; Female; Humans; Animals; Milk; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Colorectal Neoplasms; Breast Neoplasms; Uterine Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,9

Here, we performed a genome-wide association study of 102,084 migraine cases and 771,257 controls and identified 123 loci, of which 86 are previously unknown. These loci provide an opportunity to evaluate shared and distinct genetic components in the two main migraine subtypes: migraine with aura and migraine without aura. Stratification of the risk loci using 29,679 cases with subtype information indicated three risk variants that seem specific for migraine with aura (in HMOX2, CACNA1A and MPPED2), two that seem specific for migraine without aura (near SPINK2 and near FECH) and nine that increase susceptibility for migraine regardless of subtype. The new risk loci include genes encoding recent migraine-specific drug targets, namely calcitonin gene-related peptide (CALCA/CALCB) and serotonin 1F receptor (HTR1F). Overall, genomic annotations among migraine-associated variants were enriched in both vascular and central nervous system tissue/cell types, supporting unequivocally that neurovascular mechanisms underlie migraine pathophysiology.",Nature genetics,2022,"Alleles; Cardiovascular System; Case-Control Studies; Central Nervous System; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Migraine with Aura; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci",False,8

Independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the potential risk factors at P < 5 × 10-8 in large-scale genome-wide association studies were selected as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for the associations of the selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms with migraine were obtained from the FinnGen consortium comprising 6687 cases and 144,780 noncases and the UK Biobank study comprising 1072 cases and 360,122 noncases. Estimates derived from the FinnGen and UK Biobank cohorts were combined using fixed-effects meta-analysis. We found evidence for associations of genetically predicted alcohol consumption (odds ratio [OR] 0.54 per SD increase in log-transformed alcoholic drinks per week, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.82; P = 0.004), coffee consumption (OR 0.56 per 50% increase in coffee consumption, 95% CI, 0.45-0.70; P < 0.001), and smoking initiation (OR 1.15 for one SD increase in the prevalence of smoking initiation, 95% CI, 1.01-1.31; P = 0.038). These associations persisted in sensitivity analyses, including mutual adjustment in multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses. In reverse Mendelian randomization analyses, genetic liability to migraine was inversely associated with alcohol consumption but was not associated with coffee consumption or smoking initiation. This study provides genetic evidence in support of a protective role of moderate coffee consumption and a detrimental role of cigarette smoking in the etiology of migraine.

The GWAS results for lifetime smoking (N = 462 690) were obtained from the UK Biobank samples. Summary statistics for psoriasis were obtained from a recent GWAS meta-analysis of eight cohorts comprising 19 032 cases and 286 769 controls and the FinnGen consortium, comprising 4510 cases and 212 242 controls. Linkage disequilibrium score regression was applied to compute the genetic correlation. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to determine casual direction using independent genetic variants that reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10 There were genetic correlations between smoking and psoriasis.

We conducted phenome-wide Mendelian randomization and disease-trajectory analyses to assess any associations of circulating Lp(a) levels with a broad range of diseases. A weighted polygenic risk score was constructed using independent genetic variants in the LPA gene and with an established effect on Lp(a) levels. The PheWAS analysis included 1081 phenotype outcomes ascertained among 385,917 White participants of the UK Biobank. Novel findings were investigated in MR analysis using data from the FinnGen consortium. Disease-trajectory and comorbidity analyses were further conducted to explore the sequential patterns of multiple morbidities related to high circulating Lp(a) levels. PheWAS revealed statistically significant associations of higher circulating Lp(a) levels with increased risk of a large number of circulatory system diseases (including various cardiac diseases, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and valvular and cerebrovascular diseases) as well as some endocrine/metabolic diseases (including hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, disorders of lipoid metabolism, and type 2 diabetes), genitourinary system diseases (renal failure), and hematologic diseases (including different types of anemia). Two-sample MR analysis supported the association between Lp(a) and risk of anemia, showed a suggestive association with type 2 diabetes, but found no association with renal failure. Disease-trajectory and comorbidity analyses identified 3 major sequential patterns of multiple morbidities, mainly in the cardiovascular, metabolic, and mental disorders, related to high circulating Lp(a) levels.

Biobank-based recontacting pilot study. Three Finnish biobanks (Helsinki, Auria, Tampere) recruiting participants from February 2021 to July 2021. All eligible invitees were enrolled in FinnGen by their biobanks (Helsinki, Auria, Tampere), had available genetic data and were >18 years old. Individuals with severe neuropsychiatric disease or cognitive or physical disabilities were excluded. Lastly, 5995 participants were selected based on their polygenic score for cognitive abilities and invited to the study. Among invitees, 1115 had successfully participated and completed the study questionnaire(s). The primary outcome was the participation rate among study invitees. Secondary outcomes included questionnaire completion rate, quality of data collected and comparison of participation rate boosting strategies. The overall participation rate was 18.6% among all invitees and 23.1% among individuals aged 18-69. A second reminder letter yielded an additional 9.7% participation rate in those who did not respond to the first invitation. Recontacting participants via an online healthcare portal yielded lower participation than recontacting via physical letter. The completion rate of the questionnaire and cognitive tests was high (92% and 85%, respectively), and measurements were overall reliable among participants. For example, the correlation (r) between self-reported body mass index and that collected by the biobanks was 0.92. In summary, this pilot suggests that recontacting FinnGen participants with the goal to collect a wide range of cognitive, behavioural and lifestyle information without additional engagement results in a low participation rate, but with reliable data.

We conducted Cox regression analysis on 358 451 participants free of hypertension or stroke from UK Biobank. To validate the results of the observational analysis, we conducted a 2-sample MR for daytime napping frequency (123 single-nucleotide polymorphisms) with essential hypertension in FinnGen Biobank, stroke, and ischemic stroke in MEGASTROKE consortium and performed a corresponding 1-sample MR on the UK Biobank data. Compared with never napping, usually napping was associated with a higher risk of essential hypertension (hazard ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.08-1.17]), stroke (hazard ratio, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.10-1.39], and ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.05-1.36]) in our prospective observational analysis. Both the 1-sample and 2-sample MR results indicated that increased daytime napping frequency was likely to be a potential causal risk factor for essential hypertension in FinnGEN (odds ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.06-1.92]) and UK Biobank (odds ratio, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.28-1.58]). The 2-sample MR results supported the potential causal effect of nap frequency on ischemic stroke in MEGASTROKE (odds ratio, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.04-1.62]). Prospective observational and MR analyses provided evidence that increased daytime nap frequency may represent a potential causal risk factor for essential hypertension.

FinnGen,36089592,Investigating causal relations between sleep duration and risks of adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes: linear and nonlinear Mendelian randomization analyses.,"Observational studies have reported maternal short/long sleep duration to be associated with adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. However, it remains unclear whether there are nonlinear causal effects. Our aim was to use Mendelian randomization (MR) and multivariable regression to examine nonlinear effects of sleep duration on stillbirth (MR only), miscarriage (MR only), gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, perinatal depression, preterm birth and low/high offspring birthweight. We used data from European women in UK Biobank (N=176,897), FinnGen (N=~123,579), Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N=6826), Born in Bradford (N=2940) and Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa, N=14,584). We used 78 previously identified genetic variants as instruments for sleep duration and investigated its effects using two-sample, and one-sample nonlinear (UK Biobank only), MR. We compared MR findings with multivariable regression in MoBa (N=76,669), where maternal sleep duration was measured at 30 weeks. In UK Biobank, MR provided evidence of nonlinear effects of sleep duration on stillbirth, perinatal depression and low offspring birthweight. Shorter and longer duration increased stillbirth and low offspring birthweight; shorter duration increased perinatal depression. For example, longer sleep duration was related to lower risk of low offspring birthweight (odds ratio 0.79 per 1 h/day (95% confidence interval: 0.67, 0.93)) in the shortest duration group and higher risk (odds ratio 1.40 (95% confidence interval: 1.06, 1.84)) in the longest duration group, suggesting shorter and longer duration increased the risk. These were supported by the lack of evidence of a linear effect of sleep duration on any outcome using two-sample MR. In multivariable regression, risks of all outcomes were higher in the women reporting <5 and ≥10 h/day sleep compared with the reference category of 8-9 h/day, despite some wide confidence intervals. Nonlinear models fitted the data better than linear models for most outcomes (likelihood ratio P-value=0.02 to 3.2×10 Our results show shorter and longer sleep duration potentially causing higher risks of stillbirth, perinatal depression and low offspring birthweight.

FinnGen,36580444,Associations of genetically predicted fatty acid levels across the phenome: A mendelian randomisation study.,"Fatty acids are important dietary factors that have been extensively studied for their implication in health and disease. Evidence from epidemiological studies and randomised controlled trials on their role in cardiovascular, inflammatory, and other diseases remains inconsistent. The objective of this study was to assess whether genetically predicted fatty acid concentrations affect the risk of disease across a wide variety of clinical health outcomes. The UK Biobank (UKB) is a large study involving over 500,000 participants aged 40 to 69 years at recruitment from 2006 to 2010. We used summary-level data for 117,143 UKB samples (base dataset), to extract genetic associations of fatty acids, and individual-level data for 322,232 UKB participants (target dataset) to conduct our discovery analysis. We studied potentially causal relationships of circulating fatty acids with 845 clinical diagnoses, using mendelian randomisation (MR) approach, within a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) framework. Regression models in PheWAS were adjusted for sex, age, and the first 10 genetic principal components. External summary statistics were used for replication. When several fatty acids were associated with a health outcome, multivariable MR and MR-Bayesian method averaging (MR-BMA) was applied to disentangle their causal role. Genetic predisposition to higher docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was associated with cholelithiasis and cholecystitis (odds ratio per mmol/L: 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.66 to 0.87). This was supported in replication analysis (FinnGen study) and by the genetically predicted omega-3 fatty acids analyses. Genetically predicted linoleic acid (LA), omega-6, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and total fatty acids (total FAs) showed positive associations with cardiovascular outcomes with support from replication analysis. Finally, higher genetically predicted levels of DHA (0.83, 0.73 to 0.95) and omega-3 (0.83, 0.75 to 0.92) were found to have a protective effect on obesity, which was supported using body mass index (BMI) in the GIANT consortium as replication analysis. Multivariable MR analysis suggested a direct detrimental effect of LA (1.64, 1.07 to 2.50) and omega-6 fatty acids (1.81, 1.06 to 3.09) on coronary heart disease (CHD). MR-BMA prioritised LA and omega-6 fatty acids as the top risk factors for CHD. Although we present a range of sensitivity analyses to the address MR assumptions, horizontal pleiotropy may still bias the reported associations and further evaluation in clinical trials is needed. Our study suggests potentially protective effects of circulating DHA and omega-3 concentrations on cholelithiasis and cholecystitis and on obesity, highlighting the need to further assess them as prevention treatments in clinical trials.

Independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms strongly associated with RA (n = 70) were selected as instrumental variables from a genome-wide association meta-analysis including 14,361 RA patients and 43,923 controls of European ancestry. Summary-level data for CAD, all stroke, any ischemic stroke and its subtypes, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage were obtained from meta-analyses of genetic studies, international genetic consortia, the UK Biobank, and the FinnGen consortium. We obtained summary-level data for common cardiovascular risk factors and related inflammatory biomarkers to assess possible mechanisms. Genetic liability to RA was associated with an increased risk of CAD and ICH. For a 1-unit increase in log odds of RA, the combined odds ratios were 1.02 (95% confidence interval [1.01, 1.03]; P = 0.003) for CAD and 1.05 (95% confidence interval [1.02, 1.08]; P = 0.001) for ICH. Genetic liability to RA was associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor and C-reactive protein (CRP). The association with CAD was attenuated after adjustment for genetically predicted CRP levels. There were no associations of genetic liability to RA with the other studied outcomes. This study found that genetic liability to RA was associated with an increased risk of CAD and ICH and that the association with CAD might be mediated by CRP. The heightened cardiovascular risk should be actively monitored and managed in RA patients, and this may include dampening systemic inflammation.","Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",2022,"Humans; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Biomarkers; C-Reactive Protein; Coronary Artery Disease; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Stroke; Tumor Necrosis Factors",False,2

The reverse MR analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of HF on serum urate levels. Genetically determined serum urate level was associated with HF [odds ratio (OR), 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.10; P = 8.6×10-5]. The main results kept robust in the most sensitivity analyses. The association pattern remained for the HF in FinnGen (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.19; P = 0.008) and the combined results of three data sources (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.13; P < 0.001). No consistent evidence was found for the causal effect of HF on serum urate levels. We provide consistent evidence for the causal effect of genetically predicted serum urate level on HF, but not the reverse effect of HF.

FinnGen,35066242,Interleukins and rheumatoid arthritis: bi-directional Mendelian randomization investigation.,"To assess the causality of the associations between interleukins (ILs) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using Mendelian randomization (MR) design. Genetic instruments and summary-level data for ten ILs were obtained from three genome-wide association meta-analyses. Corresponding data on RA were obtained from a meta-analysis of 22 genome-wide association studies (14,361 cases and 43,923 controls) and the FinnGen consortium (6236 cases, 4596 seropositive cases, 1937 seronegative cases, and 172,834 controls). Forward and reverse MR analyses were performed. The odds ratios (ORs) of RA were 2.08 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.56-2.77; p<0.001), 2.14 (95% CI, 1.85-2.49; p<0.001), and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92-0.97; p<0.001) for one standard deviation increase in genetically predicted IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-6 receptor antagonist (IL-6ra) levels, respectively. There were suggestive associations of genetically predicted IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) (OR, 0.85, 95% CI, 0.76, 0.96; p=0.010) and IL-18 (OR, 1.07, 95% CI, 1.00, 1.15; p=0.043) levels with RA risk. Subtype-specific associations were observed for seropositive RA (IL-1β, IL-1ra, and IL-6) and seronegative RA (IL-2 receptor alpha subunit, IL-8, and IL-18). Reverse MR analysis found a suggestive association between genetic liability to RA and IL-6 receptor antagonist (change 0.015; 95% CI, 0.003-0.028; p=0.015). This MR study suggests that long-term IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition may reduce the risk of RA, particularly seropositive RA. Upregulations of ILs involved in IL-6 signaling pathways appears to be downstream effects of RA, which supports the blocking IL-6 treatment for RA.",Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,2022,"Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Interleukins; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,2

Here we performed a mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate whether this association is causal. Forty-four independent genetic variants strongly associated with tea intake were identified from a large genome-wide association study, including 448 060 individuals of the UK Biobank. We additionally obtained genome-wide association study summary statistics for kidney stones from the FinnGen consortium (5985 cases and 253 943 controls) and UK Biobank (6536 cases and 388 508 controls). Random-effect inverse variance weighted regression was used to evaluate causal estimates. The random-effect inverse variance weighted estimates based on the FinnGen consortium and UK Biobank were meta-analyzed using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Other MR methods, including MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier, were also performed to test the robustness of our results. In a combined sample of 12 521 cases and 642 451 controls, the inverse variance weighted analysis indicated that genetically predicted tea intake was causally associated with a decreased risk of kidney stones (odds ratio = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.34-0.66; P < 0.001). This association was consistent in other MR methods. This study suggests that tea intake may be causally associated with a decreased risk of kidney stones.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2023,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Kidney Calculi; Tea",False,2
FinnGen,36156818,Childhood asthma and type 1 diabetes mellitus: A meta-analysis and bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"Worldwide incidence and prevalence of both asthma and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in children have been increasing in past decades. Association between the two diseases has been found in some but not in other studies. We conducted a meta-analysis to verify such an association, and bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis to examine the potential cause-effect relationships. Three databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) were searched from their inception to February 1, 2021. Pooled hazard ratios (HR) or odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals, were calculated. Associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms with childhood asthma and T1DM were selected based on genome-wide association studies. The outcome datasets were obtained from FinnGen study. We used the inverse-variance-weighted (IVW), weighted median and MR-Egger methods to estimate causal effects. To assess robustness and horizontal pleiotropy, MR-Egger regression and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier test were conducted. In meta-analysis, childhood asthma was associated with an increased risk of T1DM (HR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61, P = .014), whereas T1DM was not associated with the risk of asthma (HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.64-1.51, P = .941; OR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.65-1.08, P = .168). MR analysis indicated increased genetic risk of T1DM in children with asthma (OR = 1.308; 95% CI 1.030-1.661; P = .028). Analysis using the IVW method indicated no association between T1DM and genetic risk of asthma (OR = 1.027, 95%CI 0.970-1.089, P = .358). Both meta-analysis and MR study suggested that childhood asthma was a risk factor for T1DM. No epidemiological or genetic evidence was found for an association of T1DM with asthma incidence.

FinnGen,35717579,Rare germline deleterious variants increase susceptibility for lung cancer.,"Although multiple common susceptibility loci for lung cancer (LC) have been identified by genome-wide association studies, they can explain only a small portion of heritability. The etiological contribution of rare deleterious variants (RDVs) to LC risk is not fully characterized and may account for part of the missing heritability. Here, we sequenced the whole exomes of 2777 participants from the Environment and Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology study, a homogenous population including 1461 LC cases and 1316 controls. In single-variant analyses, we identified a new RDV, rs77187983 [EHBP1, odds ratio (OR) = 3.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.34-7.30, P = 0.008] and replicated two previously reported RDVs, rs11571833 (BRCA2, OR = 2.18; 95% CI = 1.25-3.81, P = 0.006) and rs752672077 (MPZL2, OR = 3.70, 95% CI = 1.04-13.15, P = 0.044). In gene-based analyses, we confirmed BRCA2 (P = 0.007) and ATM (P = 0.014) associations with LC risk and identified TRIB3 (P = 0.009), involved in maintaining genome stability and DNA repair, as a new candidate susceptibility gene. Furthermore, cases were enriched with RDVs in homologous recombination repair [carrier frequency (CF) = 22.9% versus 19.5%, P = 0.017] and Fanconi anemia (CF = 12.5% versus 10.2%, P = 0.036) pathways. Our results were not significant after multiple testing corrections but were enriched in cases versus controls from large scale public biobank resources, including The Cancer Genome Atlas, FinnGen and UK Biobank. Our study identifies novel candidate genes and highlights the importance of RDVs in DNA repair-related genes for LC susceptibility.

FinnGen,34651315,Genome-wide analysis identifies gallstone-susceptibility loci including genes regulating gastrointestinal motility.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several risk loci for gallstone disease. As with most polygenic traits, it is likely that many genetic determinants are undiscovered. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants that represent new targets for gallstone research and treatment. We performed a GWAS of 28,627 gallstone cases and 348,373 controls in the UK Biobank, replicated findings in a Scottish cohort (1089 cases, 5228 controls), and conducted a GWA meta-analysis (43,639 cases, 506,798 controls) with the FinnGen cohort. We assessed pathway enrichment using gene-based then gene-set analysis and tissue expression of identified genes in Genotype-Tissue Expression project data. We constructed a polygenic risk score (PRS) and evaluated phenotypic traits associated with the score. Seventy-five risk loci were identified (p < 5 × 10 This GWAS demonstrates the polygenic nature of gallstone risk and identifies 46 novel susceptibility loci.

FinnGen,34559723,Polygenic Score for Physical Activity Is Associated with Multiple Common Diseases.,"Genetic pleiotropy, in which the same genes affect two or more traits, may partially explain the frequently observed associations between high physical activity (PA) and later reduced morbidity or mortality. This study investigated associations between PA polygenic risk scores (PRS) and cardiometabolic diseases among the Finnish population. PRS for device-measured overall PA were adapted to a FinnGen study cohort of 218,792 individuals with genomewide genotyping and extensive digital longitudinal health register data. Associations between PA PRS and body mass index, diseases, and mortality were analyzed with linear and logistic regression models. A high PA PRS predicted a lower body mass index (β = -0.025 kg·m-2 per one SD change in PA PRS, SE = 0.013, P = 1.87 × 10-80). The PA PRS also predicted a lower risk for diseases that typically develop later in life or not at all among highly active individuals. A lower disease risk was systematically observed for cardiovascular diseases (odds ratio [OR] per 1 SD change in PA PRS = 0.95, P = 9.5 × 10-19) and, for example, hypertension [OR = 0.93, P = 2.7 × 10-44), type 2 diabetes (OR = 0.91, P = 4.1 × 10-42), and coronary heart disease (OR = 0.95, P = 1.2 × 10-9). Participants with high PA PRS had also lower mortality risk (OR = 0.97, P = 0.0003). Genetically less active persons are at a higher risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases, which may partly explain the previously observed associations between low PA and higher disease and mortality risk. The same inherited physical fitness and metabolism-related mechanisms may be associated both with PA levels and with cardiometabolic disease risk.",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2022,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiometabolic Risk Factors; Cardiovascular Diseases; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Decision Rules; Exercise; Female; Finland; Genetic Markers; Genetic Pleiotropy; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Infant; Linear Models; Logistic Models; Male; Metabolic Diseases; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; Young Adult",False,0
FinnGen,36521586,Mendelian randomization investigation highlights different roles of selenium status in mental disorders.,"Observational studies have suggested a relationship between selenium status and mental disorders (MDs). However, it remains unclear whether selenium status was causally associated with MDs. Thus, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics to investigate the causal effects of selenium levels on seven MDs, including schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD), anorexia nervosa (AN), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and panic disorder (PD). Strong genetic instruments of blood selenium (n = 9) and blood-toenail selenium (n = 12) were applied to the above seven MDs GWAS datasets from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, which were further replicated in the FinnGen Biobank. The inverse-variance weighted method was employed to calculate the causal effects. The results showed that genetically predicted blood selenium levels were associated with a decreased risk of schizophrenia (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.87-0.95) and AN (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77-0.97). However, both blood and blood-toenail selenium levels were linked to an increased risk of MDD (blood: OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.05-1.12; blood-toenail: OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04-1.13) and ASD (blood: OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.05-1.17; blood-toenail: OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.21), respectively. No obvious associations were found between selenium levels and BD as well as ADHD. Our findings highlighted a protective role of selenium in SZ and AN, while a risk effect in MDD and ASD.

FinnGen,35984822,Genetically predicted cortisol levels and risk of venous thromboembolism.,"In observational studies, venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been associated with Cushing's syndrome and with persistent mental stress, two conditions associated with higher cortisol levels. However, it remains unknown whether high cortisol levels within the usual range are causally associated with VTE risk. We aimed to assess the association between plasma cortisol levels and VTE risk using Mendelian randomization. Three genetic variants in the SERPINA1/SERPINA6 locus (rs12589136, rs11621961 and rs2749527) were used to proxy plasma cortisol. The associations of the cortisol-associated genetic variants with VTE were acquired from the INVENT (28 907 cases and 157 243 non-cases) and FinnGen (6913 cases and 169 986 non-cases) consortia. Corresponding data for VTE subtypes were available from the FinnGen consortium and UK Biobank. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses (inverse-variance weighted method) were performed. Genetic predisposition to higher plasma cortisol levels was associated with a reduced risk of VTE (odds ratio [OR] per one standard deviation increment 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-0.87, p<0.001). The association was stronger for deep vein thrombosis (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.88, p = 0.003) than for pulmonary embolism which did not achieve statistical significance (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63-1.09, p = 0.184). Adjusting for genetically predicted systolic blood pressure inverted the direction of the point estimate for VTE, although the resulting CI was wide (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.70-1.61, p = 0.780). This study provides evidence that genetically predicted plasma cortisol levels in the high end of the normal range are associated with a decreased risk of VTE and that this association may be mediated by blood pressure. This study has implications for the planning of observational studies of cortisol and VTE, suggesting that blood pressure traits should be measured and accounted for.",PloS one,2022,Humans; Hydrocortisone; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Pulmonary Embolism; Risk Factors; Venous Thromboembolism,False,8
FinnGen,36450729,Whole-exome sequencing study identifies rare variants and genes associated with intraocular pressure and glaucoma.,"Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. IOP is also the only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma. Previous genome-wide association studies have established the contribution of common genetic variants to IOP. The role of rare variants for IOP was unknown. Using whole exome sequencing data from 110,260 participants in the UK Biobank (UKB), we conducted the largest exome-wide association study of IOP to date. In addition to confirming known IOP genes, we identified 40 novel rare-variant genes for IOP, such as BOD1L1, ACAD10 and HLA-B, demonstrating the power of including and aggregating rare variants in gene discovery. About half of these IOP genes are also associated with glaucoma phenotypes in UKB and the FinnGen cohort. Six of these genes, i.e. ADRB1, PTPRB, RPL26, RPL10A, EGLN2, and MTOR, are drug targets that are either established for clinical treatment or in clinical trials. Furthermore, we constructed a rare-variant polygenic risk score and showed its significant association with glaucoma in independent participants (n = 312,825).

We aimed to examine the association between fetuin-A levels in early pregnancy and risk of incident GDM and to evaluate whether this association was causal. A total of 332 pregnant women with GDM and 664 matched controls were included in this nested case-control study. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was applied to investigate the prospective association between serum fetuin-A in early pregnancy and subsequent risk of GDM. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to examine the causal association, using summary statistics from the CHARGE Consortium and the FinnGen consortium. The mean age of the participants was 28.0 years, and the mean gestational age was 11.0 weeks (range 6-15) at enrollment. In the final model, the odds ratio (OR) for GDM comparing the extreme quartiles of fetuin-A levels was 1.78 (95% CI 1.06, 2.98; P for trend = 0.009), and the restricted cubic spline analysis indicated a linear association (P for nonlinearity = 0.83). This positive association was found in women with waist circumference <80 cm but not in those with waist circumference ≥80 cm (P for interaction = 0.04). However, MR analyses showed no evidence of a causal association with an OR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.67, 1.23) per unit increment of fetuin-A.

FinnGen,36285626,The Finnish genetic heritage in 2022 - from diagnosis to translational research.,"Isolated populations have been valuable for the discovery of rare monogenic diseases and their causative genetic variants. Finnish disease heritage (FDH) is an example of a group of hereditary monogenic disorders caused by single major, usually autosomal-recessive, variants enriched in the population due to several past genetic drift events. Interestingly, distinct subpopulations have remained in Finland and have maintained their unique genetic repertoire. Thus, FDH diseases have persisted, facilitating vigorous research on the underlying molecular mechanisms and development of treatment options. This Review summarizes the current status of FDH, including the most recently discovered FDH disorders, and introduces a set of other recently identified diseases that share common features with the traditional FDH diseases. The Review also discusses a new era for population-based studies, which combine various forms of big data to identify novel genotype-phenotype associations behind more complex conditions, as exemplified here by the FinnGen project. In addition to the pathogenic variants with an unequivocal causative role in the disease phenotype, several risk alleles that correlate with certain phenotypic features have been identified among the Finns, further emphasizing the broad value of studying genetically isolated populations.",Disease models & mechanisms,2022,"Finland; Translational Research, Biomedical; Phenotype",False,8

Per standard deviation increase in genetically predicted fatty acid levels, the combined odds ratio (OR) of VTE was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.92) for α-linolenic acid, 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.95) for linoleic acid, 0.85 (95% CI 0.78-0.92) for palmitoleic acid, 0.77 (95% CI 0.77-0.84) for oleic acid, 1.16 (95% CI 1.10-1.23) for eicosapentaenoic acid, 1.10 (95% CI 1.06-1.14) for docosapentaenoic acid, 1.06 (95% CI 1.04-1.08) for arachidonic acid, and 1.19 (95% CI 1.11-1.28) for stearic acid. Genetically predicted levels of docosahexaenoic acid or palmitoleic acid were not associated with VTE risk. Four and eight out of ten genetically predicted fatty acid levels were associated with risk of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, respectively.

FinnGen,35604428,Multi-Trait Genetic Analysis Reveals Clinically Interpretable Hypertension Subtypes.,"Hypertension comprises a heterogeneous range of phenotypes. We asked whether underlying genetic structure could explain a part of this heterogeneity. Our study sample comprised N=198 148 FinnGen participants (56% women, mean age 58 years) and N=21 168 well-phenotyped FINRISK participants (53% women, mean age 50 years). First, we identified genetic hypertension components with an unsupervised Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization algorithm using public genome-wide association data for 144 genetic hypertension variants and 16 clinical traits. For these components, we computed their (1) cross-sectional associations with clinical traits in FINRISK using linear regression and (2) longitudinal associations with incident adverse outcomes in FinnGen using Cox regression. We observed 4 genetic hypertension components corresponding to recognizable clinical phenotypes: obesity (high body mass index), dyslipidemia (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high triglycerides), hypolipidemia (low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low total cholesterol), and short stature. In FINRISK, all hypertension components had robust associations with their respective clinical characteristics. In FinnGen, the Obesity component was associated with increased diabetes risk (hazard ratio per 1 SD increase 1.08 [Bonferroni corrected CI, 1.05-1.10]) and the Hypolipidemia component with increased autoimmune disease risk (hazard ratio per 1 SD increase 1.05 [Bonferroni corrected CI, 1.03-1.07]). In addition, all hypertension components were related to both hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Our unsupervised analysis demonstrates that the genetic basis of hypertension can be understood as a mixture of 4 broad, clinically interpretable components capturing disease heterogeneity. These components could be used to stratify individuals into specific genetic subtypes and, therefore, to benefit personalized health care and pharmaceutical research.",Circulation.

FinnGen,36441335,Body mass index and the risk of abdominal hernia: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Abdominal hernia (AH) is one of the most common clinical diseases. A large number of observational studies have found that obesity is an important risk factor for AH. However, the causal relationship between obesity and AH cannot be determined because of the clinical studies on AH induced by obesity are relatively few and only have some small- or medium-scale observational studies. Observational studies have so many confounding factors and reverse causality due to their shortcomings. From an evidence-based medicine perspective, they are not sufficiently convincing. Therefore, there is still a lack of high-quality, evidence-based medical evidence supporting a causal relationship between obesity and AH. A causal relationship between obesity and AH is also almost impossible to confirm by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our study based on Mendelian randomization (MR) may provide a higher level of evidence-based medical support for the relationship between obesity and AH. Body mass index (BMI) is the most common measure used for defining obesity. Finally, we employed two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) to explore the causal relationship between BMI and AH. AH-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data were obtained from the FinnGen Biobank (FB), and BMI-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data were obtained from the UK Biobank (UKB). Genetic loci are used as instrumental variables (IVs), methods such as inverse variance weighted (IVW) were used for two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis, and the odds ratio (OR) value was used to evaluate the causal relationship between BMI and AH. The results of the horizontal pleiotropy test were calculated by Egger-intercept method: p = 0.34 > 0.05. The Cochran Q test of MR-Egger method and IVW method showed heterogeneity P = 0.03 < 0.05, so the IVW random effect model was used as the gold standard. We found a genetically determined 1-standard deviation (SD) increment of BMI causally increased a 66.0% risk of AH (N = 371 SNPs, OR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.46-1.89, p = 1.55E-14) based on the IVW random effect model which was almost consistent with the results of other seven methods. Our MR found genetic evidence for BMI and AH. The risk of developing AH increases with the number of BMI. This finding provides further evidence that maintaining a healthy BMI can prevent the development of AH. In addition, clinicians may need to focus on the potential risk of AH on some high-BMI patients.",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,2023,Humans; Body Mass Index; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Herniorrhaphy; Nonoxynol; Obesity,False,8
FinnGen,35680855,Comprehensive genome-wide association study of different forms of hernia identifies more than 80 associated loci.,"Hernias are characterized by protrusion of an organ or tissue through its surrounding cavity and often require surgical repair. In this study we identify 65,492 cases for five hernia types in the UK Biobank and perform genome-wide association study scans for these five types and two combined groups. Our results show associated variants in all scans. Inguinal hernia has the most associations and we conduct a follow-up study with 23,803 additional cases from four study groups giving 84 independently associated variants. Identified variants from all scans are collapsed into 81 independent loci. Further testing shows that 26 loci are associated with more than one hernia type, suggesting substantial overlap between the underlying genetic mechanisms. Pathway analyses identify several genes with a strong link to collagen and/or elastin (ADAMTS6, ADAMTS16, ADAMTSL3, LOX, ELN) in the vicinity of associated loci for inguinal hernia, which substantiates an essential role of connective tissue morphology.",Nature communications,2022,"Collagen; Follow-Up Studies; Genome-Wide Association Study; Hernia, Inguinal; Humans",False,8
FinnGen,35838494,Multinational Genome-Wide Association Study and Functional Genomics Analysis Implicates Decreased SIRT3 Expression Underlying Intracranial Aneurysm Risk.,"The genetic mechanisms regulating intracranial aneurysm (IA) formation and rupture are largely unknown. To identify germline-genetic risk factors for IA, we perform a multinational genome-wide association study (GWAS) of individuals from the United Kingdom, Finland, and Japan. To identify a shared, multinational genetic basis of IA. Using GWAS summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and Biobank Japan, we perform a meta-analysis of IA, containing ruptured and unruptured IA cases. Logistic regression was used to identify IA-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Effect size was calculated using the coefficient r , estimating the contribution of the single-nucleotide polymorphism to the genetic variance of the trait. Genome-wide significance was set at 5.0 × 10 -8 . Expression quantitative trait loci mapping and functional genomics approaches were used to infer mechanistic consequences of implicated variants. Our cohort contained 155 154 individuals (3132 IA cases and 152 022 controls). We identified 4 genetic loci reaching genome-wide: rs73392700 ( SIRT3 , effect size = 0.28, P = 4.3 × 10 -12 ), rs58721068 ( EDNRA , effect size = -0.20, P = 4.8 × 10 -12 ), rs4977574 ( AL359922.1 , effect size = 0.18, P = 7.9 × 10 -12 ), and rs11105337 ( ATP2B1 , effect size = -0.15, P = 3.4 × 10 -8 ). Expression quantitative trait loci mapping suggests that rs73392700 has a large effect size on SIRT3 gene expression in arterial and muscle, but not neurological, tissues. Functional genomics analysis suggests that rs73392700 causes decreased SIRT3 gene expression. We perform a multinational GWAS of IA and identify 4 genetic risk loci, including 2 novel IA risk loci ( SIRT3 and AL359922.1 ).

Ten lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with plasma vitamin C levels at the genome-wide significance level were used as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for 15 CVDs were obtained from corresponding genetic consortia, the UK Biobank study, and the FinnGen consortium. The inverse-variance-weighted method was the primary analysis method, supplemented by the weighted median and MR-Egger methods. Estimates for each CVD from different sources were combined. Genetically predicted vitamin C levels were not associated with any CVD after accounting for multiple testing. However, there were suggestive associations of higher genetically predicted vitamin C levels (per 1 standard deviation increase) with lower risk of cardioembolic stroke [odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.64, 0.99; P = 0.038] and higher risk of atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00, 1.18; P = 0.049) in the inverse-variance-weighted method and with lower risk of peripheral artery disease (odds ratio, 0.76, 95% CI, 0.62, 0.93; P = 0.009) in the weighted median method.

FinnGen,35765714,Causal associations between sleep traits and four cardiac diseases: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Previous studies investigated the associations between sleep traits and cardiac diseases, but the evidence for the causal inferences was unclear. This study aimed to explore the causal relationship between sleep and cardiac diseases by virtue of Mendelian randomization (MR). Summary-level data for exposure variables (sleep duration, chronotype, and insomnia) and outcome variables (ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and heart failure) were derived from UK Biobank. Data from the FinnGen consortium was used as a robustness check. In MR analysis, the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was applied to infer causality between exposure and outcome. MR-Egger regression was used to identify pleiotropy, and MR-PRESSO outlier test was used to remove the pleiotropy of the genetic instruments. Based on UK Biobank, MR analysis suggested that sleep duration was weakly associated with atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.9999, 95% CI: 0.9998-0.9999) and ischaemic heart disease (OR = 0.9997, 95% CI: 0.9995-0.9998). Insomnia was associated with ischaemic heart disease (OR = 1.0117, 95% CI: 1.0051-1.0183) and myocardial infarction (OR = 1.0049, 95% CI: 1.0019-1.0079). No associations were found between chronotype and cardiac diseases (P > 0.05). We did not find pleiotropy except for insomnia with ischaemic heart disease and myocardial infarction using MR-Egger regression, and MR-PRESSO analysis consistent with IVW. Finally, we obtained the same direction as with UK Biobank using the FinnGen data. Sleep duration and insomnia might be the potential causal risk factors of cardiac diseases.

FinnGen,35978133,Inframe insertion and splice site variants in MFGE8 associate with protection against coronary atherosclerosis.,"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of premature death and disability worldwide, with both genetic and environmental determinants. While genome-wide association studies have identified multiple genetic loci associated with cardiovascular diseases, exact genes driving these associations remain mostly uncovered. Due to Finland's population history, many deleterious and high-impact variants are enriched in the Finnish population giving a possibility to find genetic associations for protein-truncating variants that likely tie the association to a gene and that would not be detected elsewhere. In a large Finnish biobank study FinnGen, we identified an association between an inframe insertion rs534125149 in MFGE8 (encoding lactadherin) and protection against coronary atherosclerosis. This variant is highly enriched in Finland, and the protective association was replicated in meta-analysis of BioBank Japan and Estonian biobank. Additionally, we identified a protective association between splice acceptor variant rs201988637 in MFGE8 and coronary atherosclerosis, independent of the rs534125149, with no significant risk-increasing associations. This variant was also associated with lower pulse pressure, pointing towards a function of MFGE8 in arterial aging also in humans in addition to previous evidence in mice. In conclusion, our results suggest that inhibiting the production of lactadherin could lower the risk for coronary heart disease substantially.",Communications biology,2022,"Animals; Antigens, Surface; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronary Artery Disease; Genetic Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Mice; Milk Proteins; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8

Polymorphisms in the WRB (rs2244352) and TSPAN10 (rs6420484) genes were investigated in individuals from the FinnGen study group who had one of three categories of strabismus, with clinical diagnoses of (1) ""strabismus-all subtypes"" (3,515 cases and 173,384 controls), (2) ""convergent concomitant strabismus"" (ICD-10 code H50.0; 737 cases and 170,976 controls), and (3) ""divergent concomitant strabismus"" (ICD-10 code H50.1; 1,059 cases and 170,976 controls). The WRB polymorphism was associated with ""all subtypes"" of strabismus (OR = 1.08; P = 0.008) and divergent strabismus (OR = 1.11; P = 0.046) but not with convergent strabismus (P = 0.41). The WRB polymorphism had a population attributable risk of 3.4% for all strabismus subtypes and 4.7% for divergent strabismus. The TSPAN10 polymorphism was associated with all three strabismus phenotypes: ""all subtypes"" (OR = 1.08; P = 0.002), convergent strabismus (OR = 1.19; P = 0.001) and divergent strabismus (OR = 1.20; P =7.21E-05). The population attributable risk for the TSPAN10 polymorphism was 6.0% for any strabismus, 13.3% for convergent strabismus, and 13.9% for divergent strabismus.

We aimed to investigate the causal effect of maternal testosterone levels in the general population on offspring birth weight and preterm delivery risk using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method. We obtained independent genetic instruments from a sex-specific genome-wide association study with up to 230 454 females of European descent from the UK Biobank. Genetic instruments with consistent testosterone effects but no aggregate effect on sex hormone-binding globulin were used to perform the main analysis. Summary-level data of offspring birth weight adjusted for genotype were obtained from a study with 210 406 females of European descent. Summary-level data of preterm delivery were obtained from the FinnGen study (6736 cases and 116 219 controls).

To improve our understanding of the genetic factors underlying postoperative prognosis, we studied the association of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) with postprocedural complications in coronary patients who underwent revascularization. The study sample comprised 8,296, 6,132, and 13,082 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, or any revascularization, respectively. We genotyped all subjects and identified adverse events during follow-up of up to 30 years by record linkage with nationwide healthcare registers. We computed PRSs for each postoperative adverse outcome (atrial fibrillation [AF], myocardial infarction, stroke, and bleeding complications) for all participants. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between PRSs and outcomes. A 1-SD increase in AF-PRS was associated with greater risk of postoperative AF with hazard ratios of 1.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16 to 1.28), 1.15 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.20) and 1.18 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.22) after percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, and any revascularization, respectively. In contrast, the association of each PRSs with other postoperative complications was nonexistent to marginal. Inclusion of the AF-PRS in a model with a clinical risk score resulted in significant model improvement (increase in model c-statistic 0.0059 to 0.0098 depending on procedure; p <0.0002 for all). In conclusion, our results demonstrate that PRS can be used for AF risk-prediction in patients who underwent revascularization.

We obtained genome-wide association data for biological ageing from a meta-analysis (N = 34,710), and for cancer from the UK Biobank (N cases = 2671-13,879; N controls = 173,493-372,016), FinnGen (N cases = 719-8401; N controls = 74,685-174,006) and several international cancer genetic consortia (N cases = 11,348-122,977; N controls = 15,861-105,974). Main analyses were performed using multiplicative random effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) MR. Individual study estimates were pooled using fixed effect meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses included MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode and Causal Analysis using Summary Effect Estimates (CAUSE) methods, which are robust to some of the assumptions of the IVW approach. Meta-analysed IVW MR findings suggested that higher GrimAge acceleration increased the risk of colorectal cancer (OR = 1.12 per year increase in GrimAge acceleration, 95% CI 1.04-1.20, p = 0.002). The direction of the genetically predicted effects was consistent across main and sensitivity MR analyses. Among subtypes, the genetically predicted effect of GrimAge acceleration was greater for colon cancer (IVW OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.09-1.21, p = 0.006), than rectal cancer (IVW OR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.13, p = 0.24). Results were less consistent for associations between other epigenetic clocks and cancers. GrimAge acceleration may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Findings for other clocks and cancers were inconsistent. Further work is required to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the results.

Scientists have previously found that a chemical tag on DNA known as DNA methylation can be used to predict an individual’s chronological age. However, age predicted using DNA methylation (also known as biological or epigenetic age) does not always perfectly correspond to chronological age. Indeed, some people’s biological age is higher than their years, while other people’s is lower. When an individual’s biological age is higher than their chronological age, they are said to be experiencing ‘epigenetic age acceleration’. This type of accelerated ageing, which can be measured with ‘epigenetic clocks’ based on DNA methylation, has been associated with several adverse health outcomes, including cancer. This means that epigenetic clocks may improve our ability to predict cancer risk and detect cancer early. However, it is still unclear whether accelerated biological ageing causes cancer, or whether it simply correlates with the disease. Morales-Berstein et al. wanted to investigate whether epigenetic age acceleration, as measured by epigenetic clocks, plays a role in the development of several cancers. To do so, they used an approach known as Mendelian randomization. Using genetic variants as natural experiments, they studied the effect of different measures of epigenetic age acceleration on cancer risk. Their work focused on five types of cancer: breast, colorectal, prostate, ovarian and lung cancer. They used genetic association data from people of European ancestry to determine whether genetic variants that are strongly associated with accelerated ageing are also strongly associated with cancer. The results showed that one of the DNA methylation markers used as an estimate of biological ageing could be directly related to the risk of developing colorectal cancer. This work provides new insights into the relationship between markers of biological ageing and cancer. Similar relationships should also be studied in other groups of people and for other cancer sites. The results suggest that reversing biological ageing by altering DNA methylation could prevent or delay the development of colorectal cancer.",eLife,2022,"Colorectal Neoplasms; Epigenesis, Genetic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,0

Thus far, however, insights from prospective cohort studies and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses on this relationship are limited. We assessed the association between blood mtDNA-CN and incident type 2 diabetes using multivariable-adjusted regression analyses, and the associations between blood mtDNA-CN and type 2 diabetes and BMI using bi-directional MR. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the association between blood mtDNA-CN and incident type 2 diabetes in 285,967 unrelated European individuals from UK Biobank free of type 2 diabetes at baseline. Additionally, a cross-sectional analysis was performed to investigate the association between blood mtDNA-CN and BMI. We also assessed the potentially causal relationship between blood mtDNA-CN and type 2 diabetes (N=898,130 from DIAGRAM, N=215,654 from FinnGen) and BMI (N=681,275 from GIANT) using bi-directional two-sample MR. During a median follow-up of 11.87 years, 15,111 participants developed type 2 diabetes. Participants with a higher level of blood mtDNA-CN are at lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (HR 0.90 [95% CI 0.89, 0.92]). After additional adjustment for BMI and other confounders, these results attenuated moderately and remained present. The multivariable-adjusted cross-sectional analyses showed that higher blood mtDNA-CN was associated with lower BMI (-0.12 [95% CI -0.14, -0.10]) kg/m The results from the present study indicate that the observed association between low blood mtDNA-CN and higher risk of type 2 diabetes is likely not causal.",Diabetologia,2022,"Cross-Sectional Studies; DNA Copy Number Variations; DNA, Mitochondrial; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Mitochondria; Prospective Studies",False,8
FinnGen,36040623,Causal relationship of sugar-sweetened and sweet beverages with colorectal cancer: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Prospective cohort studies have suggested that sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) intake is significantly associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it remains unclear whether this observed association was susceptible to potential confounding factors due to the long-term development process of CRC, and the risk of CRC associated with sweet beverages has rarely been reported. We aimed to investigate the association between SSBs/sweet beverages and CRC risk. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using independent genetic variants for SSBs and sweet beverages from a published genome-wide association study (GWAS). Summary statistics for instrument-outcome associations from two databases for malignant neoplasms of the colon and the rectum (FinnGen and UK Biobank). The inverse weighted method (IVW) meta-analysis was the main method used to estimate the relationship, and sensitivity analyses were performed with Cochran's Q test, leave-one-out analysis, MR-Egger regression, Steiger filtering, and the MR PRESSO test. Genetically predicted SSBs intake was associated with a higher colonic malignant neoplasms risk (odds ratio (OR): 1.013; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.001, 1.026; P = 0.036) in a combined sample size of 579,986 individuals (4029 cases). Such a significant causal effect of SSBs on rectal malignant neoplasms or sweet beverages on CRC was not observed. Our findings corroborated a causal association between SSBs and colonic malignant neoplasms risk but did not support such a relationship in the analysis of the rectal malignant neoplasms nor the sweet beverage intake, which might be interpreted with caution and further confirmed.",European journal of nutrition,2023,"Humans; Colorectal Neoplasms; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prospective Studies; Sugar-Sweetened Beverages",False,8

FinnGen,36529488,Mendelian Randomization Study Does Not Support a Bidirectional Link between Atherosclerosis and Venous Thromboembolism.,"Some observational studies suggested that atherosclerosis increased the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and vice versa. However, the results were conflicting, and the causal relationship is yet to be established. Therefore, we applied Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess the bidirectional causality between coronary heart disease (CHD) and VTE, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). A total of 184,305 individuals with CHD were included from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium. Information on VTE, DVT, and PE were obtained from the FinnGen biobank. Genetic instruments for CHD and VTE were constructed using 37 and 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, respectively. Inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis under a random-effect model was used as the preliminary estimate. Five complementary MR methods were also used, including weighted median, MR-Egger, multivariable MR (adjusted for the body mass index), simple mode, and weighted mode methods. The genetically instrumented VTE (odds ratio [OR]: 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.11; P=0.06), DVT (OR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.99-1.08; P=0.19), or PE (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.98-1.16; P=0.11) showed no causal relationships with CHD. There was also no clear evidence showing the causal effects of CHD on VTE (OR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.82-1.22; P=0.98), DVT (OR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.79-1.27; P=0.97), or PE (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.82-1.18; P=0.87).

FinnGen,35366326,Appraising the Effect of Potential Risk Factors on Thyroid Cancer: A Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Various risk factors have been associated with the risk of thyroid cancer in observational studies. However, the causality of the risk factors is not clear given the susceptibility of confounding and reverse causation. A 2-sample Mendelian randomization approach was used to estimate the effect of potential risk factors on thyroid cancer risk. Genetic instruments to proxy 55 risk factors were identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Associations of these genetic variants with thyroid cancer risk were estimated in GWAS of the FinnGen Study (989 cases and 217 803 controls). A Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P = 9.09 × 10-4 was considered significant, and P < 0.05 was considered to be suggestive of an association. Telomere length was significantly associated with increased thyroid cancer risk after correction for multiple testing (OR 4.68; 95% CI, 2.35-9.31; P = 1.12 × 10-5). Suggestive associations with increased risk were noted for waist-to-hip ratio (OR 1.85; 95% CI, 1.02-3.35; P = 0.042) and diastolic blood pressure (OR 1.60; 95% CI, 1.08-2.38; P = 0.019). Suggestive associations were noted between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (OR 0.20; 95% CI, 0.05-0.82; P = 0.025) and decreased risk of thyroid cancer. Risk of thyroid cancer was not associated with sex hormones and reproduction, developmental and growth, lipids, diet and lifestyle, or inflammatory factors (All P > 0.05). Our study identified several potential targets for primary prevention of thyroid cancer, including central obesity, diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c, and telomere length, which should inform public health policy.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2022,"Genome-Wide Association Study; Glycated Hemoglobin; Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Thyroid Neoplasms",False,2
FinnGen,36347255,Systematic comparison of family history and polygenic risk across 24 common diseases.,"Family history is the standard indirect measure of inherited susceptibility in clinical care, whereas polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have more recently demonstrated potential for more directly capturing genetic risk in many diseases. Few studies have systematically compared how these overlap and complement each other across common diseases. Within FinnGen (N = 306,418), we leverage family relationships, up to 50 years of nationwide registries, and genome-wide genotyping to examine the interplay of family history and genome-wide PRSs. We explore the dynamic for three types of family history across 24 common diseases: first- and second-degree family history and parental causes of death. Covering a large proportion of the burden of non-communicable diseases in adults, we show that family history and PRS are independent and not interchangeable measures, but instead provide complementary information on inherited disease susceptibility. The PRSs explained on average 10% of the effect of first-degree family history, and first-degree family history 3% of PRSs, and PRS effects were independent of both early- and late-onset family history. The PRS stratified the risk similarly in individuals with and without family history. In most diseases, including coronary artery disease, glaucoma, and type 2 diabetes, a positive family history with a high PRS was associated with a considerably elevated risk, whereas a low PRS compensated completely for the risk implied by positive family history. This study provides a catalogue of risk estimates for both family history of disease and PRSs and highlights opportunities for a more comprehensive way of assessing inherited disease risk across common diseases.",American journal of human genetics,2022,"Adult; Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Multifactorial Inheritance; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Medical History Taking; Risk Factors",False,7
FinnGen,34648375,Polygenic risk provides biological validity for the ICHD-3 criteria among Finnish migraine families.,"Migraine is diagnosed using the extensively field-tested International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) consensus criteria derived by the International Headache Society. To evaluate the criteria in respect to a measurable biomarker, we studied the relationship between the main ICHD-3 criteria and the polygenic risk score, a measure of common variant burden in migraine. We used linear mixed models to study the correlation of ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria, underlying symptoms, and main diagnoses with the polygenic risk score of migraine in a cohort of 8602 individuals from the Finnish Migraine Genome Project. Main diagnostic categories and all underlying diagnostic criteria formed a consistent continuum along the increasing polygenic burden. Polygenic risk was associated with the heterogeneous clinical picture starting from the non-migraine headache (mean 0.07; 95% CI 0.02-0.12;  The complex migraine phenotype progressively follows the polygenic burden from individuals with no headache to non-migrainous headache and up to patients with attacks manifesting all the features of the ICHD-3 headache and aura.

FinnGen,36741373,Impact of ankylosing spondylitis on stroke limited to specific subtypes: Evidence from Mendelian randomization study.,"The relationship between Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and the risk of stroke is complex. Therefore, we utilized Two-Sample Mendelian randomization to examine the probable causal link between these two features. The genetic instruments linked to AS were chosen from a summary-level genetic data set from the FinnGen consortium in people of European ancestry (1462 cases and 164,682 controls). Stroke and its subtypes were selected as outcomes, and the MEGASTROKE consortium population was used to identify the genetic associations of AS on stroke (40,585 cases and 406,111 controls), ischemic stroke (IS) (34,217 cases and 406,111 controls), and its subtypes including large artery stroke (LAS) (4373 cases and 146,392 controls), small vessel stroke (SVS) (5386 cases and 192,662 controls), and cardioembolic stroke (CES) (7193 cases and 204,570 controls). Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (1687 cases and 201,146 controls) data set from the FinnGen consortium was also used. To obtain the casual estimates, the inverse variant weighted (IVW) method was mainly used. By examining the heterogeneity and pleiotropy of particular single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the robustness of the results was also examined. There was no evidence found to prove the correlation between genetically predicted AS and stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.014; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.999-1.031; P = 0.063), ICH (OR 1.030; 95% CI 0.995-1.067; P = 0.090), and IS (OR 1.013; 95% CI 0. 998-1.030; P = 0.090). In terms of the different subtypes of IS, there was strong evidence of positive causal inferences on CES (OR 1.051; 95% CI 1.022-1.081; P = 0.001), and suggestive evidence of positive causal inferences on LAS (OR 1.042; 95% CI 1.003-1.082; P = 0.033), while it was not significant for SVS (OR 1.010; 95% CI 0.975-1.047; P = 0.563).

FinnGen,34791234,Leveraging Northern European population history: novel low-frequency variants for polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Can we identify novel variants associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by leveraging the unique population history of Northern Europe? We identified three novel genome-wide significant associations with PCOS, with two putative independent causal variants in the checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) gene and a third in myosin X (MYO10). PCOS is a common, complex disorder with unknown aetiology. While previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped several loci associated with PCOS, the analysis of populations with unique population history and genetic makeup has the potential to uncover new low-frequency variants with larger effects. A population-based case-control GWAS was carried out. We identified PCOS cases from national registers by ICD codes (ICD-10 E28.2, ICD-9 256.4, or ICD-8 256.90), and all remaining women were considered controls. We then conducted a three-stage case-control GWAS: in the discovery phase, we had a total of 797 cases and 140 558 controls from the FinnGen study. For validation, we used an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank, including 2812 cases and 89 230 controls. Finally, we performed a joint meta-analysis of 3609 cases and 229 788 controls from both cohorts. Additionally, we reran the association analyses including BMI as a covariate, with 2169 cases and 160 321 controls from both cohorts. Two out of the three novel genome-wide significant variants associating with PCOS, rs145598156 (P = 3.6×10-8, odds ratio (OR) = 3.01 [2.02-4.50] minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.005) and rs182075939 (P = 1.9×10-16, OR = 1.69 [1.49-1.91], MAF = 0.04), were found to be enriched in the Finnish and Estonian populations and are tightly linked to a deletion c.1100delC (r2 = 0.95) and a missense I157T (r2 = 0.83) in CHEK2. The third novel association is a common variant near MYO10 (rs9312937, P = 1.7 × 10-8, OR = 1.16 [1.10-1.23], MAF = 0.44). We also replicated four previous reported associations near the genes Erb-B2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 4 (ERBB4), DENN Domain Containing 1A (DENND1A), FSH Subunit Beta (FSHB) and Zinc Finger And BTB Domain Containing 16 (ZBTB16). When adding BMI as a covariate only one of the novel variants remained genome-wide significant in the meta-analysis (the EstBB lead signal in CHEK2 rs182075939, P = 1.9×10-16, OR = 1.74 [1.5-2.01]) possibly owing to reduced sample size. The age- and BMI-adjusted GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics are available for download from the GWAS Catalog with accession numbers GCST90044902 and GCST90044903. The main limitation was the low prevalence of PCOS in registers; however, the ones with the diagnosis most likely represent the most severe cases. Also, BMI data were not available for all (63% for FinnGen, 76% for EstBB), and the biobank setting limited the accessibility of PCOS phenotypes and laboratory values. This study encourages the use of isolated populations to perform genetic association studies for the identification of rare variants contributing to the genetic landscape of complex diseases such as PCOS.

FinnGen,34862199,Recessive Genome-Wide Meta-analysis Illuminates Genetic Architecture of Type 2 Diabetes.,"Most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits are performed using models with additive allelic effects. Hundreds of loci associated with type 2 diabetes have been identified using this approach. Additive models, however, can miss loci with recessive effects, thereby leaving potentially important genes undiscovered. We conducted the largest GWAS meta-analysis using a recessive model for type 2 diabetes. Our discovery sample included 33,139 case subjects and 279,507 control subjects from 7 European-ancestry cohorts, including the UK Biobank. We identified 51 loci associated with type 2 diabetes, including five variants undetected by prior additive analyses. Two of the five variants had minor allele frequency of <5% and were each associated with more than a doubled risk in homozygous carriers. Using two additional cohorts, FinnGen and a Danish cohort, we replicated three of the variants, including one of the low-frequency variants, rs115018790, which had an odds ratio in homozygous carriers of 2.56 (95% CI 2.05-3.19; P = 1 × 10-16) and a stronger effect in men than in women (for interaction, P = 7 × 10-7). The signal was associated with multiple diabetes-related traits, with homozygous carriers showing a 10% decrease in LDL cholesterol and a 20% increase in triglycerides; colocalization analysis linked this signal to reduced expression of the nearby PELO gene. These results demonstrate that recessive models, when compared with GWAS using the additive approach, can identify novel loci, including large-effect variants with pathophysiological consequences relevant to type 2 diabetes.",Diabetes,2022,"Adult; Cholesterol, LDL; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Europe; Female; Gene Frequency; Genes, Recessive; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Homozygote; Humans; Male; Metabolome; Middle Aged; Mutation; Sex Factors; Triglycerides",False,0

This study aims to evaluate this causal association with two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Inverse-variance weighted was used as the major analysis method of MR. Genetic variants associated with dietary antioxidants including vitamin E (α- and γ-tocopherol), β-carotene, lycopene, vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid or ascorbate), and retinol, and their circulating metabolites were used as instrumental variables. The causal effects of the antioxidants were assessed in genome-wide association study datasets of RA from a previous publication (Okada Y. et al.) and Finngen consortium and combined with meta-analysis. We observed that the levels of circulating retinol metabolite negatively correlates with the risk of overall RA in the dataset from Okada Y. et al. (odds ratio [OR]=0.952, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.911-0.996, p = 0.031) and Finngen (OR=0.946, 95%CI=0.903-0.991, p = 0.020). The causal association remained consistent in the meta-analysis (OR=0.949, 95%CI=0.919-0.98, p = 0.002). Increased levels of circulating retinol metabolite also suggestively decreased the risk of seropositive RA (OR=0.936, 95%CI=0.884-0.992, p = 0.025) but not seronegative RA (OR=0.996, 95%CI=0.921-1.076, p = 0.913). No causal effects of other dietary antioxidants on RA were identified in our analyses.

Whether these associations are causal remains controversial, due to confounding factors and reverse causality. We aim to investigate the causality of these associations using Mendelian randomization method. Instrumental variables were obtained from the largest genome-wide association studies of serum urate (457,690 individuals) to date. Summary statistics were from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (60,801 CHD cases; 43,676 MI cases), FinnGen (21,012 CHD cases; 12,801 MI cases), UK Biobank (10,157 CHD cases; 7018 MI cases), and Biobank Japan (29,319 CHD cases). Inverse-variance weighted method was applied as the main results. Other statistical methods and reverse MR analysis were conducted in the supplementary analyses.

Nevertheless, whether these associations are causal remain controversial, due to confounding factors (e.g., physical activity) and reverse causality. Instrumental variables were obtained from the largest genome-wide association studies of sedentary behavior (408,815 individuals) to date. We obtained summary statistics of MI from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (171,875 individuals), HF from the HERMES Consortium (977,323 individuals), and AF from the Atrial Fibrillation Consortium (588,190 individuals). The inverse-variance weighted method was applied to obtain Mendelian randomization (MR) estimates, and other statistical methods were conducted in the sensitivity analyses. The main analyses were repeated using data from the FinnGen study. Multivariable MR analysis and mediation analysis were performed to evaluate the role of physical activity and other confounders. Genetically determined television watching was associated with MI (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% CI, 1.19-1.59; p = 1.9 × 10 Genetic liability to prolonged television watching is associated with higher risks of MI and HF.

We aimed to determine if four germline genetic polymorphisms, rs429358 in apolipoprotein E (APOE), rs2642438 in mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component 1 (MARC1), rs2792751 in glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAM), and rs187429064 in transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2), previously associated with progressive alcohol-related and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, are also associated with HCC. Four HCC case-control data sets were constructed, including two mixed etiology data sets (UK Biobank and FinnGen); one hepatitis C virus (HCV) cohort (STOP-HCV), and one alcohol-related HCC cohort (Dresden HCC). The frequency of each variant was compared between HCC cases and cirrhosis controls (i.e., patients with cirrhosis without HCC). Population controls were also considered. Odds ratios (ORs) associations were calculated using logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, and principal components of genetic ancestry. Fixed-effect meta-analysis was used to determine the pooled effect size across all data sets. Across four case-control data sets, 2,070 HCC cases, 4,121 cirrhosis controls, and 525,779 population controls were included. The rs429358:C allele (APOE) was significantly less frequent in HCC cases versus cirrhosis controls (OR, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-0.84; P = 2.9 × 10",Hepatology communications,2022,"Apolipoproteins E; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Hepatitis C; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Neoplasms; Membrane Proteins; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8

Previous studies have revealed various risk factors associated with alopecia. However, the relationship between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and non-scarring alopecia remains unclear. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to evaluate the causality between genetically predicted LTL and the risk of non-scarring alopecia. MR analyses were performed using the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method and complemented with other MR methods. The summary statistics of the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for AGA and AA were obtained from the FinnGen biobank, which included 119,185 and 211,428 individuals, respectively. A total of 126 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with genome-wide significance were selected as the instrumental variables for LTL. The MR analyses suggested a causal relationship between LTL and AGA, and the risk of AGA increased by 3.19 times as the genetically predicted LTL was shortened by one standard deviation in log transformed form under the IVW method (OR = 4.19, 95% CI = 1.20-14.61,  Our results suggested a potential causal relationship between LTL and AGA, and shortened LTL was associated with an increased risk of AGA.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Alopecia Areata; Leukocytes; Telomere,False,7
FinnGen,36114182,Efficient and accurate frailty model approach for genome-wide survival association analysis in large-scale biobanks.,"With decades of electronic health records linked to genetic data, large biobanks provide unprecedented opportunities for systematically understanding the genetics of the natural history of complex diseases. Genome-wide survival association analysis can identify genetic variants associated with ages of onset, disease progression and lifespan. We propose an efficient and accurate frailty model approach for genome-wide survival association analysis of censored time-to-event (TTE) phenotypes by accounting for both population structure and relatedness. Our method utilizes state-of-the-art optimization strategies to reduce the computational cost. The saddlepoint approximation is used to allow for analysis of heavily censored phenotypes (>90%) and low frequency variants (down to minor allele count 20). We demonstrate the performance of our method through extensive simulation studies and analysis of five TTE phenotypes, including lifespan, with heavy censoring rates (90.9% to 99.8%) on ~400,000 UK Biobank participants with white British ancestry and ~180,000 individuals in FinnGen.

Hitherto, total and direct causal effects of general- and central obesity on PCOS have not been comprehensively analyzed. To investigate the causality of central- and general obesity on PCOS using surrogate anthropometric markers. Summary GWAS data of female-only, large-sample cohorts of European ancestry were retrieved for anthropometric markers of central obesity (waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)) and general obesity (BMI and its constituent variables-weight and height), from the IEU Open GWAS Project. As the outcome, we acquired summary data from a large-sample GWAS (118870 samples; 642 cases and 118228 controls) within the FinnGen cohort. Total causal effects were assessed via univariable two-sample Mendelian randomization (2SMR). Genetic architectures underlying causal associations were explored. Direct causal effects were analyzed by multivariable MR modelling. Instrumental variables demonstrated no weak instrument bias (F > 10). Four anthropometric exposures, namely, weight (2.69-77.05), BMI (OR: 2.90-4.06), WC (OR: 6.22-20.27), and HC (OR: 6.22-20.27) demonstrated total causal effects as per univariable 2SMR models. We uncovered shared and non-shared genetic architectures underlying causal associations. Direct causal effects of WC and HC on PCOS were revealed by two multivariable MR models containing exclusively the anthropometric markers of central obesity. Other multivariable MR models containing anthropometric markers of both central- and general obesity showed no direct causal effects on PCOS. Both and general- and central obesity yield total causal effects on PCOS. Findings also indicated potential direct causal effects of normal weight-central obesity and more complex causal mechanisms when both central- and general obesity are present.

FinnGen,35429337,Higher genetically predicted low-density lipoprotein levels increase the renal cancer risk independent of triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein levels: A Mendelian randomization study.,"The causation between lipids and renal cancer remains inconclusive. Our purpose is to explore the causal relationships between the three primary lipid metabolism-related substances, namely triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) with the risk of renal cancer using Mendelian randomization (MR) methods. Genetic instruments for lipids were acquired from the UK Biobank. Outcome data were from the FinnGen study (1397 renal cancer cases and 204 070). Single-variable MR (SVMR) and multi-variable MR (MVMR) analyses were conducted with TwoSampleMR package based on R 4.0.3. The random-effect inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted-median method, and weighted mode were the four main computing methods. We found that per 1 SD elevated LDL level was causally associated with renal cancer occurrence based on SVMR (OR, 1.31, 95% CI: 1.05-1.64, P = .016). Similar significant associations were found in other methods. However, the results of SVMR did not support significant associations between TG, and HDL with renal cancer risk in all methods. The association between LDL and renal cancer was still significant in MVMR analysis (OR for IVW method: 1.22 per 1 SD higher trait (SD, 95% CI: 1.11-1.34, P < .001; OR for MR-Egger: 1.22 per 1 SD higher trait, 95% CI: 1.01-1.47, P = .042) when taking TG and HDL into consideration.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether CA levels are related to the risk of AS. We carried out a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine the causal correlation between CA levels and AS via published genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to CA levels were derived from a large GWAS that included 39,883 individuals of European descent.

Independent genetic variants associated with fasting glucose (FG), 2 h glucose after an oral glucose challenge (2hGlu), fasting insulin (FI), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at the genome-wide significance threshold were used as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for 12 atherosclerotic and 4 thrombotic outcomes were obtained from large genetic consortia and the FinnGen and UK Biobank studies. Higher levels of genetically predicted glycemic traits were consistently associated with increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis-related diseases and symptoms. Genetically predicted glycemic traits except HbA1c showed positive associations with peripheral artery disease risk. Genetically predicted FI levels were positively associated with risk of ischemic stroke and chronic kidney disease. Genetically predicted FG and 2hGlu were positively associated with risk of large artery stroke. Genetically predicted 2hGlu levels showed positive associations with risk of small vessel stroke. Higher levels of genetically predicted glycemic traits were not associated with increased risk of thrombotic outcomes. Most associations for genetically predicted levels of 2hGlu and FI remained after adjustment for other glycemic traits.

This study aimed to determine the causality of the associations of plasma phospholipid AA with NALFD, cirrhosis, and liver cancer using Mendelian randomization analysis. Nine independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with plasma phospholipid AA at the genome-wide significance were used as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for three outcomes were obtained from 1) a genome-wide association study for NAFLD, 2) the UK Biobank study, and 3) the FinnGen study. The sensitivity analysis excluding the pleiotropic variant rs174547 in the FADS1 gene was performed. Estimates from different sources were combined using the fixed-effects meta-analysis method. Per standard deviation increase in AA levels, the combined odds ratio was 1.06 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.11; P = 0.008) for NAFLD, 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.09; P = 0.009) for cirrhosis, and 0.99 (95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.05; P = 0.765) for liver cancer.

We here explore the causal relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria, two principal measurements of CKD, and 19 site-specific cancers using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms reported to be strongly correlated with eGFR and albuminuria in recent large genome-wide association studies were used as instrumental variables to investigate the causal relationship with cancer using summary-level statistics from several cancer-specific consortia, as well as data of 347,408 participants in the UK Biobank and 260,405 participants in the FinnGen. Our data showed that impaired kidney function was associated with higher odds of leukemia [OR = 1.23; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.43; P = 0.007], cervical cancer (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.43; P = 0.017), and female renal cell carcinoma (OR = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.12-1.77; P = 0.004), per 10% decrease in eGFR.

However, there is limited evidence about the causal effect of blood metabolites on the cholelithiasis risk. To have a comprehensive understanding to causal relations between blood metabolites and cholelithiasis, for the primary discovery, we applied two MR methods to explore the associations between 249 circulating metabolites and cholelithiasis. For secondary validations, we replicated the examinations using another metabolic dataset with 123 metabolites. The summary statistics of cholelithiasis were retrieved from FinnGen Consortium Release 5 and UK Biobank. Inverse-variance weighted, weight median and MR-egger methods were used for calculating causal estimates. Furthermore, Bayesian model averaging MR (MR-BMA) method was employed to detect the dominant causal metabolic traits with adjustment for pleiotropy effects. In the primary analysis, sphingomyelin showed consistent protective causal associations with cholelithiasis; while plasma cholesterol-associated traits showed generally inverse correlation with cholelithiasis risk. Notably, large numbers of traits within the (un)saturated fatty acid category demonstrated significant causal effects. Secondary analyses demonstrated similar results, with traits related to the levels of bisallylic groups in fatty acids showing protective effects. Lastly, MR-BMA analyses discovered that the degree of unsaturation plays a predominant role in reducing the risk of cholelithiasis.

We examined whether a generic blood pressure polygenic risk score (BP-PRS), compared with a preeclampsia-specific polygenic risk score (PE-PRS), could better predict hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Our study sample included 141 298 genotyped FinnGen study participants with at least one childbirth and followed from 1969 to 2021. We calculated PRSs for SBP and preeclampsia using summary statistics for greater than 1.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. We observed 8488 cases of gestational hypertension (GHT) and 6643 cases of preeclampsia. BP-PRS was associated with GHT [multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for 1SD increase in PRS (hazard ratio 1.38; 95% CI 1.35-1.41)] and preeclampsia (1.26, 1.23-1.29), respectively. The PE-PRS was also associated with GHT (1.16; 1.14-1.19) and preeclampsia (1.21, 1.18-1.24), but with statistically more modest magnitudes of effect (P = 0.01). The model c-statistic for preeclampsia improved when PE-PRS was added to clinical risk factors (P = 4.6 × 10-15). Additional increment in the c-statistic was observed when BP-PRS was added to a model already including both clinical risk factors and PE-PRS (P = 1.1 × 10-14). BP-PRS is strongly associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Our current observations suggest that the BP-PRS could capture the genetic architecture of preeclampsia better than the current PE-PRSs.

The impact of genetics is known for chronic back pain: its heritability is estimated to be at least 40%. Large genome-wide association studies have shown that common variation may account for up to 35% of chronic back pain heritability; rare variants may explain a portion of the heritability not explained by common variants. In this study, we performed the first gene-based association analysis of chronic back pain using UK Biobank imputed data including rare variants with moderate imputation quality. We discovered 2 genes, SOX5 and PANX3 , influencing chronic back pain. The SOX5 gene is a well-known back pain gene. The PANX3 gene has not previously been described as having a role in chronic back pain. We showed that the association of PANX3 with chronic back pain is driven by rare noncoding intronic polymorphisms. This result was replicated in an independent sample from UK Biobank and validated using a similar phenotype, dorsalgia, from FinnGen Biobank. We also found that the PANX3 gene is associated with intervertebral disk disorders.

The summary data on urticaria were derived from FinnGen Data Freeze 2. The summary data on RA were obtained from a published meta-analysis using European samples. Four MR methods were applied to the MR estimates. Three heterogeneity tests, including Cochran's Q test, single variant analysis, and leave-one-out variant analysis, were used. The pleiotropy and horizontal pleiotropy among instrumental variables were assessed with MR-Egger regression intercept, MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier global test, and PhenoScanner. The MR analysis suggested that urticaria was causally associated with RA (odds ratio = 1.114, 95% confidence interval = 1.024-1.211, p = .011). No genetic pleiotropy or horizontal pleiotropy was revealed by MR-Egger regression intercept and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier global test. The sensitivity analysis results were relatively robust. The MR analysis suggested there was sufficient evidence to indicate urticaria is the cause of RA.",Modern rheumatology,2022,"Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Urticaria",False,2
FinnGen,35811520,Assessment of the Causal Effect of IgG N-Glycosylation Level on Risk of Dementia: A 2-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Previous prospective studies highlighted aberrant immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation as a risk factor for dementia [such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD)]. It is unclear whether this association is causal or explained by confounding or reverse causation. The aim is to examine the association of genetically predicted IgG N-glycosylation with dementia using 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). Independent genetic variants for IgG N-glycosylation traits were selected as instrument variables from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) among individuals of European ancestry. We extracted their corresponding summary statistics from large-scale clinically diagnosed AD GWAS dataset and FinnGen biobank VaD GWAS dataset. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) was performed to calculate the effect estimates. Meanwhile, multiple sensitivity analyses were used to assess horizontal pleiotropy and outliers. There were no associations of genetically predicted IgG N-glycosylation traits with the risk of AD and VaD using the IVW method (all Bonferroni corrected p > 0.0013). These estimates of four additional sensitivity analyses methods were consistent with the IVW estimates in terms of direction and magnitude. Additionally, the MR-PRESSO global test and the intercept of MR-Egger regression indicated no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy. Meanwhile, the heterogeneity test showed no significant heterogeneity using the Cochran Q statistic. The leave-one-out sensitivity analyses also did not detect any significant change. Our MR study did not support evidence for the hypothesis that IgG N-glycosylation level may be causally associated with the risk of dementia.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022,"Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Glycosylation; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8
FinnGen,35594287,Mendelian randomization analysis of plasma levels of CD209 and MICB proteins and the risk of varicose veins of lower extremities.,"Varicose veins of lower extremities (VVs) are a highly prevalent condition, the pathogenesis of which is still not fully elucidated. Mendelian randomization (MR) can provide useful preliminary information on the traits that are potentially causally related to the disease. The aim of the present study is to replicate the effects of the plasma levels of MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B (MICB) and cluster of differentiation 209 (CD209) proteins reported in a previous hypothesis-free MR study. We conducted MR analysis using a fixed effects inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis of Wald ratios method. For MICB and CD209, we used data from a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) for plasma protein levels (N = 3,301). For VVs, we used GWAS data obtained in the FinnGen project (N = 128,698), the eMERGE network (phase 3, N = 48,429), and the UK Biobank data available in the Gene ATLAS (N = 452,264). The data used in the study were obtained in individuals of European descent. The results for MICB did not pass criteria for statistical significance and replication. The results for CD209 passed all statistical significance thresholds, indicating that the genetically predicted increase in CD209 level is associated with increased risk of VVs (βMR (SE) = 0.07 (0.01), OR (95% CI) = 1.08 (1.05-1.10), P-value = 5.9 ×10-11 in the meta-analysis of three cohorts). Our findings provide further support that CD209 can potentially be involved in VVs. In future studies, independent validation of our results using data from more powerful GWASs for CD209 measured by different methods would be beneficial.",PloS one,2022,"Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Lower Extremity; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Varicose Veins",False,2

We introduce an approach to estimate the effect of genetic risk factors on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; 'lost healthy life years'). We use genetic information from 735,748 individuals and consider 80 diseases. Rare variants had the highest effect on DALYs at the individual level. Among common variants, rs3798220 (LPA) had the strongest individual-level effect, with 1.18 DALYs from carrying 1 versus 0 copies. Being in the top 10% versus the bottom 90% of a polygenic score for multisite chronic pain had an effect of 3.63 DALYs. Some common variants had a population-level effect comparable to modifiable risk factors such as high sodium intake and low physical activity. Attributable DALYs vary between males and females for some genetic exposures.

FinnGen,35968571,Genome-Wide 3'-UTR Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Association Study Identifies Significant Prostate Cancer Risk-Associated Functional Loci at 8p21.2 in Chinese Population.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of gene expression via incomplete base pairing to sequence motifs at the three prime untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of mRNAs and play critical roles in the etiology of cancers. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3'-UTR miRNA-binding regions may influence the miRNA affinity. However, this biological mechanism in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. Here, a three-stage genome-wide association study of 3'-UTR SNPs (n=33 117) is performed in 5515 Chinese men. Three genome-wide significant variants are discovered at 8p21.2 (rs1567669, rs4872176, and rs4872177), which are all located in a linkage disequilibrium region of the NKX3-1 gene. Phenome-wide association analysis using the FinnGen data reveals a specific association of rs1567669 with PCa over 2,264 disease endpoints. Expression quantitative trait locus analyses based on both Chinese PCa cohort and the GTEx database show that risk alleles of these SNPs are significantly associated with low expression of NKX3-1. Based on the MirSNP database, dual-luciferase reporter assays show that risk alleles of these SNPs downregulate the expression of NKX3-1 via increased miRNA binding. These results indicate that the SNPs at the 3'-UTR of NKX3-1 significantly downregulate NKX3-1 expression by influencing the affinity of miRNA and increase the PCa risk.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2022,"3' Untranslated Regions; China; Genome-Wide Association Study; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prostatic Neoplasms; Transcription Factors",False,0
FinnGen,34763054,Risk of lower respiratory tract infections: a genome-wide association study with Mendelian randomization analysis in three independent European populations.,"Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Few studies have previously investigated genetic susceptibility and potential risk factors for LRTI. We used data from the UK Biobank, Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), and FinnGen to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Cases were subjects hospitalized with LRTI, and controls were subjects with no such hospitalization. We conducted stratification and interaction analyses to evaluate whether the genetic effect of LRTI differed by sex or smoking. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to identify the unconfounded relationship between cardiometabolic risk factors and LRTI. A total of 25 320 cases and 575 294 controls were included. The 15q25.1 locus reached genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis (rs10519203: OR 0.94, p 3.87e-11). The protective effect of effect allele of rs10519203 was present among smokers (OR 0.90, 95%CI 0.87-0.92, p 1.38e-15) but not among never-smokers (OR 1.01, 95%CI 0.97-1.06, p 5.20e-01). In MR analyses, we found that increasing body mass index (OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.24-1.40, p 3.78e-18), lifetime smoking (OR 2.83, 95%CI 2.34-3.42, p 6.56e-27), and systolic blood pressure robustly increased the risk of LRTIs (OR 1.11, 95%CI 1.02-1.22, p 1.48e-02).

Additionally, we report frequencies of key pharmacogenetic variants in individuals with a psychotic disorder from the genetically bottle-necked population of Finland. We combined GWAS chip and CYP2D6 CNV data from the Breast Cancer Pain Genetics study to construct an imputation panel (n = 902) for CYP2D6 CNV. The resulting data set was used as a CYP2D6 CNV imputation panel in 9262 non-related individuals from the SUPER-Finland study.

FinnGen,36864689,Potential drug targets for multiple sclerosis identified through Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Multiple sclerosis is a complex autoimmune disease, and several therapies for multiple sclerosis have been developed and widely used. However, existing medications for multiple sclerosis were far from satisfactory due to their failure to suppress relapses and alleviate disease progression. Novel drug targets for multiple sclerosis prevention are still needed. We performed Mendelian randomization to explore potential drug targets for multiple sclerosis using summary statistics from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (nCase = 47 429, nControl = 68 374) and further replicated in UK Biobank (nCase = 1356, nControl = 395 209) and FinnGen cohorts (nCase = 1326, nControl = 359 815). Genetic instruments for 734 plasma and 154 CSF proteins were obtained from recently published genome-wide association studies. The reverse causality detection using bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis and Steiger filtering, Bayesian co-localization, and phenotype scanning that searched previously reported genetic variant-trait associations were implemented to consolidate the Mendelian randomization findings further. In addition, the protein-protein interaction network was performed to reveal potential associations among proteins and/or present multiple sclerosis medications. At Bonferroni significance (P < 5.63 × 10-5), Mendelian randomization analysis revealed six protein-multiple sclerosis pairs. In plasma, per standard deviation increase in FCRL3, TYMP and AHSG had a protective effect. Odds ratios for the proteins above were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79-0.89), 0.59 (95% CI, 0.48-0.71) and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.94), respectively. In CSF, per 10-fold increase in MMEL1 (OR, 5.03; 95% CI, 3.42-7.41) increased the risk of multiple sclerosis, while SLAMF7 (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.29-0.60) and CD5L (OR, 0.30; 95%CI, 0.18-0.52) decreased the risk. None of the six proteins had reverse causality. Bayesian co-localization suggested that FCRL3 [coloc.abf-posterior probability of hypothesis 4 (PPH4) = 0.889], TYMP (coloc.susie-PPH4 = 0.896), AHSG (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.957, coloc.susie-PPH4 = 0.973), MMEL1 (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.930) and SLAMF7 (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.947) shared the same variant with multiple sclerosis. FCRL3, TYMP and SLAMF7 interacted with target proteins of current multiple sclerosis medications. MMEL1 was replicated in both UK Biobank and FinnGen cohorts. Our integrative analysis suggested that genetically determined levels of circulating FCRL3, TYMP, AHSG, CSF MMEL1 and SLAMF7 had causal effects on multiple sclerosis risk. These findings suggested those five proteins might be promising drug targets for multiple sclerosis and warrant further clinical investigation, especially FCRL3 and SLAMF7.",Brain : a journal of neurology,2023,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Multiple Sclerosis; Bayes Theorem; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,2

FinnGen,37726845,Identification of novel protein biomarkers and drug targets for colorectal cancer by integrating human plasma proteome with genome.,"The proteome is a major source of therapeutic targets. We conducted a proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to identify candidate protein markers and therapeutic targets for colorectal cancer (CRC). Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) were derived from seven published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on plasma proteome, and summary-level data were extracted for 4853 circulating protein markers. Genetic associations with CRC were obtained from a large-scale GWAS meta-analysis (16,871 cases and 26,328 controls), the FinnGen cohort (4957 cases and 304,197 controls), and the UK Biobank (9276 cases and 477,069 controls). Colocalization and summary-data-based MR (SMR) analyses were performed sequentially to verify the causal role of candidate proteins. Single cell-type expression analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI), and druggability evaluation were further conducted to detect the specific cell type with enrichment expression and prioritize potential therapeutic targets. Collectively, genetically predicted levels of 13 proteins were associated with CRC risk. Elevated levels of two proteins (GREM1, CHRDL2) and decreased levels of 11 proteins were associated with an increased risk of CRC, among which four (GREM1, CLSTN3, CSF2RA, CD86) were prioritized with the most convincing evidence. These protein-coding genes are mainly expressed in tissue stem cells, epithelial cells, and monocytes in colon tumor tissue. Two interactive pairs of proteins (GREM1 and CHRDL2; MMP2 and TIMP2) were identified to be involved in osteoclast differentiation and tumorigenesis pathways; four proteins (POLR2F, CSF2RA, CD86, MMP2) have been targeted for drug development on autoimmune diseases and other cancers, with the potentials of being repurposed as therapeutic targets for CRC. This study identified several protein biomarkers to be associated with CRC risk and provided new insights into the etiology and promising targets for the development of screening biomarkers and therapeutic drugs for CRC.",Genome medicine,2023,Humans; Proteome; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Genome-Wide Association Study; Biomarkers; Colorectal Neoplasms; Calcium-Binding Proteins; Membrane Proteins; Extracellular Matrix Proteins,False,8
FinnGen,38103512,Multi-omic insight into the molecular networks of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the genetic pathophysiology was not fully elucidated. We employed Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses to investigate the associations between mitochondrial-related genes and IBD via integrating multi-omics. Summary-level data of mitochondrial gene methylation, expression and protein abundance levels were obtained from corresponding methylation, expression and protein quantitative trait loci studies, respectively. We obtained genetic associations with IBD and its two subtypes from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (discovery), the UK Biobank (replication), and the FinnGen study (replication). We performed summary-data-based Mendelian randomization analysis to assess the associations of mitochondrial gene-related molecular features with IBD. Colocalization analysis was further conducted to assess whether the identified signal pairs shared a causal genetic variant. After integrating the multi-omics data between mQTL-eQTL and eQTL-pQTL, we identified two mitochondrial genes, i.e., PARK7 and ACADM, with tier 1 evidence for their associations with IBD and ulcerative colitis (UC). PDK1 and FISI genes were associated with UC risk with tier 2 and tier 3 evidence, respectively. The methylation of cg05467918 in ACADM was associated with lower expression of ACADM, which fits with the positive effect of cg05467918 methylation on UC risk. Consistently, the inverse associations between gene methylation and gene expression were also observed in PARK7 (cg10385390) and PDK1 (cg17679246), which were corroborated with the protective role in UC. At circulating protein level, genetically predicted higher levels of PARK7 (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25-0.52) and HINT1 (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.74) were inversely associated with IBD risk; genetically predicted higher level of HINT1 was associated with a decreased risk of Crohn's disease (CD) (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14-0.49) and a higher level of ACADM (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.55-0.83), PDK1 (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.81), FIS1 (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47-0.83) was associated with a decreased risk of UC. We found that the mitochondrial PARK7 gene was putatively associated with IBD risk, and mitochondrial FIS1, PDK1, and ACADM genes were associated with UC risk with evidence from multi-omics levels. This study identified mitochondrial genes in relation to IBD, which may enhance the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of IBD development.

To disentangle the underlying genetic architecture of preeclampsia and preeclampsia or other maternal hypertension during pregnancy with a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This GWAS included meta-analyses in maternal preeclampsia and a combination phenotype encompassing maternal preeclampsia and preeclampsia or other maternal hypertensive disorders. Two overlapping phenotype groups were selected for examination, namely, preeclampsia and preeclampsia or other maternal hypertension during pregnancy. Data from the Finnish Genetics of Pre-eclampsia Consortium (FINNPEC, 1990-2011), Finnish FinnGen project (1964-2019), Estonian Biobank (1997-2019), and the previously published InterPregGen consortium GWAS were combined. Individuals with preeclampsia or other maternal hypertension during pregnancy and control individuals were selected from the cohorts based on relevant International Classification of Diseases codes. Data were analyzed from July 2020 to February 2023. The association of a genome-wide set of genetic variants and clinical risk factors was analyzed for the 2 phenotypes. A total of 16 743 women with prior preeclampsia and 15 200 with preeclampsia or other maternal hypertension during pregnancy were obtained from FINNPEC, FinnGen, Estonian Biobank, and the InterPregGen consortium study (respective mean [SD] ages at diagnosis: 30.3 [5.5], 28.7 [5.6], 29.7 [7.0], and 28 [not available] years). The analysis found 19 genome-wide significant associations, 13 of which were novel. Seven of the novel loci harbor genes previously associated with blood pressure traits (NPPA, NPR3, PLCE1, TNS2, FURIN, RGL3, and PREX1). In line with this, the 2 study phenotypes showed genetic correlation with blood pressure traits. In addition, novel risk loci were identified in the proximity of genes involved in the development of placenta (PGR, TRPC6, ACTN4, and PZP), remodeling of uterine spiral arteries (NPPA, NPPB, NPR3, and ACTN4), kidney function (PLCE1, TNS2, ACTN4, and TRPC6), and maintenance of proteostasis in pregnancy serum (PZP). The findings indicate that genes related to blood pressure traits are associated with preeclampsia, but many of these genes have additional pleiotropic effects on cardiometabolic, endothelial, and placental function. Furthermore, several of the associated loci have no known connection with cardiovascular disease but instead harbor genes contributing to maintenance of successful pregnancy, with dysfunctions leading to preeclampsialike symptoms.",JAMA cardiology,2023,"Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Pre-Eclampsia; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Genome-Wide Association Study; TRPC6 Cation Channel; Placenta; Risk Factors",False,3

Summary-level data of 4907 circulating protein levels were extracted from a large-scale protein quantitative trait loci study including 35,559 individuals. Genetic associations with IBD and its subtypes were obtained from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (25,024 cases and 34,915 controls), the FinnGen study (7206 cases and 253,199 controls), and the UK Biobank study (7045 cases and 449,282 controls). MR analysis was conducted to estimate the associations between protein and IBD risk. The colocalization analysis was used to examine whether the identified proteins and IBD shared casual variants. Genetically predicted levels of 3, and 5 circulating proteins were associated with IBD and ulcerative colitis (UC), respectively. With high supporting evidence of colocalization, genetically predicted MST1 (macrophage stimulating 1) and HGFAC (hepatocyte growth factor activator) levels were inversely associated with IBD risks. The associations of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), MST1, CXCL5 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5), and ITPKA (inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase A) with the risk of UC were supported by colocalization analysis. The proteome-wide MR investigation identified many proteins associated with the risk of IBD.

Genetic predisposition to smoking initiation was associated with increased risk of 20 of 24 gastrointestinal diseases, including 7 upper gastrointestinal diseases (gastroesophageal reflux, esophageal cancer, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, acute gastritis, chronic gastritis, and gastric cancer), 4 lower gastrointestinal diseases (irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis), 8 hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis, liver cancer, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and acute and chronic pancreatitis), and acute appendicitis. Fifteen out of 20 associations persisted after adjusting for genetically predicted alcohol consumption. Genetically predicted higher alcohol consumption was associated with increased risk of duodenal ulcer, alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis, and chronic pancreatitis; however, the association for duodenal ulcer did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for genetic predisposition to smoking initiation. This study provides MR evidence supporting causal associations of smoking with a broad range of gastrointestinal diseases, whereas alcohol consumption was associated with only a few gastrointestinal diseases.

People who smoke cigarettes or drink large amounts of alcohol are more likely to develop disorders with their digestive system. But it is difficult to prove that heavy drinking or smoking is the primary cause of these gastrointestinal diseases. For example, it is possible that having a digestive disorder makes people more likely to take up these habits to reduce pain or discomfort caused by the illness (an effect known as reverse causation). The association may also be the result of confounding factors, such as age or diet, which contribute to digestive problems as well as the health outcomes of smoking and drinking. Additionally, many people who smoke also drink alcohol and vice versa, making it challenging to determine if one or both behaviors contribute to the disease. One solution is to employ Mendelian randomization which uses genetics to determine if two variables are linked. Using this statistical approach, Yuan, Chen, Ruan et al. investigated if people who display genetic variants that predispose someone to becoming a smoker or drinker are at greater risk of developing certain digestive disorders. This reduces the possibility of confounding and reverse causation, as any association between genetic variants will have been present since birth, and will have not been impacted by external factors. Yuan, Chen, Ruan et al. used data from two studies that had collected the genetic and health information of thousands of people living in the United Kingdom or Finland. The analyses revealed that genetic variants associated with cigarette smoking increase the risk of 20 of the 24 gastrointestinal diseases investigated. This risk persisted for most of the disorders, even after adjusting for genes linked with alcohol consumption. Further analysis showed that genetic variants linked to heavy drinking increase the risk of duodenal ulcer, alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis, and chronic pancreatitis. However, accounting for smoking-linked genes eliminated the relationship with duodenal ulcer. These findings suggest that smoking has detrimental effects on gastrointestinal health. Reducing the number of people who start smoking or encouraging smokers to quit may help prevent digestive diseases. Even though there were fewer associations between heavy alcohol consumption and gastrointestinal illness, further studies are needed to investigate this relationship in more depth.",eLife,2023,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Duodenal Ulcer; Smoking; Alcohol Drinking; Esophageal Neoplasms; Liver Diseases, Alcoholic; Gastritis; Pancreatitis, Chronic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,2
FinnGen,36652249,"Epidemiologic and Genetic Associations of Endometriosis With Depression, Anxiety, and Eating Disorders.","Endometriosis is a common chronic gynecologic pathology with a large negative impact on women's health. Beyond severe physical symptoms, endometriosis is also associated with several psychiatric comorbidities, including depression and anxiety. To investigate whether pleiotropy contributes to the association of endometriosis with depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. This genetic association study was performed between September 13, 2021, and June 24, 2022, in 202 276 unrelated female participants. Genotypic and phenotypic information from the UK Biobank was combined with genome-wide association statistics available from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (11 countries), the Million Veteran Program (US), the FinnGen study (Finland), and the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) consortium (5 countries). The main outcomes were the phenotypic and genetic associations of endometriosis with anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. A total of 8276 women with endometriosis (mean [SD] age, 53.1 [7.9] years) and 194 000 female controls (mean [SD] age, 56.7 [7.9] years) were included in the study. In a multivariate regression analysis accounting for age, body mass index, socioeconomic status, chronic pain-related phenotypes, irritable bowel syndrome, and psychiatric comorbidities, endometriosis was associated with increased odds of depression (odds ratio [OR], 3.61; 95% CI, 3.32-3.92), eating disorders (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.96-4.41), and anxiety (OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 2.30-2.97). These associations were supported by consistent genetic correlations (rg) (depression rg, 0.36, P = 1.5 × 10-9; anxiety rg, 0.33, P = 1.17 × 10-5; and eating disorders rg, 0.61, P = .02). With the application of a 1-sample mendelian randomization, the genetic liabilities to depression and anxiety were associated with increased odds of endometriosis (depression: OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.08-1.11; anxiety: OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.13-1.65). A genome-wide analysis of pleiotropic associations shared between endometriosis and psychiatric disorders identified 1 locus, DGKB rs12666606, with evidence of pleiotropy between endometriosis and depression after multiple testing correction (z = -9.46 for endometriosis, z = 8.10 for depression, P = 5.56 × 10-8; false discovery rate q = 4.95 × 10-4). These findings highlight that endometriosis is associated with women's mental health through pleiotropic mechanisms. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to provide genetic and phenotypic evidence of the processes underlying the psychiatric comorbidities of endometriosis.",JAMA network open,2023,Humans; Female; Endometriosis; Depression; Genome-Wide Association Study; Anxiety; Feeding and Eating Disorders,False,8
FinnGen,37659996,Causal associations between type 1 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases: a Mendelian randomization study.,"The presence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has been demonstrated to pose an increased risk for developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, the causal relationships between T1DM and CVDs remain unclear due to the uncontrolled confounding factors and reverse causation bias of the observational studies. Summary statistics of T1DM and seven CVDs from the largest available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of European ancestry and FinnGen biobank were extracted for the primary MR analysis, and the analysis was replicated using UK biobank (UKBB) for validation. Three complementary methods: inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger were used for the MR estimates. The potential pleiotropic effects were assessed by MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO global test. Additionally, multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was performed to examine whether T1DM has independent effects on CVDs with adjustment of potential confounding factors. Moreover, a two-step MR approach was used to assess the potential mediating effects of these factors on the causal effects between T1DM and CVDs. Causal effects of T1DM on peripheral atherosclerosis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.10; p = 0.002)] and coronary atherosclerosis (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05; p = 0.001) were found. The results were less likely to be biased by the horizontal pleiotropic effects (both p values of MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO Global test > 0.05). In the following MVMR analysis, we found the causal effects of T1DM on peripheral atherosclerosis and coronary atherosclerosis remain significant after adjusting for a series of potential confounding factors. Moreover, we found that hypertension partly mediated the causal effects of T1DM on peripheral atherosclerosis (proportion of mediation effect in total effect: 11.47%, 95% CI: 3.23-19.71%) and coronary atherosclerosis (16.84%, 95% CI: 5.35-28.33%). We didn't find significant causal relationships between T1DM and other CVDs, including heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. For the reverse MR from CVD to T1DM, no significant causal relationships were identified.

FinnGen,38053214,Association of autoimmune diseases with the occurrence and 28-day mortality of sepsis: an observational and Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies have indicated a potential association between autoimmune diseases and the occurrence of sepsis, with an increased risk of mortality among affected patients. However, whether a causal relationship exists between the two remains unknown. In the Mendelian randomization (MR) study, we accessed exposure Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from both the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (MRC-IEU) and the FinnGen consortium. GWAS data for sepsis and its 28-day mortality were obtained from MRC-IEU. We employed univariable, multivariable, and reverse MR analyses to explore potential associations between autoimmune disorders and sepsis and its 28-day mortality. Additionally, a two-step mediation MR analysis was performed to investigate indirect factors possibly influencing the relationship between autoimmune disorders and sepsis. Afterward, we conducted an observational analysis to further explore the relationship between autoimmune disease and occurrence as well as 28-day mortality of sepsis using a real-world database (the MIMIC-IV database). A cohort of 2537 patients diagnosed with autoimmune disease were extracted from the database for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to confirm the association between autoimmune diseases and the occurrence of sepsis, as well as the 28-day mortality associated with sepsis. In univariable MR analysis, there appeared to be causal relationships between genetically predicted type 1 diabetes (OR = 1.036, 95% CI = 1.023-1.048, p = 9.130E-09), rheumatoid arthritis (OR = 1.077, 95% CI = 1.058-1.097, p = 1.00E-15) and sepsis, while a potential causal link was observed between celiac disease and sepsis (OR = 1.013, 95% CI = 1.002-1.024, p = 0.026). In a subsequent multivariable MR analysis, only rheumatoid arthritis was found to be independently associated with the risk of sepsis (OR = 1.138, 95% CI = 1.044-1.240, p = 3.36E-03). Furthermore, there was no causal link between autoimmune disorders and 28-day mortality from sepsis. In reverse MR analysis, sepsis was suggested to potentially trigger the onset of psoriasis (OR = 1.084, 95% CI = 1.040-1.131, p = 1.488E-04). In the real-world observational study, adjusting for multiple confounders, rheumatoid arthritis (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.11-1.64, p = 0.003) and multiple sclerosis (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.03-1.68, p = 0.02) were associated with a higher risk of sepsis. In addition, we did not find that autoimmune diseases were associated with 28-day mortality from sepsis. Both in observational and MR analysis, only rheumatoid arthritis is highly correlated with occurrence of sepsis. However, autoimmune disease was not associated with an increased 28-day mortality in patient with sepsis. Sepsis may increase the risk of developing psoriasis.","Critical care (London, England)",2023,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Autoimmune Diseases; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Sepsis; Psoriasis",False,4
FinnGen,37494057,Genetic Variants Associated With Hidradenitis Suppurativa.,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a common and severely morbid chronic inflammatory skin disease that is reported to be highly heritable. However, the genetic understanding of HS is insufficient, and limited genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been performed for HS, which have not identified significant risk loci. To identify genetic variants associated with HS and to shed light on the underlying genes and genetic mechanisms. This genetic association study recruited 753 patients with HS in the HS Program for Research and Care Excellence (HS ProCARE) at the University of North Carolina Department of Dermatology from August 2018 to July 2021. A GWAS was performed for 720 patients (after quality control) with controls from the Add Health study and then meta-analyzed with 2 large biobanks, UK Biobank (247 cases) and FinnGen (673 cases). Variants at 3 loci were tested for replication in the BioVU biobank (290 cases). Data analysis was performed from September 2021 to December 2022. Main outcome measures are loci identified, with association of P < 1 × 10-8 considered significant. A total of 753 patients were recruited, with 720 included in the analysis. Mean (SD) age at symptom onset was 20.3 (10.57) years and at enrollment was 35.3 (13.52) years; 360 (50.0%) patients were Black, and 575 (79.7%) were female. In a meta-analysis of the 4 studies, 2 HS-associated loci were identified and replicated, with lead variants rs10512572 (P = 2.3 × 10-11) and rs17090189 (P = 2.1 × 10-8) near the SOX9 and KLF5 genes, respectively. Variants at these loci are located in enhancer regulatory elements detected in skin tissue. In this genetic association study, common variants associated with HS located near the SOX9 and KLF5 genes were associated with risk of HS. These or other nearby genes may be associated with genetic risk of disease and the development of clinical features, such as cysts, comedones, and inflammatory tunnels, that are unique to HS.

Using summary statistics of genome-wide association studies of predominantly European ancestry, we conducted 2-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization to estimate the independent effects of education, intelligence, or cognition on hypertension (FinnGen study, 70 651 cases/223 663 controls; UK Biobank, 77 723 cases/330 366 controls) and blood pressure (International Consortium of Blood Pressure, 757 601 participants), and used 2-step Mendelian randomization to evaluate 25 potential mediators of the association and calculate the mediated proportions. Meta-analysis of inverse variance weighted Mendelian randomization results from FinnGen and UK Biobank showed that genetically predicted 1-SD (4.2 years) higher education was associated with 44% (95% CI: 0.40-0.79) decreased hypertension risk and 1.682 mm Hg lower systolic and 0.898 mm Hg lower diastolic blood pressure, independently of intelligence and cognition. While the causal effects of intelligence and cognition on hypertension were not independent of education; 6 out of 25 cardiometabolic risk factors were identified as mediators of the association between education and hypertension, ranked by mediated proportions, including body mass index (mediated proportion: 30.1%), waist-to-hip ratio (22.8%), body fat percentage (14.1%), major depression (7.0%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (4.7%), and triglycerides (3.4%). These results were robust to sensitivity analyses. Our findings illustrated the causal, independent impact of education on hypertension and blood pressure and outlined cardiometabolic mediators as priority targets for prevention of hypertension attributable to low education.","Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",2023,Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Hypertension,False,7

FinnGen,37226166,The effects of coagulation factors on the risk of endometriosis: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Endometriosis is recognized as a complex gynecological disorder that can cause severe pain and infertility, affecting 6-10% of all reproductive-aged women. Endometriosis is a condition in which endometrial tissue, which normally lines the inside of the uterus, deposits in other tissues. The etiology and pathogenesis of endometriosis remain ambiguous. Despite debates, it is generally agreed that endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, and patients with endometriosis appear to be in a hypercoagulable state. The coagulation system plays important roles in hemostasis and inflammatory responses. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to use publicly available GWAS summary statistics to examine the causal relationship between coagulation factors and the risk of endometriosis. To investigate the causal relationship between coagulation factors and the risk of endometriosis, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analytic framework was used. A series of quality control procedures were followed in order to select eligible instrumental variables that were strongly associated with the exposures (vWF, ADAMTS13, aPTT, FVIII, FXI, FVII, FX, ETP, PAI-1, protein C, and plasmin). Two independent cohorts of European ancestry with endometriosis GWAS summary statistics were used: UK Biobank (4354 cases and 217,500 controls) and FinnGen (8288 cases and 68,969 controls). We conducted MR analyses separately in the UK Biobank and FinnGen, followed by a meta-analysis. The Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, and leave-one-out sensitivity analyses were used to assess the heterogeneities, horizontal pleiotropy, and stabilities of SNPs in endometriosis. Our two-sample MR analysis of 11 coagulation factors in the UK Biobank suggested a reliable causal effect of genetically predicted plasma ADAMTS13 level on decreased endometriosis risk. A negative causal effect of ADAMTS13 and a positive causal effect of vWF on endometriosis were observed in the FinnGen. In the meta-analysis, the causal associations remained significant with a strong effect size. The MR analyses also identified potential causal effects of ADAMTS13 and vWF on different sub-phenotypes of endometrioses. Our MR analysis based on GWAS data from large-scale population studies demonstrated the causal associations between ADAMTS13/vWF and the risk of endometriosis. These findings suggest that these coagulation factors are involved in the development of endometriosis and may represent potential therapeutic targets for the management of this complex disease.",BMC medicine,2023,Female; Humans; Endometriosis; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; von Willebrand Factor; Blood Coagulation Factors; Blood Coagulation,False,8

However, large population-level studies are scarce, and causal interpretation of results from traditional observational designs is limited by confounding. To investigate the causal association between genetically proxied lipid-lowering drugs and psoriasis risk. This 2-sample mendelian randomization study was performed from August to October 2022 and included population-level genome-wide association studies of psoriasis in the UK Biobank and FinnGen studies and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium. The inverse variance-weighted method was used with pleiotropy robust methods and colocalization as sensitivity analyses. Genetically proxied inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR, targeted by statins), Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1, targeted by ezetimibe), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9, targeted by, eg, alirocumab), using LDL as the biomarker. Risk of psoriasis. Data from 12 116 patients with psoriasis and approximately 1.3 million individuals with LDL measurement were analyzed.

Sensitivity analyses did not provide statistical evidence of bias from pleiotropy or genetic confounding. No robust association was found for HMGCR or NPC1L1 inhibition. This mendelian randomization study suggests that PCSK9 is implicated in psoriasis pathogenesis, and its inhibition is associated with reduced psoriasis risk.

We aimed to identify the causally estimated effects of micronutrients on cancer by applying the Mendelian randomization (MR) method, using single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with micronutrient levels as instrumental variables. We obtained instrumental variables of 14 genetically predicted micronutrient levels and applied two-sample MR to estimate their causal effects on 22 cancer outcomes from a meta-analysis of the UK Biobank (UKB) and FinnGen cohorts (overall cancer and 21 site-specific cancers, including breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer), in addition to six major cancer outcomes and 20 cancer subset outcomes from cancer consortia.

By combining data from observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies, we aimed to investigate whether GLP-1 RAs decrease the risk of DR. We combined data from several Swedish Registers and identified patients with incident type 2 diabetes being treated with GLP-1 RAs between 2006 and 2015, and matched them to diabetic patients who did not use GLP-1 RAs as the comparisons. The Cox proportional hazards models were applied to assess the risk of DR. We further performed the summary-data-based MR (SMR) analyses based on the Genotype-Tissue Expression databases and the Genome-Wide Association Study of DR from the FinnGen consortium. A total of 2390 diabetic patients were treated with GLP-1 RAs and the incidence of DR was 5.97 per 1000 person-years.

FinnGen,37563724,Identification of host gene-microbiome associations in colorectal cancer patients using mendelian randomization.,"There are many studies indicating that alterations in the abundance of certain gut microbiota are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, a causal relationship has not been identified due to confounding factors such as lifestyle, environmental, and possible reverse causal associations between the two. Furthermore, certain host gene mutations can also contribute to the development of CRC. However, the association between genes and gut microbes in patients with CRC has not been extensively studied. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to reveal the causal relationship between gut microbiota and CRC. We obtained SNPs associated with gut microbiome abundance as instrumental variables (IVs) from a large-scale, multi-ethnic GWAS study, and extracted CRC-related datasets from an East Asian Population genetic consortia GWAS (AGWAS) study and FinnGen consortium, respectively. We analyzed a total of 166 bacterial features at four taxonomic levels, including order, family, genus, and species. The inverse-variance-weighted (IVW), weighted median, MR-Egger, and simple median methods were applied to the MR analysis, and the robustness of the results were tested using a series of sensitivity analyses. We extracted IVs of gut microbiota with direct causal association with CRC for SNP annotation to identify the genes in which these genetic variants were located to reveal the possible host gene-microbiome associations in CRC patients.

FinnGen,36800181,Association of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy With Future Cardiovascular Disease.,"The findings of this study provide genetic evidence supporting an association between HDPs and higher risk of coronary artery disease and stroke, which is only partially mediated by cardiometabolic factors. This supports classification of HDPs as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. A genome-wide genetic association study using mendelian randomization (MR) was performed from February 16 to March 4, 2022. Primary analysis was conducted using inverse-variance-weighted MR. Mediation analyses were performed using a multivariable MR framework. All studies included patients predominantly of European ancestry. Female-specific summary-level data from FinnGen (sixth release). Uncorrelated (r2<0.001) single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were selected as instrumental variants from the FinnGen consortium summary statistics for exposures of any HDP, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia or eclampsia. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDPs) are major causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and are observationally associated with future maternal risk of cardiovascular disease. However, observational results may be subject to residual confounding and bias. Genetic association estimates for outcomes were extracted from genome-wide association studies of 122 733 cases for coronary artery disease, 34 217 cases for ischemic stroke, 47 309 cases for heart failure, and 60 620 cases for atrial fibrillation. To investigate the association of HDPs with multiple cardiovascular diseases. Genetically predicted HDPs were associated with a higher risk of coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR], 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.43; P = .002); this association was evident for both gestational hypertension (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.17; P = .04) and preeclampsia/eclampsia (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P = .03). Genetically predicted HDPs were also associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.12-1.44; P = 2.87 × 10-4). Mediation analysis revealed a partial attenuation of the effect of HDPs on coronary artery disease after adjustment for systolic blood pressure (total effect OR, 1.24; direct effect OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08; P = .02) and type 2 diabetes (total effect OR, 1.24; direct effect OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04-1.29; P = .008). No associations were noted between genetically predicted HDPs and heart failure (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.76-1.23; P = .79) or atrial fibrillation (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.65-1.88; P = .71).",JAMA network open,2023,"Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Atrial Fibrillation; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronary Artery Disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Eclampsia; Genome-Wide Association Study; Heart Failure; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Ischemic Stroke; Pre-Eclampsia; Mendelian Randomization Analysis",False,3

The loss-of-function missense variant rs34536443 in TYK2 gene was used as a genetic instrument to proxy the effect of TYK2 inhibition. A phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted to explore the associations of genetically-proxied TYK2 inhibition with 1473 disease outcomes in UK Biobank (N = 339,197). Identified associations were examined for replication in FinnGen (N = 260,405). We further performed tissue-specific gene expression MR, colocalization analyses, and MR with 247 blood biomarkers. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on TYK2 inhibitor was performed to complement the genetic evidence. PheWAS-MR found that genetically-proxied TYK2 inhibition was associated with lower risk of a wide range of autoimmune diseases. The associations with hypothyroidism and psoriasis were confirmed in MR analysis of tissue-specific TYK2 gene expression and the associations with systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis were observed in colocalization analysis. There were nominal associations of genetically-proxied TYK2 inhibition with increased risk of prostate and breast cancer but not in tissue-specific expression MR or colocalization analyses. Thirty-seven blood biomarkers were associated with the TYK2 loss-of-function mutation. Evidence from RCTs confirmed the effectiveness of TYK2 inhibitors on plaque psoriasis and reported several adverse effects. This study supports TYK2 inhibitor as a potential treatment for psoriasis and several other autoimmune diseases. Increased pharmacovigilance is warranted in relation to the potential adverse effects.

FinnGen,37711902,Obesity and risk for respiratory diseases: a Mendelian randomization study.,"No existing comprehensive Mendelian randomization studies have focused on how obesity affects respiratory diseases. BMI and waist circumference, mainly from the UK Biobank, and 35 respiratory diseases from the FinnGen Biobank were subjected to Mendelian randomization analyses. In this study, the inverse variance weighting method was used as the predominant analysis method and was complemented by MR-Egger and weighted median methods. Horizontal pleiotropy and potential outliers were detected by employing the MR-PRESSO method. This study indicated that obesity rises the possibility of acute upper respiratory infections (BMI: OR=1.131, p<0.0001; WC: OR=1.097, p=0.00406), acute sinusitis (BMI: OR=1.161, p=0.000262; WC: OR=1.209, p=0.000263), acute pharyngitis (WC: OR=1.238, p=0.0258), acute laryngitis and tracheitis (BMI: OR=1.202, p=0.0288; WC: OR=1.381, p=0.00192), all influenza (BMI: OR=1.243, p=0.000235; WC: OR=1.206, p=0.0119), viral pneumonia (WC: OR=1.446, p=0.000870), all pneumoniae (BMI: OR=1.174, p <0.0001; WC: OR=1.272, p <0.0001), bacterial pneumoniae (BMI: OR=1.183, p=0.000290; WC: OR=1.274, p<0.0001), acute bronchitis (BMI: OR=1.252, p <0.0001; WC: OR=1.237, p=0.000268), acute unspecified lower respiratory infection (BMI: OR=1.303, p=0.000403), chronic tonsils and adenoids diseases (BMI: OR=1.236, p <0.0001; WC: OR=1.178, p=0.000157), chronic laryngotracheitis and laryngitis (WC: OR=1.300, p=0.00785), COPD (BMI: OR=1.429, p <0.0001; WC: OR=1.591, p <0.0001), asthma (BMI: OR=1.358, p <0.0001; WC: OR=1.515, p <0.0001), necrotic and suppurative conditions of lower respiratory tract (WC: OR=1.405, p=0.0427), pleural effusion (BMI: OR=1.277, p=0.00225; WC: OR=1.561, p<0.0001), pleural plaque (BMI: OR=1.245, p=0.0312), other diseases of the respiratory system (BMI: OR=1.448, p <0.0001; WC: OR=1.590, p <0.0001), and non-small cell lung cancer (BMI: OR=1.262, p=0.00576; WC: OR=1.398, p=0.00181). This study also indicated that obesity decreases the possibility of bronchiectasis (BMI: OR=0.705; p=0.00200).

FinnGen,36845092,Systemic inflammatory regulators and proliferative diabetic retinopathy: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"Increasing evidence shows that systemic inflammation is an embedded mechanism of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). However, the specific systemic inflammatory factors involved in this process remained obscure. The study aimed to identify the upstream and downstream systemic regulators of PDR by using Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. We performed a bidirectional two-sample MR analysis implementing the results from genome-wide association studies for 41 serum cytokines from 8,293 Finnish individuals, and PDR from FinnGen consortium (2,025 cases vs. 284,826 controls) and eight cohorts of European ancestry (398 cases vs. 2,848 controls), respectively. The inverse-variance-weighted method was adopted as the main MR method, and four additional MR methods (MR-Egger, weighted-median, MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO), and MR-Steiger filtering methods) were used for the sensitivity analyses. Results from FinnGen and eight cohorts were pooled into a meta-analysis. Our results showed that genetically predicted higher stem cell growth factor-β (SCGFb) and interleukin-8 were positively associated with an elevated risk of PDR, with a combined effect of one standard deviation (SD) increase in SCGFb and interleukin-8 causing 11.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.6%, 24.2%]) and 21.4% [95% CI: 3.8%, 41.9%]) higher risk of PDR, respectively. In contrast, genetically predisposition to PDR showed a positive association with the increased levels of growth-regulated oncogene-α (GROa), stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF1a), monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP3), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), interleukin-12p70, and interleukin-2 receptor subunit alpha (IL-2ra). Our MR study identified two upstream regulators and six downstream effectors of PDR, providing opportunities for new therapeutic exploitation of PDR onset.

FinnGen,37678759,Serum albumin and risk of incident diabetes and diabetic microvascular complications in the UK Biobank cohort.,"To examine the associations between serum albumin and the incidences of diabetes and diabetic microvascular complications in participants of the UK Biobank cohort. There were 398,146 participants without diabetes and 30,952 patients with diabetes from the UK Biobank cohort included in this study. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze the association of albumin with the incidences of diabetes and diabetic microvascular complications. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to determine the genetic relationships between serum albumin and diabetes. After a median 12.90 years follow-up, 14,710 participants developed incident diabetes (58.83 ± 7.52 years, 56.10% male). After multivariate adjustment, serum albumin was inversely associated with incident diabetes: hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval] per 10 g/l increase 0.88 [0.82;0.94]. MR analyses suggested a potential genetic influence of serum albumin on diabetes in both the UK Biobank and the FinnGen consortium: odds ratios (ORs) [95% confidence interval per 1 g/l increase 0.99 [0.98;1.00] and 0.78 [0.67;0.92], respectively. In patients with diabetes, higher serum albumin levels were significantly associated with lower risk for diabetic microvascular complications. Specifically, per 10 g/l increase in serum albumin, the HRs for diabetic nephropathy, ophthalmopathy, and neuropathy were 0.42 [0.30;0.58], 0.61 [0.52;0.72], and 0.67 [0.51;0.88], respectively. In this large prospective study, serum levels of albumin were inversely associated with the incidences of diabetes and diabetic microvascular complications.

FinnGen,37787550,Central Adiposity Increases Risk of Kidney Stone Disease through Effects on Serum Calcium Concentrations.,"Kidney stone disease is a common disorder with poorly understood pathophysiology. Observational and genetic studies indicate that adiposity is associated with an increased risk of kidney stone disease. However, the relative contribution of general and central adipose depots and the mechanisms by which effects of adiposity on kidney stone disease are mediated have not been defined. Using conventional and genetic epidemiological techniques, we demonstrate that general and central adiposity are independently associated with kidney stone disease. In addition, one mechanism by which central adiposity increases risk of kidney stone disease is by increasing serum calcium concentration. Therapies targeting adipose depots may affect calcium homeostasis and help to prevent kidney stone disease. Kidney stone disease affects approximately 10% of individuals in their lifetime and is frequently recurrent. The disease is linked to obesity, but the mechanisms mediating this association are uncertain. Associations of adiposity and incident kidney stone disease were assessed in the UK Biobank over a mean of 11.6 years/person. Genome-wide association studies and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were undertaken in the UK Biobank, FinnGen, and in meta-analyzed cohorts to identify factors that affect kidney stone disease risk. Observational analyses on UK Biobank data demonstrated that increasing central and general adiposity is independently associated with incident kidney stone formation. Multivariable MR, using meta-analyzed UK Biobank and FinnGen data, established that risk of kidney stone disease increases by approximately 21% per one standard deviation increase in body mass index (BMI, a marker of general adiposity) independent of waist-to-hip ratio (WHR, a marker of central adiposity) and approximately 24% per one standard deviation increase of WHR independent of BMI. Genetic analyses indicate that higher WHR, but not higher BMI, increases risk of kidney stone disease by elevating adjusted serum calcium concentrations (β=0.12 mmol/L); WHR mediates 12%-15% of its effect on kidney stone risk in this way. Our study indicates that visceral adipose depots elevate serum calcium concentrations, resulting in increased risk of kidney stone disease. These findings highlight the importance of weight loss in individuals with recurrent kidney stones and suggest that therapies targeting adipose depots may affect calcium homeostasis and contribute to prevention of kidney stone disease.",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,2023,"Humans; Adiposity; Calcium; Risk Factors; Genome-Wide Association Study; Obesity; Obesity, Abdominal; Waist-Hip Ratio; Body Mass Index; Kidney Calculi; Mendelian Randomization Analysis",False,8

We leveraged publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data to perform MR analysis. The gut microbiota-related GWAS data from 18,340 individuals from the international consortium MiBioGen were used. The summary statistic data for T1D (n = 264,137) were obtained from the latest release from the FinnGen consortium as the outcome of interest. The selection of instrumental variables conformed strictly to a series of preset inclusion and exclusion criteria. MR-Egger, weighted median, inverse variance weighted (IVW), and weighted mode methods were used to assess the causal association.

At the phylum level, only Bacteroidetes was indicated to have causality on T1D (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.01-1.53,  The present study reports that Bacteroidetes phylum, Bacteroidia class, and Bacteroidales order causally increase T1D risk, whereas ",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,"Eubacterium; Bacteroidetes; Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Genome-Wide Association Study",False,6
FinnGen,37344162,Causal relationship between gastro-esophageal reflux disease and risk of lung cancer: insights from multivariable Mendelian randomization and mediation analysis.,"A recent study has reported that anti-reflux surgery reduced the risk of lung cancer. However, the exact causal association between gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GORD) and lung cancer remains obscure. Therefore, we conducted a multivariable and network Mendelian randomization (MR) study to explore this potential association and mediation effect. Independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly associated with GORD were selected as instrumental variables (IVs) from the corresponding genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The summary statistics were obtained from the largest GORD GWAS meta-analysis of 367 441 (78 707 cases) European individuals, and the summary statistics of lung cancer and pathological subtypes came from International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) and FinnGen databases. Univariable and multivariable MR analyses were performed to investigate and verify the causal relationship between genetically predicted GORD and lung cancer. Network MR analysis was conducted to reveal the mediating role of GORD between smoking initiation and lung cancer. The univariable MR analysis demonstrated that GORD was associated with an increased risk of total lung cancer in both ILCCO [inverse variance weighted (IVW): odds ratio (OR) = 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.62, P = 1.70E-04] and FinnGen database (IVW: OR = 1.25, 95% confidence interval CI 1.03-1.52, P = 2.27E-02). The consistent results were observed after adjusting the potential confounders [smoking traits, body mass index (BMI) and type 2 diabetes] in multivariable MR analyses. In subtype analyses, GORD was associated with lung adenocarcinoma (IVW: OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.59, P = 3.48E-02) and lung squamous cell carcinomas (IVW: OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.22-1.86, P = 1.52E-04). Moreover, GORD mediated 32.43% (95% CI 14.18-49.82%) and 25.00% (95% CI 3.13-50.00%) of the smoking initiation effects on lung cancer risk in the ILCCO and FinnGen databases, respectively. This study provides credible evidence that genetically predicted GORD was significantly associated with an increased risk of total lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinomas.

To date, most IBD genetic associations were derived from individuals of European (EUR) ancestries. Here we report the largest IBD study of individuals of East Asian (EAS) ancestries, including 14,393 cases and 15,456 controls. We found 80 IBD loci in EAS alone and 320 when meta-analyzed with ~370,000 EUR individuals (~30,000 cases), among which 81 are new. EAS-enriched coding variants implicate many new IBD genes, including ADAP1 and GIT2. Although IBD genetic effects are generally consistent across ancestries, genetics underlying CD appears more ancestry dependent than UC, driven by allele frequency (NOD2) and effect (TNFSF15).

We conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study to determine the association between S-25(OH)D and NAFLD. Seven and 6 independent genetic variants associated with S-25(OH)D and NAFLD at the genome-wide-significance level, respectively, were selected as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for S-25(OH)D were obtained from the Study of Underlying Genetic Determinants of Vitamin D and Highly Related Traits consortium including 79,366 individuals. Summary-level data for NAFLD were available from a genome-wide association meta-analysis (1483 cases and 17,781 controls), the FinnGen consortium (894 cases and 217,898 controls), and the UK Biobank study (275 cases and 360,919 controls). Summary-level data for 4 liver enzymes were obtained from the UK Biobank. There were genetic correlations of S-25(OH)D with NAFLD and certain liver enzymes. Genetically predicted higher levels of S-25(OH)D were consistently associated with a decreased risk of NAFLD in the 3 sources. For a 1-SD increase in genetically predicted S-25(OH)D levels, the combined odds ratio of NAFLD was 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.89). Genetically predicted higher levels of S-25(OH)D showed a borderline association with aspartate aminotransferase levels (change -1.17; 95% CI, -1.36 to 0.01). Genetic predisposition to NAFLD was not associated with S-25(OH)D (change 0.13; 95% CI, -1.26 to 0.53).

We used the Mendelian randomization (MR) study to explore the potential causal association between OSA with CVDs in the general population. We performed a two-sample MR analysis using five gene-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with OSA at genome-wide significance from the FinnGen study (N = 217 955) and 12 cardiovascular diseases from the UK Biobank and the genetic consortia. The inverse-variance weight was chosen as the primary analysis and was complemented by various sensitivity analyses. The study design applied univariable MR, multivariable MR, and mediation analysis. MR analyses provide evidence of genetically predicted OSA on the risk of heart failure (odds ratio [OR],1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.08 to 1.47), hypertension (OR,1.24; 95%CI, 1.11 to 1.39) and atrial fibrillation (OR,1.21; 95%CI,1.12 to 1.31). Multivariable MR indicated the adverse effect of OSA on heart failure persisted after adjusting BMI, smoking, drinking, and education (IVW OR,1.13; 95%CI, 1.01 to 1.27). However, the significance of hypertension and atrial fibrillation was dampened. Mediation analyses suggest that the causal association between OSA and heart failure is mediated in part by Apolipoprotein B, with a mediated portion of 9%.

FinnGen,37596566,"Lipids, lipid-modifying drug target genes and migraine: a Mendelian randomization study.","Migraine, a prevalent headache disorder with unclear mechanisms and limited treatments, may be influenced by dyslipidemia and genetic factors. Statins and emerging lipid-modifying agents show potential but lack evidence for migraine management. Mendelian Randomization analysis offers insights into causal relationships and therapeutic targets. This study aims to explore genetically predicted lipid traits, drug targets, and their association with migraine risk. We conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses utilizing genetic variants associated with lipid traits and variants in genes encoding the protein targets of various classes of lipid-lowering drugs. The specific drug classes investigated included HMGCR, PCSK9, NPC1L1, ABCG5/ABCG8, LDLR, LPL, ANGPTL3, APOB, CETP, and APOC3. To determine the effects on migraine risk, we meta-analyzed MR estimates for regional variants using data from two large sample sets. The genetic variants were weighted based on their associations with specific lipid traits, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Apolipoprotein A1, and Apolipoprotein B. To obtain association weights, we utilized data from lipid genetics consortia. For lipid-modifying drug targets that exhibited suggestive significance, we further employed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data. Additionally, we performed colocalization analysis to assess genetic confounding. The use of genetic proxies for HMGCR inhibition demonstrated a significant association with a decreased risk of migraine in the FinnGen dataset (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.46-0.88, p = 0.0006) and a nearly significant association in the Choquet dataset (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.60-1.01, p = 0.06). When pooling the estimates, the overall effect size showed a reduced risk of migraine (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60-0.89, p = 0.0016). Similarly, genetic mimicry of LPL enhancement was associated with a lower risk of migraine in the FinnGen dataset (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.69-0.96, p = 0.01) and the Choquet dataset (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83-0.99, p = 0.03). Pooling the estimates showed a consistent effect size (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.83-0.96, p = 0.002). Sensitivity analyses yielded no statistically significant evidence of bias arising from pleiotropy or genetic confounding. In the study, it was observed that among the 10 lipid-lowering drug targets investigated, LPL and HMGCR showed significant associations with migraine risk.

However, the causality have not been confirmed. We aimed to evaluate the causal associations of RC with CMD and the relative risk factors using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) methods. Summary-level statistics of RC, CMD, and cardiometabolic risk factors were obtained from the published data from individuals with a predominantly European ancestry mainly from the UK Biobank and the FinnGen biobank. Univariable and multivariable MR analyses were used to evaluate the causal relationships between RC and CMD. A bidirectional MR analysis was performed to estimate the causality between RC and cardiometabolic risk factors. The main MR method was conducted using the inverse-variance weighted method. Univariable MR analyses showed that genetically predicted RC was causally associated with higher risk of ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation and flutter, peripheral artery disease, and non-rheumatic valve diseases (all P < 0.05). Multivariable MR analyses provided compelling evidence of the harmful effects of RC on the risk of ischemic heart disease (P < 0.05). Bidirectional MR analysis demonstrated that RC was bidirectionally causally linked to total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypercholesterolemia (all P < 0.05). However, no genetic association was found between RC and metabolic disorders or the other cardiometabolic risk factors. This MR study demonstrates that genetically driven RC increases the risk of several CMD and cardiometabolic risk factors, suggesting that targeted RC-lowering therapies may be effective for the primary prevention of CMD.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2023,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Cholesterol; Risk Factors; Atrial Fibrillation; Myocardial Ischemia; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,2

We propose using Mendelian randomization studies to explore shared and distinct risk factors for diabetic lower extremity complications. We selected uncorrelated genetic variants associated with 85 phenotypes in five categories at the genome-wide significance level as instrumental variables. Genetic associations with DFU, diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN), and diabetic peripheral artery disease (DPAD) were obtained from the FinnGen and UK Biobank studies. Body mass index (BMI) emerged as the only significant risk factor for DPAD, DPN, and DFU, independent of type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HbA1c. Educational attainment stood out as the sole significant protective factor against DPAD, DPN, and DFU. Glycemic traits below the type 2 diabetes diagnosis threshold showed associations with DPAD and DPN. While smoking history exhibited suggestive associations with DFU, indicators of poor nutrition, particularly total protein, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular volume, may also signal potential DFU occurrence. Enhanced glycemic control and foot care are essential for the diabetic population with high BMI, limited education, smoking history, and indicators of poor nutrition. By focusing on these specific risk factors, healthcare interventions can be better tailored to prevent and manage DFU effectively.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2023,"Humans; Diabetic Foot; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Risk Factors",False,2
FinnGen,37828993,The causal relationship between gut microbiota and inflammatory dermatoses: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies have shown that gut microbiota is closely associated with inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis, rosacea, and atopic dermatitis (AD). However, the causal relationship between gut microbiota and inflammatory dermatosis remains unclear. Based on Maximum Likelihood (ML), MR-Egger regression, Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO), Weighted Mode, and Weighted Median Estimator (WME) methods, we performed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the causal relationship between gut microbiota and inflammatory dermatosis. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data of gut microbiota came from the MiBioGen consortium, while the GWAS summary data of inflammatory dermatosis (including psoriasis, AD, rosacea, vitiligo, acne, and eczema) came from the FinnGen consortium and IEU Open GWAS project. Cochran's IVW Q test tested the heterogeneity among instrumental variables (IVs). The horizontal pleiotropy was tested by MR-Egger regression intercept analysis and MR-PRESSO analysis. Eventually, the results indicated that 5, 16, 17, 11, 15, and 12 gut microbiota had significant causal effects on psoriasis, rosacea, AD, vitiligo, acne, and eczema, respectively, including 42 protective and 34 risk causal relationships. Especially, Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria at the Family and Genus Level, as common probiotics, were identified as protective factors for the corresponding inflammatory dermatoses. The results of reverse MR analysis suggested a bidirectional causal effect between AD and genus Eubacterium brachy group, vitiligo and genus Ruminococcaceae UCG004. The causal relationship between gut microbiota and psoriasis, rosacea, acne, and eczema is unidirectional. There was no significant heterogeneity among these IVs. In conclusion, this bidirectional two-sample MR study identified 76 causal relationships between the gut microbiome and six inflammatory dermatoses, which may be helpful for the clinical prevention and treatment of inflammatory dermatoses.",Frontiers in immunology,2023,"Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Vitiligo; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Acne Vulgaris; Dermatitis, Atopic; Psoriasis; Rosacea; Eczema",False,6

Meanwhile, relevant studies demonstrated a correlation between GM and IgAN, however, these confounding evidence cannot prove a causal relationship between GM and IgAN. Based on the data from the GM genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MiBioGen and the IgAN GWAS data from the FinnGen research. A bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) study was performed to explore the causal relationship between GM and IgAN. We used inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary method to determine the causal relationship between exposure and outcome in our MR study. Besides, we used additional analysis (MR-Egger, weighted median) and sensitivity analysis (Cochrane's Q test, MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO) to select significant results, followed by Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) to test the results of MR study. Finally, a reverse MR analysis was conducted to estimate the probability of reverse causality. At the locus-wide significance level, the results of IVW method and additional analysis showed that Genus Enterorhabdus was a protective factor for IgAN [OR: 0.456, 95% CI: 0.238-0.875, p=0.023], while Genus butyricicoccus was a risk factor for IgAN [OR: 3.471, 95% CI: 1.671-7.209, p=0.0008]. In the sensitivity analysis, no significant pleiotropy or heterogeneity of the results was found.

FinnGen,37962888,Mendelian Randomization Analysis of Genetic Proxies of Thiazide Diuretics and the Reduction of Kidney Stone Risk.,"Clinical trial data have called into question the efficacy of thiazide diuretics for the prevention of kidney stones. To identify whether there is an association between genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics and the risk of kidney stones. This genetic association study undertook a mendelian randomization analysis of derived exposures and outcomes from genome-wide association study summary statistics. Genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were derived from the International Consortium for Blood Pressure. Kidney stone cases and controls were derived from the Million Veteran Program, UK Biobank, and the FinnGen study. These cross-sectional designs do not report a duration of follow-up. Data analysis was performed in May 2023. Genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were genetic variants in the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter gene associated with systolic blood pressure. Genetic proxies of β-blockers and systolic blood pressure served as negative controls. The main outcome was the odds of kidney stones. The secondary outcomes were serum laboratory values relevant to the treatment of kidney stones. The main analysis included up to 1 079 657 individuals, including 50 832 kidney stone cases and 1 028 825 controls. In a meta-analysis of all cohorts, genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were associated with a lower odds of kidney stones (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.81-0.89; P < .001). Genetic proxies of β-blockers (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.07; P = .52) and systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01; P = .49) were not associated with kidney stones. Genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were associated with higher serum calcium (β [SE], 0.051 [0.0092]; P < .001) and total cholesterol (β [SE], 0.065 [0.015]; P < .001), but lower serum potassium (β [SE], -0.073 [0.022]; P < .001).

Summary-level genome-wide association statistics of CAD were obtained from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (60,801 cases and 123,504 controls) and the FinnGen study (R8, 39,036 cases and 303,463 controls). Proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to identify CAD-associated blood proteins, supplemented by colocalization analysis to minimize potential bias caused by linkage disequilibrium. Two-sample MR analyses were performed to assess the associations of genetically predicted four obesity measures and 13 lifestyle factors with CAD risk and CAD-associated proteins' levels. A two-step network MR analysis was conducted to explore the mediating effects of proteins in the associations between these modifiable factors and CAD. Genetically predicted levels of 41 circulating proteins were associated with CAD, and 17 of them were supported by medium to high colocalization evidence. PTK7 (protein tyrosine kinase-7), RGMB (repulsive guidance molecule BMP co-receptor B), TAGLN2 (transgelin-2), TIMP3 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3), and VIM (vimentin) were identified as promising therapeutic targets. Several proteins were found to mediate the associations between some modifiable factors and CAD, with PCSK9, C1S, AGER (advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor), and MST1 (mammalian Ste20-like kinase 1) exhibiting highest frequency among the mediating networks.

However, the etiology and pathophysiology of IVDD are not yet completely clear. To examine potential causal effects of modifiable risk factors on IVDD. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sample sizes between 54,358 and 766,345 participants. Outcomes included (1) modifiable risk factors associated with IVDD use in the forward MR; and (2) modifiable risk factors that were determined to have a causal association with IVDD in the reverse MR, including smoking, alcohol intake, standing height, education level, household income, sleeplessness, hypertension, hip osteoarthritis, HDL, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A-I, type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose, HbA1c, BMI and obesity trait. We obtained genetic variants associated with 33 exposure factors from genome-wide association studies. Summary statistics for IVDD were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. The risk factors of IVDD were analyzed by inverse variance weighting method, MR-Egger method, weighted median method, MR-PRESSO method and multivariate MR Method. Reverse Mendelian randomization analysis was performed on risk factors found to be caustically associated with IVDD in the forward Mendelian randomization analysis. The heterogeneity of instrumental variables was quantified using Cochran's Q statistic. Genetic predisposition to smoking (OR=1.221, 95% CI: 1.068-1.396), alcohol intake (OR=1.208, 95% CI: 1.056-1.328) and standing height (OR=1.149, 95% CI: 1.072-1.231) were associated with increased risk of IVDD. In addition, education level (OR=0.573, 95%CI: 0.502-0.654)and household income (OR=0.614, 95%CI: 0.445-0.847) had a protective effect on IVDD. Sleeplessness (OR=1.799, 95%CI: 1.162-2.783), hypertension (OR=2.113, 95%CI: 1.132-3.944) and type 2 diabetes (OR=1.069, 95%CI: 1.024-1.115) are three important risk factors causally associated with the IVDD. In addition, we demonstrated that increased levels of triglycerides (OR=1.080, 95%CI:1.013-1.151), fasting glucose (OR=1.189, 95%CI:1.007-1.405), and HbA1c (OR=1.308, 95%CI:1.017-1.683) could significantly increase the odds of IVDD. Hip osteoarthritis, HDL, apolipoprotein A-I, BMI and obesity trait factors showed bidirectional causal associations with IVDD, therefore we considered the causal associations between these risk factors and IVDD to be uncertain. This MR study provides evidence of complex causal associations between modifiable risk factors and IVDD. It is noteworthy that metabolic disturbances appear to have a more significant effect on IVDD than biomechanical alterations, as individuals with type 2 diabetes, elevated triglycerides, fasting glucose, and elevated HbA1c are at higher risk for IVDD, and the causal association of obesity-related characteristics with IVDD incidence is unclear.

To explore the causal relationships between the gut microbiota and AF using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Summary statistics were from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 207 gut microbial taxa (5 phyla, 10 classes, 13 orders, 26 families, 48 genera, and 105 species) (the Dutch Microbiome Project) and two large meta-GWASs of AF. The significant results were validated in FinnGen cohort and over 430,000 UK Biobank participants. Mediation MR analyses were conducted for AF risk factors, including type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), body mass index (BMI), blood lipids, blood pressure, and obstructive sleep apnea, to explore the potential mediation effect of these risk factors in between the gut microbiota and AF.

Type 1 diabetes was found to be a risk factor for bone metabolic health, although there was no clear evidence to support a genetic association between type 1 diabetes and osteoporosis and fracture risk. Based on the random assignment of gametes at conception, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis simulates randomized controlled trials in an observational setting. Therefore, we used MR to assess the association causality of type 1 diabetes (T1D) with fractures and osteoporosis. From a genome-wide association meta-analysis, independent single nucleotide polymorphisms closely associated with T1D were selected as instrumental variables. Data on fracture and osteoporosis were obtained from the FinnGen Consortium. We performed a two-sample MR analysis, using inverse-variance weighted (IVW) as the primary analysis method, to assess possible causal associations between T1D and bone risk. The results were verified by MR-Egger regression and median weighted method (WME). MR-PRESSO and MR-Egger intercepts were used to evaluate the horizontal pleiotropy of instrumental variables, and the Q-test and ""leave-one-out"" methods were used to test the heterogeneity of MR results. IVW (OR=1.040, 95% CI=0.974-1.109, P=0.238), MR-Egger regression (OR=1.077, 95% CI=0.921-1.260, P=0.372) and WME (OR=1.021, 95% CI=0.935-1.114, P=0.643) all showed that there was no causal relationship between T1D and osteoporosis, but the direction was consistent.

However, the associations between mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) and cancer risk are controversial. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed using three independent instrumental variables (IVs) to explore potential associations between mtDNA-CN and 20 types of cancer. The three sets of IVs were primarily obtained from participants in the UK Biobank and the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium using different methods. The outcome data of cancers were investigated using summary statistics from the FinnGen cohort. The potential causal associations were evaluated using the MR-Egger regression, weighted median, inverse-variance weighted (IVW), and weighted mode methods. The robustness of IVW estimates was validated using leave-one-out sensitivity analysis. Additionally, a meta-analysis was conducted to pool results from three sets of IVs. The results revealed that genetically predicted mtDNA-CN was not associated with cancer risk (odds ratio = 1.02; 95% confidence interval: 0.95-1.10). Subgroup analyses indicated no causal association between mtDNA-CN and breast, lung, prostate, skin, colorectal, gastric, liver, cervical uteri, esophageal, thyroid, bladder, pancreas, kidney, corpus uteri, ovary, brain, larynx, and anus cancers. It was observed that mtDNA-CN was associated with lip, oral cavity, and testis cancers. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because a small number of patients with lip and oral cavity or testis cancers were included.

We included 64 885 European patients with AMD and 568 740 control participants (with overlapped samples) in the UK Biobank, Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA), International AMD Consortium, FinnGen, and published early AMD GWASs in meta-analyses, as well as 733 European patients with AMD and 20 487 control participants from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) and non-Europeans from the UK Biobank and GERA for polygenic risk score validation. A multitrait meta-analysis of GWASs comprised 64 885 patients with AMD and 568 740 control participants; the multitrait approach accounted for sample overlap. We constructed a PRS for AMD based on both previously reported as well as unreported AMD loci. We applied the PRS to nonoverlapping data from the CLSA. We identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with AMD and established a PRS for AMD risk prediction. We identified 63 AMD risk loci alongside the well-established AMD loci CFH and ARMS2, including 9 loci that were not reported in previous GWASs, some of which previously were linked to other eye diseases such as glaucoma (e.g., HIC1). We applied our PRS to nonoverlapping data from the CLSA. A new PRS was constructed using the PRS method, PRS-CS, and significantly improved the prediction accuracy of AMD risk compared with PRSs from previously published datasets. We further showed that even people who carry all the well-known AMD risk alleles at CFH and ARMS2 vary considerably in their AMD risk (ranging from close to 0 in individuals with low PRS to > 50% in individuals with high PRS). Although our PRS was derived in individuals of European ancestry, the PRS shows potential for predicting risk in people of East Asian, South Asian, and Latino ancestry. Our findings improve the knowledge of the genetic architecture of AMD and help achieve better accuracy in AMD prediction.

We aimed to genetically assess the causality between modifiable factors (lifestyle factors, serum parameters, and metabolic comorbidities) and the risk of kidney stones. Additionally, we aimed to explore the causal impact of education on kidney stones and its potential mediating pathways. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to explore the causal association between 44 modifiable risk factors and kidney stones. The FinnGen dataset initially explored the causal relationship of risk factors with kidney stones and the UK Biobank dataset was used as the validation set. Then, a meta-analysis was conducted by combining discovery and validation datasets. We used two-step MR to assess potential mediators and their mediation proportions between education and kidney stones. The combined results indicated that previous exposures may increase the risk of kidney stones, including sedentary behavior, urinary sodium, the urinary sodium/potassium ratio, the urinary sodium/creatinine ratio, serum calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), the estimated creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcrea), GFR estimated by serum cystatin C (eGFRcys), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), fasting insulin, glycated hemoglobin, and hypertension. Coffee intake, plasma caffeine levels, educational attainment, and the urinary potassium/creatinine ratio may decrease the risk of kidney stones. Ranked by mediation proportion, the effect of education on the risk of kidney stones was mediated by five modifiable risk factors, including sedentary behavior (mediation proportion, 25.7%), smoking initiation (10.2%), BMI (8.2%), T2DM (5.8%), and waist circumference (3.2%). This study provides MR evidence supporting causal associations of many modifiable risk factors with kidney stones. Sedentary lifestyles, obesity, smoking, and T2DM are mediating factors in the causal relationship between educational attainment and kidney stones.

Our study used bi-directional, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis for predicting the causality between the BCAA levels and 9 types of cancers. The largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provided data for total BCAAs, valine, leucine, and isoleucine from the UK Biobank.

The mainly analysis method was the inverse-variance-weighted (IVW). For assessing horizontal pleiotropy, the researchers performed MR-Egger regression and MR-PRESSO global test. Finally, the Cochran's Q test served for evaluating the heterogeneity. Circulating total BCAAs levels (OR 1.708, 95%CI 1.168, 2.498; p = 0.006), valine levels (OR 1.747, 95%CI 1.217, 2.402; p < 0.001), leucine levels (OR 1.923, 95%CI 1.279, 2.890; p = 0.002) as well as isoleucine levels (OR 1.898, 95%CI 1.164, 3.094; p = 0.010) positively correlated with the squamous cell lung cancer risk. Nevertheless, no compelling evidence was found to support a causal link between BCAAs and any other examined cancers. Increased circulating total-BCAAs levels, leucine levels, isoleucine levels and valine levels had higher hazard of squamous cell lung cancer. No such associations were found for BCAAs with other cancers.","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2023,"Humans; Female; Isoleucine; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Leucine; Genome-Wide Association Study; Amino Acids, Branched-Chain; Valine; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Lung Neoplasms",False,8

Our analyses were conducted using white British participants of the UK Biobank (n = up to 255,196), the FinnGen cohort (up to 260,405), and available cancer consortia. We included cancers with previous evidence of an association with milk consumption in observational studies, as well as cancers common in both UK Biobank and FinnGen populations (>1000 cases). We evaluated phenotypic associations of milk intake and cancer incidence in the UK Biobank, and then used a Mendelian randomisation (MR) approach to assess causality in the UK Biobank, FinnGen consortium, and combined analyses incorporating additional consortia data for five cancers. In MR meta-analyses, case numbers for cancers of breast, ovary, uterus, cervix, prostate, bladder and urinary tract, colorectum, and lung ranged between 6000 and 148,000 cases, and between 780 and 1342 cases for cancers of the liver, mouth, stomach and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In observational analyses, milk consumption was associated with higher risk of bladder and urinary tract cancer (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.47), but not with any other cancer. This association was not confirmed in the MR analysis, and genetically predicted milk consumption showed a significant association only with lower risk of colorectal cancer (0.89, 0.81-0.98 per additional 50 g/day). In the MR analyses conducted among individual cohorts, genetically predicted milk consumption provided evidence for an association with lower colorectal cancer in the FinnGen cohort (0.85, 0.74-0.97), and in the UK Biobank greater risk of female breast cancer (1.12, 1.03-1.23), and uterine cancer in pre-menopausal females (3.98, 1.48-10.7). In a comprehensive survey of milk-cancer associations, we confirm of a protective role of milk consumption for colorectal cancer. Our analyses also provide some suggestion for higher risks of breast cancer and premenopausal uterine cancer, warranting further investigation.","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2023,"Male; Female; Humans; Animals; Milk; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Colorectal Neoplasms; Breast Neoplasms; Uterine Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,9

The single nucleotide polymorphisms concerning gut microbiome were retrieved from the gene-wide association study (GWAS) of the MiBioGen consortium. The summary statistics datasets of migraine, migraine with aura (MA), and migraine without aura (MO) were obtained from the GWAS meta-analysis of the International Headache Genetics Consortium (IHGC) and FinnGen consortium. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the primary method, complemented by sensitivity analyses for pleiotropy and increasing robustness. In IHGC datasets, ten, five, and nine bacterial taxa were found to have a causal association with migraine, MA, and MO, respectively, (IVW, all P < 0.05). Genus.Coprococcus3 and genus.Anaerotruncus were validated in FinnGen datasets. Nine, twelve, and seven bacterial entities were identified for migraine, MA, and MO, respectively. The causal association still exists in family.Bifidobacteriaceae and order.Bifidobacteriales for migraine and MO after FDR correction. The heterogeneity and pleiotropy analyses confirmed the robustness of IVW results. Our study demonstrates that gut microbiomes may exert causal effects on migraine, MA, and MO.

This study aimed to investigate the association between insulin use and asthma in a large population-based cohort, and further explore their causal relationship by Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. An epidemiological study including 85,887 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2018 was performed to evaluate the association between insulin use and asthma. Based on the inverse-variance weighted approach, MR analysis were conducted to estimate the causal effect of insulin use on asthma from the UKB and FinnGen datasets, respectively. In the NHANES cohort, we found that insulin use was associated with an increased risk of asthma [odd ratio (OR) 1.38; 95% CI 1.16-1.64; p < 0.001]. For the MR analysis, we found a causal relationship between insulin use and a higher risk of asthma in both Finn (OR 1.10; p < 0.001) and UK Biobank cohorts (OR 1.18; p < 0.001). Meanwhile, there was no causal association between diabetes and asthma.

FinnGen,37904677,Inflammatory bowel disease and the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage: A Mendelian randomization study and meta-analysis.,"The link between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is still unclear. We conducted a Mendelian randomization research and meta-analysis to explore the impact of IBD and its subtypes (Crohn's disease [CD], ulcerative colitis [UC]) on the risk of ICH. Two large genome-wide association analysis studies of International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) and International Stroke Genetics Consortium as exposure (IBD, UC, and CD) and outcome (ICH) in the initial stage. IBD, CD, UC GWAS data from the FinnGen consortium were adopted for the replication phase, and ultimately, the results of the initial stage and replication phase data were combined in a meta-analysis to evaluate the causal association between IBD and its subtypes and the risk of ICH. In the initial stage, we found that in the IVW (odds ratio [OR] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-0.96, p = .01), MR-PRESSO (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75-0.97, p = .02) and MR.RAPS (OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.98, p = .02) method showed that UC is associated with the risk of ICH. The causal relationship between IBD, CD, and the risk of ICH cannot be found by the IVW method. IBD and its subtypes UC, CD, and risk of ICH cannot find the presence of heterogeneity and pleiotropy. In replication stage, IBD (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.59-0.94, p = .0135) related to ICH, while the IVW approach did not establish a causal link in UC and CD. The meta-analysis still indicated that UC (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72-0.93, p < .05) would lessen the risk of ICH while the causality between IBD, CD, and ICH was unable to be established. UC was causally related to ICH, but IBD and CD are not associated with ICH.

In this biopsy-controlled, prospective, observational study, we characterized the liver and plasma lipidomes in patients with early ALD. We performed mass spectrometry-based lipidomics of paired liver and plasma samples from 315 patients with ALD and of plasma from 51 matched healthy controls. We associated lipid levels with histologic fibrosis, inflammation, and steatosis with correction for multiple testing and adjustment for confounders. We further investigated sphingolipid regulation by means of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction sequencing of microRNA, prediction of liver-related events, and tested causality with Mendelian randomization. We detected 198 lipids in the liver and 236 lipids in the circulation from 18 lipid classes. Most sphingolipids (sphingomyelins and ceramides) and phosphocholines were co-down-regulated in both liver and plasma, where lower abundance correlated with higher fibrosis stage. Sphingomyelins showed the most pronounced negative correlation to fibrosis, mirrored by negative correlations in both liver and plasma with hepatic inflammation. Reduced sphingomyelins predicted future liver-related events. This seemed to be characteristic of ""pure ALD,"" as sphingomyelin levels were higher in patients with concomitant metabolic syndrome and ALD/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease overlap. Mendelian randomization in FinnGen and UK Biobanks indicated ALD as the cause of low sphingomyelins, and alcohol use disorder did not correlate with genetic susceptibility to low sphingomyelin levels.

Current research on disc degeneration is placing a growing emphasis on the role of the immune system in this process. Nevertheless, the precise relationship between immunity and disc degeneration remains to be fully elucidated. We obtained GWAS data for immune cells from the latest summary-level GWAS, including 6,620 individuals from Sardinian and 746,667 individuals from five global populations. Summary results for IVDD were sourced from the FinnGen consortium, comprising 20,001 cases and 164,682 controls. We conducted a comprehensive univariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the potential causal relationship between immune cells and IVDD. Primary estimation was carried out using Inverse-Variance Weighting (IVW). To ensure robustness, we employed additional MR methods such as MR-Egger, Weighted Median, Weighted Mode, and Simple Mode. Various tests were employed to assess pleiotropy and heterogeneity, including the Cochran Q test, leave-one-out test, MR-Egger intercept analysis and MR-PRESSO test. To account for potential confounding factors among the immune cells, we conducted a multivariable MR analysis. Finally, we investigated the possibility of a reverse association between immune cells and IVDD through bidirectional MR. In total, our study identified 15 immune cells significantly associated with IVDD through univariable MR. Among these, 9 immune cell types were indicated as potential contributors to IVDD, while 6 were found to have protective effects. Importantly, we observed no evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy, signifying the robustness of our results. To mitigate confounding among immune cells, we utilized multivariable MR, leading to the discovery that only 9 immune cell types exerted independent effects on IVDD. These encompassed 7 as risk factors and 2 as protective factors. Additionally, our analysis revealed a bidirectional causal relationship between CD39+ CD4+ T cell %CD4+ T cell and IVDD. Our findings suggest a connection between immune cells and the risk of IVDD, shedding light on potential therapeutic avenues for modulating immune cell function in individuals with IVDD.

FinnGen,37654024,Association between 23 drugs and Parkinson's disease: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common degenerative nervous system disease. At present, there are certain limitations in various treatment options aimed at preventing or delaying the progression of PD. Therefore, the exploration of new drugs for PD is beneficial. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis can be used to explore the association between drugs and diseases. In this study, MR analysis was adopted to investigate the causal relationship between 23 drugs and PD. These drugs have been approved for the treatment of different diseases, such as salicylic acid and derivatives (collectively called salicylates, e.g., aspirin, used for fever and pain relief), antithrombotic agents (e.g., warfarin, aspirin, used for preventing thrombotic events). The GWAS data for the 23 drugs were obtained from the UK Biobank (UKB) project, while the GWAS data for PD were sourced from FinnGen. Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental variables (IVs). We first performed a series of quality control steps (including MR-PRESSO) to select the appropriate SNPs. Two-sample MR analysis was performed using five different methods, including inverse variance weighting (IVW) with random-effects model, weighted median, MR-Egger, simple model, and weighted model. At the same time, sensitivity analysis was carried out using the MR-Egger and Cochran's Q test to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the results. In MR-PRESSO, salicylates and antithrombotic agents showed statistically significant associations with PD, respectively. In the main MR analysis (IVW), there was a negative causal relationship between salicylates and PD (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.54-0.98, p = .039). Similarly, there was a negative causal relationship between antithrombotic agents and PD (OR = 0.70, 95%CI = 0.52-0.96, p = .027).

Nonetheless, the association observed in these studies is not entirely conclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic causal relationship between educational attainment and 12 musculoskeletal disorders using Mendelian randomization (MR). The meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified 3952 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with educational attainment (EA) from the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium (SSGAC). Genetic data for 12 musculoskeletal disorders, including osteonecrosis, osteoporosis, osteomyelitis, low back pain, gout, spinal stenosis, rheumatoid arthritis, meniscus derangement, rotator cuff syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, cervicobrachial syndrome, and lateral epicondylitis, were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to examine the causal effect of EA on the risk of these musculoskeletal disorders using the TwoSampleMR package in R. Based on the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, we found that a genetically predicted per standard deviation (SD) increase in EA was inversely associated with low back pain [odds ratio (OR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.51-0.61, p < 0.001], spinal stenosis (OR 0.62, 95% Cl 0.54-0.71, p < 0.001), rheumatoid arthritis (OR 0.65, 95% Cl 0.55-0.76, p < 0.001), meniscus derangement (OR 0.73, 95% Cl 0.65-0.82, p < 0.001), rotator cuff syndrome (OR 0.55, 95% Cl 0.49-0.61, p < 0.001), cervicobrachial syndrome (OR 0.50, 95% Cl 0.42-0.60, p < 0.001), and lateral epicondylitis (OR 0.30, 95% Cl 0.24-0.37, p < 0.001). There was no causal association between EA and osteonecrosis (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.76-1.72, p = 0.60), osteoporosis (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65-1.27, p = 0.59), or osteomyelitis (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75-1.01, p = 0.22). Genetic predisposition to EA had a suggestive causal association with gout (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.95, p = 0.01) and ankylosing spondylitis (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.91, p = 0.01) after Bonferroni correction.

FinnGen,38019753,Causal association between dietary factors and esophageal diseases: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Using Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, our objective was to determine whether there was a causal association between dietary factors and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus (BE), or esophageal cancer (EC). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for eighteen types of dietary intake were obtained from the UK Biobank. GWAS data for GERD, BE, and EC were sourced from the FinnGen consortium. We performed univariable and multivariable MR analysis to assess the cause effect between dietary factors and esophageal diseases. MR results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Raw vegetable intake was associated with a lower risk of GERD (OR = 0.478; P = 0.011). On the contrary, cooked vegetable intake increased the risk of GERD (OR = 1.911; P = 0.024). Bread intake was associated with increased odds of BE (OR = 6.754; P = 0.007), while processed meat intake was associated with reduced risk of BE (OR = 0.210; P = 0.035). We also observed evidence that increased consumption of dried fruit (OR = 0.087; P = 0.022) and salt added to food (OR = 0.346; P = 0.045) could prevent EC. The results of multivariable MR showed that the protective effect of consumption of salt added to food on EC was no longer significant after adjusting for the consumption of dried fruit. Vegetable consumption was associated with GERD, whereas consumption of bread and processed meat was associated with BE. Dried fruit intake was associated with a lower risk of EC, and the protective effect of consumption of salt added food on EC may also be mediated by consumption of dried fruit. Future research should be performed to investigate the mechanisms behind these cause-and-effect relationships to reduce the burden of disease caused by dietary habits.",PloS one,2023,Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Barrett Esophagus; Esophageal Neoplasms; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Fruit; Vegetables,False,7
FinnGen,37079300,Overlap of Genetic Loci for Central Serous Chorioretinopathy With Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a serous maculopathy of unknown etiology. Two of 3 previously reported CSC genetic risk loci are also associated with AMD. Improved understanding of CSC genetics may broaden our understanding of this genetic overlap and unveil mechanisms in both diseases. To identify novel genetic risk factors for CSC and compare genetic risk factors for CSC and AMD. Using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth (ICD-9) and Tenth (ICD-10) Revision code-based inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients with CSC and controls were identified in both the FinnGen study and the Estonian Biobank (EstBB). Also included in a meta-analysis were previously reported patients with chronic CSC and controls. Data were analyzed from March 1 to September 31, 2022. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were performed in the biobank-based cohorts followed by a meta-analysis of all cohorts. The expression of genes prioritized by the polygenic priority score and nearest-gene methods were assessed in cultured choroidal endothelial cells and public ocular single-cell RNA sequencing data sets. The predictive utility of polygenic scores (PGSs) for CSC and AMD were evaluated in the FinnGen study. A total of 1176 patients with CSC and 526 787 controls (312 162 female [59.3%]) were included in this analysis: 552 patients with CSC and 343 461 controls were identified in the FinnGen study, 103 patients with CSC and 178 573 controls were identified in the EstBB, and 521 patients with chronic CSC and 3577 controls were included in a meta-analysis. Two previously reported CSC risk loci were replicated (near CFH and GATA5) and 3 novel loci were identified (near CD34/46, NOTCH4, and PREX1). The CFH and NOTCH4 loci were associated with AMD but in the opposite direction. Prioritized genes showed increased expression in cultured choroidal endothelial cells compared with other genes in the loci (median [IQR] of log 2 [counts per million], 7.3 [0.6] vs 4.7 [3.7]; P = .004) and were differentially expressed in choroidal vascular endothelial cells in single-cell RNA sequencing data (mean [SD] fold change, 2.05 [0.38] compared with other cell types; P < 7.1 × 10-20). A PGS for AMD was predictive of reduced CSC risk (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70-0.83 per +1 SD in AMD-PGS; P = 7.4 × 10-10). This association may have been mediated by loci containing complement genes. In this 3-cohort genetic association study, 5 genetic risk loci for CSC were identified, highlighting a likely role for genes involved in choroidal vascular function and complement regulation. Results suggest that polygenic AMD risk was associated with reduced risk of CSC and that this genetic overlap was largely due to loci containing complement genes.",JAMA ophthalmology,2023,Humans; Female; Central Serous Chorioretinopathy; Genome-Wide Association Study; Endothelial Cells; Genetic Loci; Macular Degeneration; Genetic Background,False,8
FinnGen,37753071,Causal relationships between circulating inflammatory factors and IgA vasculitis: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"IgA vasculitis (IgAV) is an immune-associated vasculitis, yet its exact etiology remains unclear. Here, we explore the interaction between IgAV and inflammatory factors using bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR). We conducted a bidirectional summary-level MR analysis to delineate the causality of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and 41 circulating inflammatory regulators with IgAV. Data on genetic variants related to inflammation were obtained from three genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on CRP, PCT, and human cytokines, whereas data on IgAV was from large meta-analyses of GWAS among 216 569 FinnGen Biobank participants. The primary MR analysis was performed using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) approach, and the sensitivity analyses were carried out using MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier. This study revealed the association of CRP higher levels with increased risk of IgAV through IVW method (Estimate odds ratio [OR] = 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.98,  Our current study using bidirectional MR analysis provides compelling evidence for a causal effect of CRP, PCT, and circulating inflammatory regulators on IgAV.

FinnGen,37914780,Causal effect of gallstone disease on the risk of coronary heart disease or acute myocardial infarction: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Gallstone disease (GSD) is thought to be associated with the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which may be due to abnormal cholesterol metabolism. We used multiple Mendelian randomization (MR) methods based on publicly available genome-wide association study data to assess whether this association is genetically causal and to search for loci driving causality. Pooled data for GSD were obtained from FinnGen Biobank and Biobank Japan, while CHD and AMI were obtained as pooled data from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium. In this MR study, we found a significant negative causal effect of genetic susceptibility to GSD on AMI in the Finnish population, but no causal effect was found on CHD. This causal effect was not confounded by reverse causality and the same findings were obtained in the Japanese population. Furthermore, the negative causal effect of GSD on AMI risk may be driven by the rs4245791-regulated ABCG5/8 protein. In conclusion, the results of this MR study support a negative causal effect of GSD on AMI and suggest that rs4245791 is the causal driver locus of this effect, which provides new ideas and evidence for the prevention and etiologic study of AMI in patients with GSD.",Scientific reports,2023,Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Coronary Disease; Myocardial Infarction; Cholelithiasis,False,7

Herein, Mendelian randomization was employed to identify the causal effect of inflammatory bowel disease on kidney function and the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), urolithiasis, and IgA nephropathy. The International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium provided the summary-level genome-wide association study (GWAS) data that correlates with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). GWAS data for estimated glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine (eGFRcrea), urine albumin-creatinine ratio (uACR), and CKD were obtained from the CKDGen Consortium, and GWAS data for urolithiasis were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. The summary-level GWAS data for IgA nephropathy were obtained from the meta-analysis of UK-biobank, FinnGen, and Biobank Japan. Inverse-variance weighted was used as the primary estimate. Furthermore, the Steiger test was used to validate the direction of causality. The inverse-variance weighted data revealed that genetically predicted UC significantly increased uACR levels, while genetically predicted CD significantly increased the risk of urolithiasis.

However, it remains uncertain whether these associations are causal due to confounding factors or reverse causality. We aim to explore the causality between circulating cytokines and VTE, encompassing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).  In the current bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study, instrumental variables of 41 circulating cytokines were obtained from the genome-wide association study meta-analyses (8,293 individuals).

FinnGen,36747475,Genetic variants associated with syncope implicate neural and autonomic processes.,"Syncope is a common and clinically challenging condition. In this study, the genetics of syncope were investigated to seek knowledge about its pathophysiology and prognostic implications. This genome-wide association meta-analysis included 56 071 syncope cases and 890 790 controls from deCODE genetics (Iceland), UK Biobank (United Kingdom), and Copenhagen Hospital Biobank Cardiovascular Study/Danish Blood Donor Study (Denmark), with a follow-up assessment of variants in 22 412 cases and 286 003 controls from Intermountain (Utah, USA) and FinnGen (Finland). The study yielded 18 independent syncope variants, 17 of which were novel. One of the variants, p.Ser140Thr in PTPRN2, affected syncope only when maternally inherited. Another variant associated with a vasovagal reaction during blood donation and five others with heart rate and/or blood pressure regulation, with variable directions of effects. None of the 18 associations could be attributed to cardiovascular or other disorders. Annotation with regard to regulatory elements indicated that the syncope variants were preferentially located in neural-specific regulatory regions. Mendelian randomization analysis supported a causal effect of coronary artery disease on syncope. A polygenic score (PGS) for syncope captured genetic correlation with cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, depression, and shortened lifespan. However, a score based solely on the 18 syncope variants performed similarly to the PGS in detecting syncope risk but did not associate with other disorders. The results demonstrate that syncope has a distinct genetic architecture that implicates neural regulatory processes and a complex relationship with heart rate and blood pressure regulation. A shared genetic background with poor cardiovascular health was observed, supporting the importance of a thorough assessment of individuals presenting with syncope.",European heart journal,2023,Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Syncope; Cardiovascular Diseases; Autonomic Nervous System; Diabetes Mellitus; Mendelian Randomization Analysis,False,7

FinnGen,37805474,Causal relationship between blood metabolites and risk of five infections: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Infectious diseases continue to pose a significant threat in the field of global public health, and our understanding of their metabolic pathogenesis remains limited. However, the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) offers an unprecedented opportunity to unravel the relationship between metabolites and infections. Univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) was commandeered to elucidate the causal relationship between blood metabolism and five high-frequency infection phenotypes: sepsis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), urinary tract infections (UTI), and skin and subcutaneous tissue infection (SSTI). GWAS data for infections were derived from UK Biobank and the FinnGen consortium. The primary analysis was conducted using the inverse variance weighted method on the UK Biobank data, along with a series of sensitivity analyses. Subsequently, replication and meta-analysis were performed on the FinnGen consortium data. After primary analysis and a series of sensitivity analyses, 17 metabolites were identified from UK Biobank that have a causal relationship with five infections. Upon joint analysis with the FinGen cohort, 7 of these metabolites demonstrated consistent associations. Subsequently, we conducted a multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis to confirm the independent effects of these metabolites. Among known metabolites, genetically predicted 1-stearoylglycerol (1-SG) (odds ratio [OR] = 0.561, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.403-0.780, P < 0.001) and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoate (CMPF) (OR = 0.780, 95%CI: 0.689-0.883, P < 0.001) was causatively associated with a lower risk of sepsis, and genetically predicted phenylacetate (PA) (OR = 1.426, 95%CI: 1.152-1.765, P = 0.001) and cysteine (OR = 1.522, 95%CI: 1.170-1.980, P = 0.002) were associated with an increased risk of UTI. Ursodeoxycholate (UDCA) (OR = 0.906, 95%CI: 0.829-0.990, P = 0.029) is a protective factor against pneumonia.

FinnGen,37515404,Association between the use of lipid-lowering drugs and the risk of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Observational studies have suggested an association between lipid-lowering drugs and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk. This study aimed to assess the causal influence of lipid-lowering agents on IBD risk using Mendelian randomization analysis. In a population of 173,082 individuals of European ancestry, 55 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified as instrumental variables for 6 lipid-lowering drug targets (HMGCR, NPC1LC, PCSK9, LDLR, CETP and APOB). Summary statistics for the genome-wide association study of IBD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) were obtained from the FinnGen consortium, Program in Complex Trait Genomics and UK Biobank. Inverse-variance weighted was employed as the primary MR method, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals were reported as the results. Sensitivity analyses using conventional MR methods were conducted to assess result robustness. Gene-proxied inhibition of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) was associated with an increased IBD risk (OR [95% CI]: 2.31 [1.38, 3.85]; p = .001), particularly in UC (OR [95% CI]: 2.40 [1.21, 4.74], p = .012), but not in CD.

This study used the Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the relationships between genetic predisposition to blood sitosterol concentration and 11 CVD endpoints, along with the potential mediating effects of blood lipids and hematological traits. Random-effect inverse-variance weighted method was used as the main analysis of MR. Genetic instruments of sitosterol (seven SNPs, F = 253, and R Genetically predicted one unit increment in log-transformed blood total sitosterol was significantly associated with a higher risk of coronary atherosclerosis (OR: 1.52; 95 % CI: 1.41, 1.65; n = 667,551), myocardial infarction (OR: 1.40; 95 % CI: 1.25, 1.56; n = 596,436), all coronary heart disease (OR: 1.33; 95 % CI: 1.22, 1.46; n = 766,053), intracerebral hemorrhage (OR: 1.68; 95 % CI: 1.24, 2.27; n = 659,181), heart failure (OR: 1.16; 95 % CI: 1.08, 1.25; n = 1,195,531), and aortic aneurysm (OR: 1.74; 95 % CI: 1.42, 2.13; n = 665,714). Suggestive associations were observed for an increased risk of ischemic stroke (OR: 1.06; 95 % CI: 1.01, 1.12; n = 2,021,995) and peripheral artery disease (OR: 1.20; 95 % CI: 1.05, 1.37; n = 660,791). Notably, blood non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (nonHDL-C) and apolipoprotein B mediated about 38-47 %, 46-60 %, and 43-58 % of the associations between sitosterol and coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and coronary heart disease, respectively. However, the associations between sitosterol and CVDs were less likely to depend on hematological traits. The study suggests that genetic predisposition to higher blood total sitosterol is linked to a greater risk of major CVDs. Moreover, blood nonHDL-C and apolipoprotein B might mediate a significant proportion of the associations between sitosterol and coronary diseases.",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,2023,"Humans; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronary Artery Disease; Sitosterols; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Phytosterols; Genome-Wide Association Study; Risk Factors; Lipids; Myocardial Infarction; Cholesterol; Apolipoproteins; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8

However, its causes have never been fully understood. The objective of our study was to analyze the causal association between various factors and uterine leiomyoma using Mendelian randomization (MR). Genetic variables associated with risk factors were obtained from genome-wide association studies. Summary-level statistical data for uterine leiomyoma were obtained from FinnGen and the UK Biobank (UKB) consortium. We used inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, and weighted median methods in univariate analysis. Multivariable MR analysis was used to identify independent risk factors. A fixed-effect model meta-analysis was used to combine the results of the FinnGen and UKB data. In the FinnGen data, higher genetically predicted age at natural menopause, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and fasting insulin were associated with an increased risk of uterine leiomyoma, while higher age at menarche was associated with a reduced risk of uterine leiomyoma. Multivariable MR analysis of SBP and DBP showed that higher DBP might be an independent risk factor of uterine leiomyoma. In the UKB data, the results for age at natural menopause, SBP, DBP, and age at menarche were replicated. The result of the meta-analysis suggested that uterine leiomyoma could also be affected by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and 2-hour glucose level. Our MR study confirmed that earlier menstrual age, hypertension, obesity, and elevated 2-hour glucose post-challenge were risk factors for uterine leiomyoma, and the causal relationship between smoking and uterine leiomyoma was ruled out. In addition, later age of menopause and endometriosis were found to increase the risk of uterine leiomyoma, while PCOS was found to decrease the risk.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023,Female; Humans; Endometriosis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Leiomyoma; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Glucose,False,8

The unique role of gut microbiota in urological tumors is gaining prominence. However, it is still controversial whether the dysbiosis of gut microbiota should be one of the etiological factors of bladder cancer (BCa), prostate cancer (PCa) or kidney cancer (KCa). The microbiome genome-wide association study (GWAS) from the MiBioGen consortium (18,340 samples of 24 population-based cohorts) was utilized as the exposure data. Additionally, outcomes data (951 BCa cases and 307,092 controls; 1,631 KCa cases and 238,678 controls; 79,148 PCa cases and 61,106 controls) were extracted from the GWAS of the FinnGen and PRACTICAL consortia. To detect the potential causative bacterial traits for BCa, PCa, and KCa, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed, employing the inverse-variance weighted or Wald ratio method. Sensitivity analyses were subsequently conducted to explore the robustness of the primary results. Finally, the reverse MR analysis was undertaken to mitigate the reverse causation. This study suggested that Bifidobacterium (p = 0.030), Actinobacteria (p = 0.037 for phylum, 0.041 for class), and Ruminococcustorques group (p = 0.018), exhibited an association with an increased risk of BCa using either the inverse-variance weighted or Wald ratio method. By utilizing the Wald ratio method, Allisonella (p = 0.004, p = 0.038) was associated with a decreased risk of BCa and PCa, respectively. Furthermore, Ruminococcustorques group (p = 0.028) and Erysipelatoclostridium (p = 0.048) were causally linked to an elevated risk of KCa.

FinnGen,37492198,Integrated multiple-microarray analysis and mendelian randomization to identify novel targets involved in diabetic nephropathy.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN), which is the main cause of renal failure in end-stage renal disease, is becoming a common chronic renal disease worldwide. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a genetic tool that is widely used to minimize confounding and reverse causation when identifying the causal effects of complex traits. In this study, we conducted an integrated multiple microarray analysis and large-scale plasma proteome MR analysis to identify candidate biomarkers and evaluate the causal effects of prospective therapeutic targets in DN. Five DN gene expression datasets were selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus. The robust rank aggregation (RRA) method was used to integrate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of glomerular samples between patients with DN and controls, followed by functional enrichment analysis. Protein quantitative trait loci were incorporated from seven different proteomic genome-wide association studies, and genetic association data on DN were obtained from FinnGen (3676 cases and 283,456 controls) for two-sample MR analysis. External validation and clinical correlation were also conducted. A total of 82 DEGs (53 upregulated and 29 downregulated) were identified through RRA integrated analysis. The enriched Gene Ontology annotations and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways of the DEGs were significantly enriched in neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil activation, proteoglycan binding, collagen binding, secretory granule lumen, gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and pentose phosphate pathways. MR analysis revealed that the genetically predicted levels of MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B (MICB), granzyme A (GZMA), cathepsin S (CTSS), chloride intracellular channel protein 5, and ficolin-1 (FCN1) were causally associated with DN risk. Expression validation and clinical correlation analysis showed that MICB, GZMA, FCN1, and insulin-like growth factor 1 may participate in the development of DN, and carbonic anhydrase 2 and lipoprotein lipase may play protective roles in patients with DN.

We performed the proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) design to estimate the causal associations of protein levels with PSC risk. Therein, genetic associations with 4,907 plasma protein levels were extracted from a proteome-wide genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 35,559 individuals and those with PSC were obtained from the International PSC Study Group (2,871 cases and 12,019 controls) and the FinnGen study (1,491 cases and 301,383 controls). The colocalization analysis was performed to detect causal variants shared by proteins and PSC. The identified proteins were further enriched in pathways and diseases. A phenome-wide association screening was performed and potential drugs were assessed as well. The results indicated that genetically predicted plasma levels of 14 proteins were positively associated with an increased risk of PSC and 8 proteins were inversely associated with PSC risk in both PSC GWAS data sets, and they all survived in sensitivity analyses. The colocalization indicated that AIF1 (allograft inflammatory factor 1) and HLA-DQA2 (major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ alpha 2) were shared proteins with PSC, and they should be direct targets for PSC. The phenome-wide screening suggested that variants located at AIF1 or HLA-DQA2 region were closely associated with several autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, implicating the shared pathogenesis among them.

GM taxa that appear to act within the gut-retina axis may affect the risk of AMD. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 196 GM taxa were obtained from the MiBioGen consortium, and a Mendelian randomization (MR) study was carried out to estimate the causality between GM taxa and AMD (defined as an endpoint based on ICD-9 and ICD-10). Using the data from the FinnGen consortium (6157 patients and 288,237 controls), we explored the GM taxa for causality and verified the results at the replication stage based on the MRC-IEU consortium (3553 cases and 147,089 controls). Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was the main method used to analyze causality, and the MR results were verified using heterogeneity tests and pleiotropy tests.

We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 data, with exposure as serum SHBG and outcome as osteoporosis and performed multivariate logistic regression to test the correlation between SHBG and osteoporosis. To determine the causal relationship between SHBG and osteoporosis, a two-sample bidirectional MR was employed. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset for SHBG (n = 189,473) was obtained from the IEU database, and the GWAS dataset for osteoporosis (n = 212,778) was obtained from the FinnGen bioBank. The principal MR technique was inverse-variance weighting (IVW). In MR analyses, the MR-Egger intercept and Cochran Q test were used to detect multiple validity and horizontal heterogeneity. 1249 older adult participants (age ≥ 60) were involved in the cross-sectional study, including 113 osteoporosis cases. We identified a significant relationship between circulating SHBG concentration and osteoporosis risk [OR 3.963, 95% CI (2.095-7.495), P < 0.05]. Subgroup analysis indicated that SHBG was closely linked to the risk of osteoporosis in the female population [OR 1.008, 95% CI (1.002-1.013), P = 0.005] but not in males (P = 0.065). In addition, The IVW approach suggested a causal connection between SHBG and increased osteoporosis risk [OR 1.479, 95% CI (1.144-1.912), P = 0.003], and the MR-Egger intercept and the Cochran Q test validated the consistency of the MR results. Finally, the reverse MR analysis declined to identify a causal relation between SHBG and osteoporosis.

BMDs of four sites (total body, n = 56,284; femoral neck, n = 32,735; lumbar spine, n = 28,498; forearm, n = 8143) were from the GEnetic Factors for OSteoporosis Consortium. Data for alcohol consumption (n = 112,117) and smoking (n = 33,299) and serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level (n = 417,580) were from UK-biobank. We first performed univariate MR analysis with the Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method as the primary analysis to investigate the genetically predicted effect of ALD or NAFLD on BMD. Then, multivariate MR and mediation analysis were performed to identify whether the effect was mediated by alcohol consumption, smoking, or serum 25-OHD level. The MR results suggested a robust genetically predicted effect of ALD on reduced BMD in the femoral neck (FN-BMD) (IVW beta = -0.0288; 95% CI: -0.0488, -0.00871; P = 0.00494) but not the other three sites. Serum 25-OHD level exhibited a significant mediating effect on the association between ALD and reduced FN-BMD albeit the proportion of mediation was mild (2.21%). No significant effects of NAFLD, alcohol consumption, or smoking on BMD in four sites, or reverse effect of BMD on ALD or NAFLD were detected. Our findings confirm the genetically predicted effect of ALD on reduced FN-BMD, and highlight the importance of periodic BMD and serum 25-OHD monitoring and vitamin D supplementation as needed in patients with ALD. Future research is required to validate our results and investigate the probable underlying mechanisms.",PloS one,2023,"Humans; Bone Density; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Vitamin D; Osteoporosis; Calcifediol; Lumbar Vertebrae; Liver Diseases, Alcoholic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8
FinnGen,37814277,Low levels of small HDL particles predict but do not influence risk of sepsis.,"Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been associated with higher rates and severity of infection. Alterations in inflammatory mediators and infection are associated with alterations in HDL cholesterol. It is unknown whether the association between HDL and infection is present for all particle sizes, and whether the observed associations are confounded by IL-6 signalling. In the UK Biobank, ~ 270,000 individuals have data on HDL subclasses derived from nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. We estimated the association of particle count of total HDL and HDL subclasses (small, medium, large, and extra-large HDL) with sepsis, sepsis-related death, and critical care admission in a Cox regression model. We subsequently utilised genetic data from UK Biobank and FinnGen to perform Mendelian randomisation (MR) of each HDL subclass and sepsis to test for a causal relationship. Finally, we explored the role of IL-6 signalling as a potential causal driver of changes in HDL subclasses. In observational analyses, higher particle count of small HDL was associated with protection from sepsis (Hazard ratio, HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.74-0.86, p = 4 × 10 Low number of small HDL particles are associated with increased hazard of sepsis, sepsis-related death, and sepsis-related critical care admission. However, genetic analyses did not strongly support this as causal. Instead, we demonstrate that increased IL-6 signalling, which is known to alter infection risk, could confound associations with reduced HDL particle count, and suggest this may explain part of the observed association between (small) HDL particle count and sepsis.","Critical care (London, England)",2023,"Humans; Interleukin-6; Cholesterol, HDL; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Proportional Hazards Models; Sepsis",False,8

We conducted a Mendelian randomization study to investigate whether higher plasma caffeine levels are causally associated with the risk of anorexia nervosa, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia. Summary-level data on the neuropsychiatric disorders were obtained from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of European ancestry participants (n = 72,517 to 807,553) and meta-analyzed with the corresponding data from the FinnGen study (n = 356,077). Summary-level data on plasma caffeine were extracted from a GWAS meta-analysis of 9876 European ancestry individuals. The Mendelian randomization analyses estimated the Wald ratio for each genetic variant and meta-analyzed the variant-specific estimates using multiplicative random effects meta-analysis. After correcting for multiple testing, genetically predicted higher plasma caffeine levels were associated with higher odds of anorexia nervosa (odds ratio [OR] = 1.124; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.024-1.238, p These Mendelian randomization findings indicate that long-term higher plasma caffeine levels may lower the risk of bipolar disorder and MDD but increase the risk of anorexia nervosa.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with serum magnesium and calcium were used as the instrumental variables. MR analyses were performed using the summary-level data for epilepsy extracted from International League Against Epilepsy Consortium (15,212 cases and 29,677 controls) to obtain the causal estimates. The analyses were replicated using FinnGen data (7224 epilepsy cases and 208,845 controls), and a meta-analysis was then conducted. The result of combined analyses showed that higher serum magnesium concentrations was associated with a reduced risk of overall epilepsy (odds ratios [OR] = 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.62, p = 0.002). In ILAE, higher serum magnesium was suggestively associated with reduced risks of focal epilepsy (OR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.10-0.62, p = 0.003). However, the results cannot be repeated in sensitivity analyses. As for serum calcium, the results did not reach statistical significance with overall epilepsy (OR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.31-1.17, p = 0.134). However, genetically predicted serum calcium concentrations showed an inverse association with risk of generalized epilepsy (OR = 0.35, 95% CI, 0.17-0.74, p = 0.006).

FinnGen,37403021,Assessing the genetic relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease and chronic respiratory diseases: a mendelian randomization study.,"Previous observational studies have found an association between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and chronic respiratory diseases, but it remains uncertain whether GERD causally influences these diseases. In this study, we aimed to estimate the causal associations between GERD and 5 chronic respiratory diseases. 88 GERD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by the latest genome-wide association study were included as instrumental variables. Individual-level genetic summary data of participants were obtained from corresponding studies and the FinnGen consortium. We applied the inverse-variance weighted method to estimate the causality between genetically predicted GERD and 5 chronic respiratory diseases. Furthermore, the associations between GERD and common risk factors were investigated, and mediation analyses were conducted using multivariable MR. Various sensitivity analyses were also performed to verify the robustness of the findings. Our study demonstrated that genetically predicted GERD was causally associated with an increased risk of asthma (OR 1.39, 95%CI 1.25-1.56, P < 0.001), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.05-1.95, P = 0.022), chronic obstructive disease (COPD) (OR 1.64, 95%CI 1.41-1.93, P < 0.001), chronic bronchitis (OR 1.77, 95%CI 1.15-2.74, P = 0.009), while no correlation was observed for bronchiectasis (OR 0.93, 95%CI 0.68-1.27, P = 0.645). Additionally, GERD was associated with 12 common risk factors for chronic respiratory diseases. Nevertheless, no significant mediators were discovered.

This study utilizes comprehensive genome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses, using genomic data, to identify potential therapeutic approaches for EM. Genome-wide cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) data were obtained from GTEx V8, which included 838 participants across 49 tissues or cells, and the eQTLGen consortium, which included 31,684 participants. Genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) data for EM were sourced from the FinnGen study, which consisted of 8,288 cases and 68,969 controls, as well as the UK Biobank study, which included 1,496 cases and 359,698 controls. This study utilized MR analysis to assess the correlation between genes and the risk of EM. Subsequently, colocalization analysis was conducted to investigate potential shared causal variants between the identified genes and EM. After conducting MR and colocalization analyses, we identified a total of 13 genes that showed significant evidence of colocalization. These genes are considered promising therapeutic candidates for treating EM. Among them, inner membrane mitochondrial protein (IMMT), src kinase associated phosphoprotein 1 (SKAP1), lysine methyltransferase 5A (KMT5A), KLF transcription factor 12 (KLF12), GRB10 interacting GYF protein 1 (GIGYF1), Wnt family member 7A (WNT7A), Sad1 and UNC84 domain containing 1 (SUN1), and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 3 (PARP3) were found to have positive associations with the risk of EM.

However, the causal effect is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of genetically determined BCAA levels on CVDs and their risk factors using Mendelian randomization (MR). We performed univariable and multivariable MR analyses using summary-level data from multiple GWASs and the FinnGen consortium to investigate the association between BCAA levels and the risk of CVDs (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage) and their risk factors (atrial fibrillation, hypertension, heart failure, and valvular heart disease). We used the random-effects IVW approach as the primary statistical method and incorporated MR estimates from different data sources using the fixed-effects model. We found genetically determined total and individual BCAA levels and a high risk of hypertension. However, there is no evidence of a causal relationship between BCAA levels and 3 cardiovascular diseases and other their risk factors.

We aimed to investigate the causal effect of relative carbohydrate intake on hypertension and the mediating roles of psychological well-being and adiposity. Using summary-level statistics of genome-wide association studies of European ancestry, we conducted univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the bidirectional causal association between relative carbohydrate intake (total energy-adjusted, mean: 42-51%) and hypertension (FinnGen: 42,857 cases/162,837 controls; UK Biobank: 77,723 cases/330,366 controls) and two-step MR to assess the mediating effects of psychological well-being indicators and adiposity traits on the association. MR estimates of hypertension from FinnGen and UK Biobank were meta-analyzed using the fixed-effect model given no heterogeneity. Meta-analyses of multivariable MR estimates from FinnGen and UK Biobank indicated that each one-SD higher relative carbohydrate intake was associated with 71% (odds ratio: 0.29; 95% confidence interval: 0.11-0.79) lower risk of hypertension, independently of other dietary macronutrients. Hypertension showed no reverse effect on carbohydrate intake. Five psychological well-being indicators and four adiposity traits causally mediated the association between relative carbohydrate intake and hypertension, including body mass index (mediation proportion: 51.37%), waist circumference (40.54%), waist-to-hip ratio (35.00%), hip circumference (24.77%), major depressive disorder (23.37%), positive affect (17.08%), depressive symptoms (16.52%), life satisfaction (16.05%), and neuroticism (11.22%).

Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed utilizing two sets of genetic variants as instruments (six and two single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) associated with SLC5A2 gene expression and glycated hemoglobin A1c levels. Summary statistics of BMD from the Genetic Factors for Osteoporosis consortium (BMD for total body, n = 66,628; femoral neck, n = 32,735; lumbar spine, n = 28,498; forearm, n = 8143) and osteoporosis (6303 cases, 325,717 controls) and 13 types of fracture (≤17,690 cases, ≤328,382 controls) data from the FinnGen study were obtained. One-sample MR and genetic association analyses were conducted in UK Biobank using the individual-level data of heel BMD (n = 256,286) and incident osteoporosis (13,677 cases, 430,262 controls) and fracture (25,806 cases, 407,081 controls). Using six SNPs as the instrument, genetically proxied SGLT2 inhibition showed little evidence of association with BMD of total body, femoral neck, lumbar spine, and forearm (all p ≥ 0.077). Similar results were observed using two SNPs as instruments. Little evidence was found for the SGLT2 inhibition effect on osteoporosis (all p ≥ 0.112) or any 11 major types of fracture (all p ≥ 0.094), except for a nominal significance for fracture of lower leg (p = 0.049) and shoulder and upper arm (p = 0.029). One-sample MR and genetic association analysis showed that both the weighted genetic risk scores constructed from the six and two SNPs were not causally associated with heel BMD, osteoporosis, and fracture (all p ≥ 0.387).

FinnGen,38123520,Psychological Distress and Meniere's Disease: A Bidirectional Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study.,"This study is aim to explore the causal relationship between anxiety, depression, neuroticism, and Meniere's disease (MD). Two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. IEU, FinnGen, CTG, and UKB databases. The genome-wide association studies data for anxiety, depression, neuroticism, and MD involved over 357,957 participants. MR was performed to explore relationships between anxiety, depression, neuroticism, and MD. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the MR results. Reverse MR was used to exclude the possibility of reverse causality. Finally, multivariate MR was performed to explore the collinear relationships between neuroticism subclusters. MR results showed that anxiety and depression are not causes of MD, nor does MD cause anxiety and depression. Elevated neuroticism sum score is a cause of anxiety, depression, and MD, but MD does not lead to an increase in the level of neuroticism sum score. Further analysis showed that the 5 subclusters of neuroticism often feel lonely, mood often goes up and down, often feel fed-up, feelings easily hurt, and sensitivity to environmental stress and adversity are causes of MD. Multivariate MR analysis results suggested that the 5 neuroticism subclusters have a collinear relationship. Anxiety and depression are not causative factors of MD, and vice versa. Elevated neuroticism levels serve as a shared causative factor for anxiety, depression, and MD. Identification and effective management of neuroticism is a potential target for preventing and treating MD.",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,2024,Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Meniere Disease; Psychological Distress; Neuroticism; Genome-Wide Association Study; Depression; Anxiety; Male; Female,False,9
FinnGen,37916519,Causal relationship between sleep apnea and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies indicate that sleep apnea is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its related metabolic features, independent of confounding factors including obesity. However, the causal relationships remain to be determined. Univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to investigate the causal relationship between sleep apnea and NAFLD, along with its typical features including liver function, glycemic traits and lipid profiles. Summary-level data for sleep apnea were obtained from the Finngen consortium (33,423 cases and 307,648 controls). Summary-level data for NAFLD were available from a GWAS meta-analysis (8434 cases and 770,180 controls), and data for 12 NAFLD-related features from corresponding published GWASs. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis was employed as the primary statistical method. Bidirectional MR and CAUSE analysis were conducted to avoid reverse causality and false positive findings. In univariable MR analyses, we found evidence to support a causal effect of genetically predicted sleep apnea on NAFLD (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.18-1.91) and HDL-C (β = -0.045, 95% CI = -0.090 to -0.001). In reverse MR, genetically predicted serum TG was associated with an increased risk of sleep apnea (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02-1.12), while genetically predicted HDL-C was associated with a decreased risk of sleep apnea (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.89-0.98). After adjusting body mass index or educational attainment, none of these causal associations were retained. However, CAUSE method and MR analyses focusing on lipoprotein subfractions supported a causal effect of sleep apnea on HDL-C and HDL subfractions. This MR study indicated that sleep apnea has no direct causal association with NAFLD, elevated liver enzymes and insulin resistance. Our results showed suggestive inverse associations of genetically predicted sleep apnea on HDL-C and HDL subfractions, indicating that both HDL-C levels and HDL function may be causally implicated in sleep apnea.",European journal of clinical investigation,2024,"Humans; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Body Mass Index; Causality; Sleep Apnea Syndromes; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,1

However, the causality between them still requires further investigation. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the causal effect of physical activity (PA) and sedentary time on the risk of IPF via two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Multiple genome-wide association study (GWAS) data involving individuals of European ancestry were analyzed. The datasets encompassed published UK Biobank data (91,105-377,234 participants) and IPF data (2018 cases and 373,064 controls) from FinnGen Biobank. The inverse variance weighting (IVW) method was the primary approach for our analysis. Sensitivity analyses were implemented with Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger regression, MR-PRESSO global test, and leave-one-out analysis. Genetically predicted self-reported PA was associated with lower IPF risk [OR = 0.27; 95% CI 0.09-0.82; P = 0.02]. No causal effects of accelerometry-based PA or sedentary time on the risk of IPF were observed. Our findings supported a protective relationship between self-reported PA and the risk for IPF.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension, causing cardiovascular events at higher risk compared with essential hypertension. However, the germline genetic contribution to the susceptibility of PA has not been well elucidated. We conducted a genome-wide association analysis of PA in the Japanese population and a cross-ancestry meta-analysis combined with UK Biobank and FinnGen cohorts (816 PA cases and 425 239 controls) to identify genetic variants that contribute to PA susceptibility. We also performed a comparative analysis for the risk of 42 previously established blood pressure-associated variants between PA and hypertension with the adjustment of blood pressure. In the Japanese genome-wide association study, we identified 10 loci that presented suggestive evidence for the association with the PA risk ( This study demonstrates the genome-wide evidence for a genetic predisposition to PA susceptibility in the cross-ancestry cohorts and its significant contribution to the genetic background of hypertension.

Previous epidemiological studies have found a bidirectional relationship between these two diseases; however, their causality remains largely unknown. We aim to examine the causal relationship between NAFLD and T2DM. The observational analysis included 2,099 participants from the SPECT-China study and 502,414 participants from the UK Biobank. Logistic regression and Cox regression models were used to examine the bidirectional association between NAFLD and T2DM. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to investigate the causal effects of the two diseases using summary statistics of genome-wide association studies from the UK Biobank for T2DM and the FinnGen study for NAFLD. During the follow-up, 129 T2DM cases and 263 NAFLD cases were observed in the SPECT-China study, and 30,274 T2DM cases and 4,896 NAFLD cases occurred in the UK Biobank cohort. Baseline NAFLD was associated with an increased risk of incident T2DM in both studies (SPECT-China: OR: 1.74 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12-2.70); UK Biobank: HR: 2.16 (95% CI: 1.82-2.56)), while baseline T2DM was associated with incident NAFLD in the UK Biobank study only (HR: 1.58).

FinnGen,38016486,Exploring the causal relationship between periodontitis and gut microbiome: Unveiling the oral-gut and gut-oral axes through bidirectional Mendelian randomization.,"This Mendelian randomization (MR) study was performed to explore the potential bidirectional causal relationship between the gut microbiome (GM) and periodontitis. We used genetic instruments from the genome-wide association study of European descent for periodontitis from the GeneLifestyle Interactions in Dental Endpoints (GLIDE) consortium (17,353 cases and 28,210 controls) and the FinnGen consortium (4434 cases and 259,234 controls) to investigate the causal relationship with GM (the MiBioGen consortium, 18,340 samples), and vice versa. Several MR techniques, which include inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode and weighted mode approaches, were employed to investigate the causal relationship between the exposures and the outcomes. Cochran's Q-test was performed to detect heterogeneity. The MR-Egger regression intercept and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier test (MR-PRESSO) were conducted to test potential horizontal pleiotropy. Leave-one-out sensitivity analyses were used to assess the stabilities of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Finally, the IVW results from the two databases were analysed using meta-analysis. We confirmed three potential causal relationships between GM taxa and periodontitis at the genus level. Among them, the genera Alistipes and Holdemanella were genetically associated with an increased risk of periodontitis. In reverse, periodontitis may lead to a decreased abundance of the genus Ruminococcaceae UCG014. The demonstration of a causal link between GM and periodontitis provides compelling evidence, highlighting the interconnectivity and interdependence of the gut-oral and oral-gut axes.",Journal of clinical periodontology,2024,Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Causality; Periodontitis,False,6
FinnGen,37537264,A FinnGen pilot clinical recall study for Alzheimer's disease.,"Successful development of novel therapies requires that clinical trials are conducted in patient cohorts with the highest benefit-to-risk ratio. Population-based biobanks with comprehensive health and genetic data from large numbers of individuals hold promise to facilitate identification of trial participants, particularly when interventions need to start while symptoms are still mild, such as for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study describes a process for clinical recall studies from FinnGen. We demonstrate the feasibility to systematically ascertain customized clinical data from FinnGen participants with ICD10 diagnosis of AD or mild cognitive disorder (MCD) in a single-center cross-sectional study testing blood-based biomarkers and cognitive functioning in-person, computer-based and remote. As a result, 19% (27/140) of a pre-specified FinnGen subcohort were successfully recalled and completed the study. Hospital records largely validated registry entries. For 8/12 MCD patients, other reasons than AD were identified as underlying diagnosis. Cognitive measures correlated across platforms, with highest consistencies for dementia screening (r = 0.818) and semantic fluency (r = 0.764), respectively, for in-person versus telephone-administered tests. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (p < 0.002) and phosphorylated-tau 181 (pTau-181) (p < 0.020) most reliably differentiated AD from MCD participants.

To this aim, we performed a two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to determine whether these associations were causal. Data on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to statin medication were obtained from the FinnGen study, and data for VTE, PE and DVT of lower extremities (LEDVT) were from the UK Biobank study, respectively. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the principal analysis of MR, and sensitivity analysis was performed to detect horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity. MR estimates showed an inverse causal association between statin medication and the risk of VTE (odds ratio [OR]: 0.999, 95% CI: 0.998-1.000, P = 0.004), PE (OR: 0.999, 95% CI: 0.999-1.000, P = 0.011) and LEDVT (OR: 0.999, 95% CI: 0.999-1.000, P = 0.008). Our findings provide direct evidence that statins might decrease the risk of VTE, PE and LEDVT in agreement with observational studies.

FinnGen,37275908,The genetically predicted causal relationship of inflammatory bowel disease with bone mineral density and osteoporosis: evidence from two-sample Mendelian randomization.,"Many existing studies indicated that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), tend to have the risk of low total body bone mineral density (BMD), and are more likely to have osteoporosis (OS). To determine the causal relationship between IBD and bone metabolic disorders, we herein performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis (TSMR) using publicly available summary statistics. Summary statistics of total body BMD, OS and IBD were downloaded from the Open Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), FinnGen consortium and International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC). The European and East Asian populations have consisted in this Mendelian Randomization (MR) work. A range of quality control procedures were taken to select eligible instrument SNPs closely associated with total body BMD, OS and IBD. To make the conclusions more reliable, we applied five robust analytical methods, among which the inverse variance weighting (IVW) method acted as the major method. Besides, heterogeneity, pleiotropy and sensitivity were evaluated. In the European population, the genetic association of UC on total body BMD (OR=0.97, 95%CI=0.96,0.99, P<0.001) and overall IBD on total body BMD (OR=0.98, 95%CI=0.97,1.00, P=0.013) were significant, while the effect of CD on total body BMD was not significant enough (OR=0.99, 95%CI=0.98,1.00, P=0.085). All of UC, CD and overall IBD can be the genetic risk factor of having OS with pathological fracture (UC: OR=1.13, 95%CI=1.02,1.26, P=0.024, CD: OR=1.14, 95%CI=1.05,1.25, P=0.003, overall IBD: OR=1.13, 95%CI=1.02,1.24, P=0.015). In East Asian groups, only CD had a causal relationship with OS (OR=1.04, 95% CI=1.01,1.07, P=0.019).

FinnGen,37148705,Causal relationship between Gut Microbiota and Obstructive sleep apnea.,"Although observational studies have identified relations between gut microbiota and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), their causal links remain elusive. Hence, we aimed to investigate this causal relation using the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. Summary-level gut microbiota data were acquired using the maximum available genome-wide association study (GWAS) from the MiBioGen consortium while obtaining summary-level OSA data using publicly available GWAS from the FinnGen Consortium. A two-sample MR analysis was used for assessing gut microbiota and OSA causal effect, using the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) approach as the primary analysis method. The results were further examined for pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Moreover, the reverse MR analysis did not find a causal relationship. Four gut microbiota were found to have nominally significant association to OSA according to the IVW method. Among them, the family Peptostreptococcaceae (OR = 1.171, 95% CI: 1.027-1.334) and genus Coprococcus3 (OR = 1.163, 95% CI: 1.007-1.343), these two florae that may increase the risk of OSA. Family Acidaminococcaceae (OR = 0.843, 95% CI: 0.729-0.975) and genus Blautia (OR = 0.830, 95% CI: 0.708-0.972) may have an ameliorative effect on OSA.

FinnGen,37746910,Cigarette smoking and thyroid cancer risk: A Mendelian randomization study.,"The association between cigarette smoking and thyroid cancer has been reported in prospective cohort studies, but the relationship remains controversial. To investigate this potential correlation further, we employed Mendelian randomization methodology to evaluate the causative impact of smoking on thyroid cancer incidence. From the genome-wide association study and Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine use, we obtained genetic variants associated with smoking initiation and cigarettes per day (1.2 million individuals). We also extracted genetic variants associated with past tobacco smoking from the UK Biobank (424,960 individuals). Thyroid cancer outcomes were selected from the FinnGen GWAS (989 thyroid cancer cases and 217,803 control cases). Sensitivity analyses employing various approaches such as weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) have been executed, as well as leave-one-out analysis to identify pleiotropy. Using the IVW approach, we did not find evidence that any of the three smoking phenotypes were related to thyroid cancer (smoking initiation: odds ratio (OR) = 1.56, p = 0.61; cigarettes per day: OR = 0.85, p = 0.51; past tobacco smoking: OR = 0.80, p = 0.78). The heterogeneity (p > 0.05) and pleiotropy (p > 0.05) testing provided confirmatory evidence for the validity of our MR estimates.

Here we performed a mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate whether this association is causal. Forty-four independent genetic variants strongly associated with tea intake were identified from a large genome-wide association study, including 448 060 individuals of the UK Biobank. We additionally obtained genome-wide association study summary statistics for kidney stones from the FinnGen consortium (5985 cases and 253 943 controls) and UK Biobank (6536 cases and 388 508 controls). Random-effect inverse variance weighted regression was used to evaluate causal estimates. The random-effect inverse variance weighted estimates based on the FinnGen consortium and UK Biobank were meta-analyzed using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Other MR methods, including MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier, were also performed to test the robustness of our results. In a combined sample of 12 521 cases and 642 451 controls, the inverse variance weighted analysis indicated that genetically predicted tea intake was causally associated with a decreased risk of kidney stones (odds ratio = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.34-0.66; P < 0.001). This association was consistent in other MR methods.

Mendelian randomization (MR) was used in the current study to assess the bidirectional causation between RA and hypothyroidism. We gathered summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of RA and hypothyroidism in people of European descent. Then, using data from the FinnGen consortium, we replicated our findings. Three approaches were employed to assess the causal link between RA and hypothyroidism: MR-Egger, weighted median (WM), and inverse variance weighted (IVW). The pleiotropy and heterogeneity were examined using a variety of techniques, including the MR-Egger intercept, the MR-PRESSO approach, the leave-one-out method, and the Cochran's Q test. The study looked at a bidirectional incidental relationship between RA and hypothyroidism. The risk of hypothyroidism increased with RA (IVW odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18-1.39,  The present study established a bidirectional causal link between RA and hypothyroidism.

To assess this potential relationship, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using independent genetic variants for UA levels from a published genome-wide association study (GWAS). Summary statistics for instrument-outcome associations from FinnGen database for AA and AD. Various sensitivity analyses were performed using different MR methods including random effects inverse variance weighting, fix effects inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger, weighted median/mode, and the contamination mixture method. Genetically predicted UA levels was associated with a higher AA risk (odds ratio (OR), 1.223; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.058-1.388; p = 0.017) in a simple size of 209,366 individuals. No association was found between uric acid levels and the risk of AD (OR,0.812; 95 % CI, 0.423-1.200; p = 0.293). Our study suggests a significant and robust causal association between UA levels and risk of AA but did not support such a relationship between UA levels and AD risk, which might be interpreted with caution and further confirmed. These findings support a clinically relevant causal effect of serum urate levels on the risk of AA.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2024,Humans; Aortic Aneurysm; Aortic Dissection; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Uric Acid,False,8

This study aims to explore the influence of gut microbiota on subtypes of UC and CD, offering novel insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of UC and CD.Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to examine the causal relationship between subtypes of UC and CD and gut microbiota composition. Gut microbiota data were sourced from the International Consortium MiBioGen, while UC and CD data were obtained from FINNGEN. Eligible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental variables. Multiple analytical approaches such as inverse variance-weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-RAPS were utilized.

FinnGen,38031296,Effect of Glucosamine on Intraocular Pressure and Risk of Developing Glaucoma.,"Glucosamine supplementation is common but can be associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and could contribute to the pathogenesis of glaucoma. It may be prudent for ophthalmologists to elicit any history of glucosamine use from their patients and advise them accordingly. Further studies on the role of glucosamine in glaucoma are warranted. The most frequently recommended slow-acting medication for osteoarthritis symptoms is glucosamine, although its effectiveness is questionable. Widely used glucosamine sulfate supplements may increase IOP. In the current study, we analyzed online databases such as UK Biobank, MedWatch, and FinnGen to evaluate the relationship between glucosamine and IOP and glaucoma. We included budesonide and fluticasone in the analysis for comparison since these drugs are associated with increased IOP. In UK Biobank subjects, glucosamine use was associated with increased corneal compensated IOP ( P =0.002, 2-tailed t test). This was also true in subjects without glaucoma ( P =0.002, 2-tailed t test). However, no significant association between glucosamine and IOP was detected in subjects with a diagnosis of glaucoma. In MedWatch, 0.21% of subjects taking glucosamine reported glaucoma, 0.29% of subjects using budesonide reported glaucoma, and 0.22% of subjects using fluticasone reported glaucoma. In contrast, 0.08% of subjects using any other drug reported glaucoma. This variability is significant ( P <0.001, 2-tailed Fisher exact test). Data from FinnGen on the risk of primary open angle glaucoma or glaucoma in subjects using glucosamine before the diagnosis of the disease revealed a significantly increased risk for both primary open angle glaucoma (hazard ratio: 2.35) and glaucoma (hazard ratio: 1.95).

We obtained strong (P <5x10-8), independent (r2<0.001) genetic predictors of fatty acids from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in a random subset of 114 999 UK Biobank participants. We applied these genetic predictors to the Cardiogram IHD GWAS (cases = 60 801, controls = 123 504) and to the Finngen consortium GWAS (cases = 31 640, controls = 187 152) for replication and to the UK Biobank for sex-specific IHD and for lifespan based on parental attained age (fathers = 415 311, mothers = 412 937). We used sensitivity analysis and assessed sex differences where applicable. PUFAs were associated with IHD [odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.44] and lifespan in men (-0.76 years, 95% CI -1.34 to -0.17) but not women (0.20, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.70). Findings were similar for omega-6 fatty acids and linoleic acid. Independent associations of SFAs, mono-unsaturated fatty acids or omega-3 fatty acids with IHD overall or lifespan in men and women were limited. PUFAs, via specific subspecies, may contribute to disparities in lifespan by sex. Sex-specific dietary advice might be a start towards personalized public health and addressing inequities.",International journal of epidemiology,2023,"Humans; Female; Male; Fatty Acids; Longevity; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Myocardial Ischemia; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Coronary Artery Disease; Fatty Acids, Omega-3",False,0
FinnGen,37467250,"Physical activity, sedentary behavior and pancreatitis risk: Mendelian randomization study.","Although observational studies have shown that physical activity is a protective factor for acute pancreatitis, the causal associations between PA/ sedentary behavior and acute pancreatitis (AP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP) remain unclear. We used Mendelian randomization as a strategy to assess the causalities between exposures and outcomes by simulating randomized experiments with genetic variation. The collected genetic variants data of physical activity were from UK Biobank, the data on sedentary behavior were also from UK Biobank, and both of them could be found in the GWAS catalog, and the data on AP and CP were from FinnGen. There were three physical activity related activity patterns (moderate to vigorous physical activity [MVPA], accelerometer-based physical activity with average acceleration, [AccAve] and accelerometer-based physical activity with accelerations >425 milli-gravities, [Acc425]) and three sedentary behavior-related lifestyle patterns (Leisure screen time [LST], Sedentary commuting, Sedentary behavior at work). We used inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median and MR-Egger for the analysis of Mendelian randomization, followed by sensitivity tests with the Cochran Q test, MR-Egger intercepts analysis and MR-PRESSO. A causal relationship was found between LST and acute pancreatitis based on IVW analysis (odds ratios [OR] = 1.38, corresponding 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.16-1.64, p = 0.0002) and there were no causal relationships between physical activity/sedentary behavior and chronic pancreatitis.

However, whether these associations are all causal remains unestablished. This study aimed to assess the potential causal associations of apolipoprotein B and coffee intake with the risk of gastric, colorectal, and esophageal cancers using Mendelian randomization analysis. In this study, we utilized a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to access the causal effects of coffee intake and apolipoprotein B on gastric, colorectal, and esophageal cancers. The summary statistics of coffee intake (n = 428,860) and apolipoprotein B (n = 439,214) were obtained from the UK Biobank. In addition, the summary statistics of gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and esophageal cancer were obtained from the FinnGen biobank (n = 218,792). Inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode were applied to examine the causal relationship between coffee intake, apolipoprotein B and gastric, colorectal, and esophageal cancers. MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran's Q test, and leave-one-out analysis were performed to evaluate possible heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Steiger filtering and bidirectional mendelian randomization analysis were performed to evaluate the possible reverse causality. The result of the inverse variance weighted method indicated that apolipoprotein B levels were significantly associated with a higher risk of gastric cancer (OR = 1.392, 95% CI 1.027-1.889, P = 0.0333) and colorectal cancer (OR = 1.188, 95% CI 1.001-1.411, P = 0.0491). Furthermore, multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis also revealed a positive association between apolipoprotein B levels and colorectal cancer risk, but the effect of apolipoprotein B on gastric cancer risk disappeared after adjustment of coffee intake, body mass index or lipid-related traits. However, we did not discover any conclusive evidence linking coffee intake to gastric, colorectal, or esophageal cancers. This study suggested a causal association between genetically increased apolipoprotein B levels and higher risk of colorectal cancer.

FinnGen,38274231,Association between human blood metabolome and the risk of delirium: a Mendelian Randomization study.,"Delirium significantly contributes to both mortality and morbidity among hospitalized older adults. Furthermore, delirium leads to escalated healthcare expenditures, extended hospital stays, and enduring cognitive deterioration, all of which are acknowledged detrimental outcomes. Nonetheless, the current strategies for predicting and managing delirium remain constrained. Our aim was to employ Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the potential causal relationship between metabolites and delirium, as well as to identify potential therapeutic targets. We identified 129 distinct blood metabolites from three genome-wide association studies (GWASs) conducted on the metabolome, involving a total of 147,827 participants of European descent. Genetic information pertaining to delirium was sourced from the ninth iteration of the Finngen Biobank, encompassing 359,699 individuals of Finnish ancestry. We conducted MR analyses to evaluate the connections between blood metabolites and delirium. Additionally, we extended our analysis to encompass the entire phenome using MR, aiming to uncover potential on-target consequences resulting from metabolite interventions. In our investigation, we discovered three metabolites serving as causal mediators in the context of delirium: clinical low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (odds ratio [OR]: 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-1.73,  (1) Limited representation of the complete blood metabolome, (2) reliance on the PheCode system based on hospital diagnoses may underrepresent conditions with infrequent hospital admissions, and (3) limited to European ancestry. The genetic prediction of heightened O-methylascorbate levels seems to correspond to a diminished risk of delirium, in contrast to the association of elevated clinical LDL-C and sphingomyelin levels with an amplified risk. A comprehensive analysis of side-effect profiles has been undertaken to facilitate the prioritization of drug targets. Notably, O-methylascorbate emerges as a potentially auspicious target for mitigating and treating delirium, offering the advantage of lacking predicted adverse side effects.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023,"Humans; Aged; Cholesterol, LDL; Risk Factors; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Sphingomyelins; Delirium",False,2
FinnGen,36773317,Increasing serum iron levels and their role in the risk of infectious diseases: a Mendelian randomization approach.,"Increased iron stores have been associated with elevated risks of different infectious diseases, suggesting that iron supplementation may increase the risk of infections. However, these associations may be biased by confounding or reverse causation. This is important, since up to 19% of the population takes iron supplementation. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to bypass these biases and estimate the causal effect of iron on infections. As instrumental variables, we used genetic variants associated with iron biomarkers in two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of European ancestry participants. For outcomes, we used GWAS results from the UK Biobank, FinnGen, the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative or 23andMe, for seven infection phenotypes: 'any infections', combined, COVID-19 hospitalization, candidiasis, pneumonia, sepsis, skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) and urinary tract infection (UTI). Most of our analyses showed increasing iron (measured by its biomarkers) was associated with only modest changes in the odds of infectious outcomes, with all 95% odds ratios confidence intervals within the 0.88 to 1.26 range. However, for the three predominantly bacterial infections (sepsis, SSTI, UTI), at least one analysis showed a nominally elevated risk with increased iron stores (P <0.05). Using MR, we did not observe an increase in risk of most infectious diseases with increases in iron stores. However for bacterial infections, higher iron stores may increase odds of infections. Hence, using genetic variation in iron pathways as a proxy for iron supplementation, iron supplements are likely safe on a population level, but we should continue the current practice of conservative iron supplementation during bacterial infections or in those at high risk of developing them.",International journal of epidemiology,2023,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; COVID-19; Iron; Biomarkers; Sepsis; Communicable Diseases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,7

Nevertheless, the causal associations and underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) statistics for COVID-19 and 28 genitourinary symptoms with consistent definitions were collected from the COVID-19 Host Genetic Initiative, FinnGen, and UK Biobanks. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were applied to explore the causal effects of COVID-19 on genitourinary symptoms by selecting single-nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables. Meta-analyses were conducted to evaluate the combined causal effect. Molecular pathways connecting COVID-19 and its associated disorders were evaluated by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and enrichment analyses to extract insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the connection.

However, the causal relationship between obesity and autoimmune diseases is unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to investigate the causal effects of obesity on 15 autoimmune diseases. MR analysis employed instrumental variables, specifically single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with obesity measures such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio. The study utilized UK Biobank and FinnGen data to estimate the causal relationship between obesity and autoimmune diseases. Genetically predicted BMI was associated with risk for five autoimmune diseases. The odds ratio per 1-SD increase in genetically predicted BMI, the OR was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.18-1.09; p &lt; 0.001) for asthma, 1.37 (95% CI, 1.24-1.51; p &lt; 0.001) for hypothyroidism, 1.52 (95% CI, 1.27-1.83; p &lt; 0.001) for psoriasis, 1.22 (95% CI, 1.06-1.40; p = 0.005) for rheumatoid arthritis, and 1.55 (95% CI, 1.32-1.83; p &lt; 0.001) for type 1 diabetes. However, after adjusting for genetic susceptibility to drinking and smoking, the correlation between BMI and rheumatoid arthritis was not statistically significant. Genetically predicted waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist and hip circumference were associated with 6, 6, and 1 autoimmune disease, respectively.

However, the reported results in previous studies are inconsistent, and randomized data are absent. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to study the causal effects of genetically determined blood pressure (BP) and genetic proxies for antihypertensive drug classes on the risk of IA and SAH. Genetic instruments and outcome data were obtained from independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or published data, which were exclusively restricted to European ancestry. Causal relationships were identified using inverse-variance weighted MR analyses and a series of statistical sensitivity analyses. The FinnGen consortium was used for repeated analysis to verify results obtained from the above GWAS. Two-sample MR analysis showed that genetically determined Systolic BP, Dystolic BP, and Pulse Pressure were related to a higher risk of IA and SAH. Based on identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence the effect of calcium channel blockers (CCB, 42 SNPs), beta-blockers (BB, 8 SNPs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI, 2 SNPs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB, 1 SNPs), and thiazides (5 SNPs), genetically determined effect of CCBs was associated with a higher risk of IA (OR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.03-1.10],  This MR analysis supports the role of elevated blood pressure in the occurrence of intracranial aneurysms and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

FinnGen,36806752,Mendelian randomization approach shows no causal effects of gestational age on epilepsy in offspring.,"Observational studies have suggested that gestational age was associated with the risk of epilepsy later in life. However, it remains unclear whether the association is of a causal nature. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to assess the causal effect of fetal gestational age on epilepsy. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics of gestational duration, early preterm birth, preterm birth, and postterm birth were from the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) Consortium. GWAS summary-level data on epilepsy were obtained from the International League Against Epilepsy Consortium (ILAEC) and FinnGen Consortium.

FinnGen,36521586,Mendelian randomization investigation highlights different roles of selenium status in mental disorders.,"Observational studies have suggested a relationship between selenium status and mental disorders (MDs). However, it remains unclear whether selenium status was causally associated with MDs. Thus, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics to investigate the causal effects of selenium levels on seven MDs, including schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD), anorexia nervosa (AN), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and panic disorder (PD). Strong genetic instruments of blood selenium (n = 9) and blood-toenail selenium (n = 12) were applied to the above seven MDs GWAS datasets from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, which were further replicated in the FinnGen Biobank. The inverse-variance weighted method was employed to calculate the causal effects. The results showed that genetically predicted blood selenium levels were associated with a decreased risk of schizophrenia (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.87-0.95) and AN (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77-0.97).

This study aims to explore the causal relationship between inflammatory cytokines and AS, RA, and PsA using Mendelian randomization (MR). We conducted a bidirectional two-sample MR analysis using genetic summary data from a publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) that included 41 genetic variations of inflammatory cytokines, as well as genetic variant data for AS, RA, and PsA from the FinnGen consortium. The main analysis method used was Inverse variance weighted (IVW) to investigate the causal relationship between exposure and outcome. Additionally, other methods such as MR Egger, weighted median (WM), simple mode, and weighted mode were employed to strengthen the final results. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to ensure the reliability of the findings. The results showed that macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) was associated with an increased risk of AS (OR = 1.163, 95 % CI = 1.016-1.33, p = 0.028).

This study investigated the causal relevance of component hypertensive indices on multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes using Mendelian randomization. Uncorrelated ( r2  < 0.001) genome-wide significant ( P  < 5 × 10 -8 ) single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with SBP, DBP and pulse pressure (PP) were selected as instrumental variables. Genetic association estimates for outcomes of preeclampsia or eclampsia, preterm birth, placental abruption and hemorrhage in early pregnancy were extracted from summary statistics of genome-wide association studies in the FinnGen cohort. Two-sample, inverse-variance weighted Mendelian randomization formed the primary analysis method. Odds ratios (OR) are presented per-10 mmHg higher genetically predicted hypertensive index. Higher genetically predicted SBP were associated with higher odds of preeclampsia or eclampsia [OR 1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68-1.96, P  = 5.45 × 10 -49 ], preterm birth (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.16, P  = 0.005) and placental abruption (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.68, P  = 0.016). Higher genetically-predicted DBP was associated with preeclampsia or eclampsia (OR 2.54, 95% CI 2.21-2.92, P  = 5.35 × 10 -40 ). Higher genetically predicted PP was associated with preeclampsia or eclampsia (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.47-1.92, P  = 1.9 × 10 -14 ) and preterm birth (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.30, P  = 0.002).

Further unclear is the association between TG levels and non-atherosclerotic diseases across organ systems. Here, we conducted a phenome-wide, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using inverse-variance weighted (IVW) regression to systematically infer the causal effects of plasma TG levels on 2600 disease traits in the European ancestry population of UK Biobank. For replication, we externally tested 221 nominally significant associations (p<0.05) in an independent cohort from FinnGen. To account for potential horizontal pleiotropy and the influence of invalid instrumental variables, we performed sensitivity analyses using MR-Egger regression, weighted median estimator, and MR-PRESSO.

Summary-level data for the associations of exposure-associated SNPs with kidney stones were obtained from the UK Biobank study (6536 cases and 388,508 controls) and the FinnGen consortium (9713 cases and 366,693 non-cases). MR methods were conducted, including inverse variance weighted method (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO. MR-Egger Regression Intercept and Cochran's Q test were used to assess the directional pleiotropy and heterogeneity. cALT-associated NAFLD did not exhibit an association with kidney stones in the Inverse variance weighted (IVW) methods, in both the FinnGen consortium (OR: 1.02, 95%CI: 0.94-1.11, p = 0.632) and the UKBB study (OR: 1.000, 95%CI: 0.998-1.002, p = 0.852).

IVW MR analysis also did not reveal a significant causal relationship between NAFLD and the risk of kidney stone for the other three NAFLD-related traits, including imaging-based, biopsy-confirmed NAFLD, and more stringent biopsy-confirmed NAFLD. The results remained consistent and robust in the sensitivity analysis.

In this study, we performed a summarized-level bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to shed light on the causal relationship between the two. Genetic instrumental-variables (IVs) associated with circulating cytokine/growth factor levels were derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 8,293 European individuals, whereas summary data for the AS were obtained from a FinnGen GWAS of 166,144 participants. We used the inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) method as the main analysis for causal inference. Furthermore, several sensitivity analyses (MR-Egger, weighted median, MR-PRESSO and Cochran's Q test) were utilized to examine the robustness of the results. Finally, reverse MR analysis was performed to assess reverse causality between AS and circulating cytokine/growth factor levels. After Bonferroni correction, circulating levels of Cutaneous T-cell attracting (CTACK) and Monocyte specific chemokine 3 (MCP-3) were positively associated with a higher risk of AS (odds ratio [OR]: 1.224, 95% confidence interval [95% Cl]: 1.022 ~ 1.468,  The present study supplies genetic evidence for the relationship between circulating cytokine levels and AS.

Nevertheless, the precise causal relationship between gut microbiota and thyroid function remains uncertain. In this two-sample Mendelian randomization study, we utilized summary data from a genome-wide association study of gut microbiota composition in 18,340 participants from 24 cohorts, as well as summary statistics on thyroid hormones and thyroid-stimulating hormone from the ThyroidOmics Consortium and summary statistics on hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism from the FinnGen R8 release. Five different methods, including inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode, were employed to examine the causal relationship between gut microbiota and thyroid function. Reverse Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted for taxa identified as having a causal relationship with thyroid function in the Mendelian randomization analysis. To assess the robustness of the results, sensitivity analyses were conducted employing Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO global test, and leave-one-out analysis. Through MR analysis of 211 microbial taxa and 4 phenotypes, we identified a total of 34 gut microbiota taxa that were associated with the outcomes.

FinnGen,37640577,Genetically Proxied Sarcopenia-Related Muscle Traits and Depression: Evidence from the FinnGen Cohort.,"Sarcopenia and depression are common and often coexist in the elderly. This study aims to determine the impact of sarcopenia-related muscle traits on depression. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was performed on the summary-level data from the FinnGen cohort to estimate the causal association of appendicular lean mass (ALM), walking pace, or low hand grip strength with depression. Additionally, multivariable MR (MVMR) was performed to assess the dependence of each muscle trait in the causality and adjust the effect of body mass index (BMI). Supplementary backward MR analyses were performed to estimate the effect of depression on sarcopenia-related muscle traits. Univariable MR analyses demonstrated that there were causal associations of ALM (odds ratio [OR]: 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-0.99), walking pace (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.32-0.88), and low hand grip strength (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.05-1.38) with depression. MVMR analyses showed that ALM was the only trait that had a significant causal relationship with depression (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85-0.98) after accounting for the other two muscle traits. Moreover, the independent association of ALM with depression remained (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85-0.99) after being adjusted by BMI. The backward MR analyses showed no causal associations of depression with any sarcopenia-related muscle traits. Low muscle mass independently increases the risk of depression. This study determined the muscle-related risk factors of depression, which may help establish the causality between sarcopenia and depression and provide evidence-based recommendations for improving mental health in the elderly.",The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,2024,"Aged; Humans; Body Mass Index; Depression; Hand Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Sarcopenia; Mendelian Randomization Analysis",False,8
FinnGen,37877466,Genome-wide association study meta-analysis supports association between MUC1 and ectopic pregnancy.,"Can we identify genetic variants associated with ectopic pregnancy by undertaking the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) leveraging two large-scale biobank initiatives? We identified two novel genome-wide significant associations with ectopic pregnancy, highlighting MUC1 (mucin 1) as the most plausible affected gene. Ectopic pregnancy is an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite being a common early pregnancy complication, the genetic predisposition to this condition remains understudied and no large scale genetic studies have been performed so far. A GWAS meta-analysis including 7070 women with ectopic pregnancy and 248 810 controls from Estonian Biobank and the FinnGen study. We identified ectopic pregnancy cases from national registers by ICD (International Classification of Disease) codes (ICD-10 O00), and all remaining women were considered controls. We carried out standard GWAS meta-analysis and additionally annotated GWAS signals, analysed co-localization with quantitative trait loci, estimated genetic correlations and identified associated phenotypes to characterize the genetic signals, as well as to analyse the genetic and phenotypic relationships with the condition. We identified two genome-wide significant loci on chromosomes 1 (rs4971091, P = 5.32×10-9) and 10 (rs11598956, P = 2.41×10-8) potentially associated with ectopic pregnancy. Follow-up analyses propose MUC1, which codes for an epithelial glycoprotein with an important role in barrier function, as the most likely candidate gene for the association on chromosome 1. We also characterize the phenotypic and genetic correlations with other phenotypes, identifying a genetic correlation with smoking and diseases of the (genito)urinary and gastrointestinal system, and phenotypic correlations with various reproductive health diagnoses, reflecting the previously known epidemiological associations. The GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics are available from the GWAS Catalogue (GCST90272883). The main limitation is that the findings are based on European-based ancestry populations, with limited data on other populations, and we only captured maternal genomes. Additionally, further larger meta-analysis or independent studies are needed to validate these findings. This study encourages the use of large-scale genetic datasets to unravel genetic factors linked to ectopic pregnancy, which is difficult to study in experimental settings. Increased sample size might bring additional genetic factors associating with ectopic pregnancy and inform its heritability. Altogether, our results provide more insight into the biology of ectopic pregnancy and, accordingly, the biological processes governing embryo implantation.

However, the exact causal relationship between AD and both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains controversial. This study aimed to explore the causal association between AD and diabetes by Mendelian Randomization (MR) approaches. Public genetic summary data for AD was obtained from EAGLE study. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of diabetes were retrieved from four genome-wide association studies that had been performed in European populations. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) in MR analysis was used as the primary means of causality estimation. Several complementary analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed to calculate MR estimates and to enhance the causal inference, respectively. The R package 'TwoSampleMR' was used for analysis. Genetically predicted AD led to a higher risk of T1D (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.05, 1.34; P = 0.006) and T2D (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02, 1.11; P = 0.003) based on random-effect IVW method. The complementary analyses provided similar positive results. Cochran's Q test and I Genetically predicted AD is a risk factor for both T1D and T2D.

Observational studies have shown a relationship between thyroid and breast cancers. Nevertheless, many confounders predispose the results to interference. Accordingly, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the causal association between thyroid and breast cancers. We acquired breast cancer data from the UK Biobank (13,879 breast cancer cases and 198,523 controls) and the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC; 122,977 breast cancer cases and 105,974 controls), and thyroid cancer data from FinnGen Biobank (989 thyroid cancer and 217,803 controls). Then, the multiplicative random effects inverse variance weighting (IVW), weight median (WM), and MR Egger methods were executed for MR analysis. Overall, IVW showed a causal effect of breast cancer on thyroid cancer using the BCAC dataset (odds ratio [OR] = 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.036-1.322; P = 0.011), and this relationship was also supported by the UK Biobank dataset (OR = 23.899; 95% CI = 2.331-245.003; P = 0.007), which showed that breast cancer patients were more likely to be diagnosed with thyroid cancer. On the whole, the reverse MR analysis did not show a causal effect of breast cancer on thyroid cancer. However, IVW showed a causal effect of thyroid cancer on estrogen receptor -negative breast cancer using the BCAC dataset (OR = 1.019; 95% CI = 1.001-1.038; P = 0.043), which suggested that people with thyroid cancer were more likely to develop breast cancer.

FinnGen,37984746,Roles of Human Gut Microbiota in Liver Cirrhosis Risk: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that alterations in gut microbiota composition and diversity are associated with liver cirrhosis. But whether gut microbiota promotes or hampers the genesis and development of liver cirrhosis remains vague. This study aimed to establish a causal relationship between gut microbiota and the development of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. To achieve this, we employed a 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis utilizing genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. This approach enabled us to assess the potential impact of gut microbiota on liver cirrhosis. The independent genetic instruments of gut microbiota were obtained from the MiBioGen (up to 18,340 participants), which is a large-scale genome-wide genotype and 16S fecal microbiome dataset. Cirrhosis data were derived from the FinnGen biobank analysis, which included 214,403 individuals of European ancestry (811 patients and 213,592 controls). To assess the causal relationship between gut microbiota and cirrhosis, we applied 4 different methods of MR analysis: the inverse-variance weighted method (IVW), the MR-Egger regression, the weighted median analysis (WME), and the weighted mode. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. Results of MR analyses provided evidence of a causal association between 4 microbiota features and cirrhosis, including 2 family [Lachnosiraceae: odds ratio (OR): 1.82626178; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05208209, 3.17012532; P = 0.0323194; Lactobacillaceae : OR: 0.62897502; 95% CI: 0.42513162, 0.93055788; P = 0.02033345] and 2 genus [Butyricicoccus: OR: 0.41432215; 95% CI: 0.22716865, 0.75566257; P = 0.0040564; Lactobacillus: OR: 0.6663767; 95% CI: 0.45679511, 0.97211616; P = 0.03513627].

FinnGen,38260127,Controversial causal association between IGF family members and osteoporosis: a Mendelian randomization study between UK and FinnGen biobanks.,"Osteoporosis, a prevalent skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength, is closely linked to the IGF system, crucial for skeletal metabolism. However, the precise nature of this relationship remains elusive. In this study, we employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to unravel the associations between genetically predicted serum IGF system member levels and osteoporosis. A two-sample MR approach was employed to investigate these causal associations based on two individual datasets. Predictions of 14 serum levels of IGF system members were made using 11,036,163 relevant Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within a cohort of 4,301 individuals of European descent. Genetic association estimates for osteoporosis were derived from two publicly available GWAS consortia: the Finnish consortium from the FinnGen biobank, comprising 212,778 individuals of Finnish descent (3,203 cases and 209,575 controls), and the UK consortium from the UK Biobank, including 337,159 individuals of European descent (5,266 cases and 331,893 controls). According to the UK dataset, IGF-1 levels were associated with a reduced risk of osteoporosis, as indicated by the weighted median method (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.998, 95% CI = 0.997-1.000, P = 0.032). Additionally, higher levels of IGFBP-3 were linked to a decreased risk of osteoporosis using the Inverse-Variance Weighted (IVW) method (OR = 0.999, 95% CI = 0.998-1.000, P = 0.019), and CTGF levels exhibited a negative association with osteoporosis, as determined by the weighted median method (OR = 0.998, 95% CI = 0.996-0.999, P = 0.004). In the FinnGen dataset, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were not identified to be associated with osteoporosis. While, IGF-LR1 levels displayed a negative association with osteoporosis, according to the MR-Egger method (OR = 0.886, 95% CI = 0.795-0.987, P = 0.036), while CYR61 was linked to an increased risk of osteoporosis based on both the weighted median and IVW methods (OR = 1.154, 95% CI = 1.009-1.319, P = 0.037, and OR = 1.115, 95% CI = 1.022-1.215, P = 0.014, respectively). This study provides compelling evidence that certain IGF family members play a role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis between different datasets, indicating population specific causal effects between IGF family and osteoporosis. Although the results from both datasets demonstrated that IGF family involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, but the responding key molecules might be various among different population.

FinnGen,37624788,Univariable and multivariable mendelian randomization study revealed the modifiable risk factors of urolithiasis.,"Urolithiasis is a common urological disease with increasing incidence worldwide, and preventing its risk poses significant challenges. Here, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to genetically assess the causal nature of multifaceted risk factors on urolithiasis. 17 potential risk factors associated with urolithiasis were collected from recently published observational studies, which can be categorized basically into lifestyle factors and circulating biomarkers. The instrumental variables of risk factors were selected from large-scale genome-wide association studies (N ≤ 607,291). Summary-level data on urolithiasis were obtained from UK Biobank (UKB) (3,625 cases and 459,308 noncases) and the FinnGen consortium (5,347 cases and 213,445 noncases). The univariable and multivariable MR analyses were applied to evaluate the causal, independent effect of these potential risk factors upon urolithiasis. Effects from the two consortia were combined by the meta-analysis methods. Higher genetically predicted sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG, OR, 0.708; 95% CI, 0.555 to 0.903), estradiol (OR, 0.179; 95% CI, 0.042 to 0.751), tea intake (OR, 0.550; 95% CI, 0.345 to 0.878), alcoholic drinks per week (OR, 0.992; 95% CI, 0.987 to 0.997), and some physical activity (e.g., swimming, cycling, keeping fit, and bowling, OR, 0.054; 95% CI, 0.008 to 0.363) were significantly associated with a lower risk of urolithiasis. In the Multivariate Mendelian Randomization (MVMR) analyses, the significant causal associations between estradiol, SHBG, tea intake, and alcoholic drinks per week with urolithiasis were robust even after adjusting for potential confounding variables. However, the previously observed causal association between other exercises and urolithiasis was no longer significant after adjusting for these factors. The univariable and multivariable MR findings highlight the independent and significant roles of estradiol, SHBG, tea intake, and alcoholic drinks per week in the development of urolithiasis, which might provide a deeper insight into urolithiasis risk factors and supply potential preventative strategies.",PloS one,2023,Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Risk Factors; Urolithiasis; Estradiol; Swimming; Tea,False,7

FinnGen,37667670,Genetically predicted body mass index and maternal outcomes of pregnancy: A two-sample Mendelian randomisation study.,"Observational studies have described associations between obesity and adverse outcomes of pregnancy but observational results are liable to influence by residual confounding. Mendelian randomisation (MR) leverages the 'natural' genetic randomisation to risk of an exposure occurring at allele assortment and conception. Similar to randomisation in a clinical trial, this limits the potential for the influence of confounding. A two-sample MR study. Summary statistics from published genome wide association studies (GWAS) in European ancestry populations. Instrumental variants for body mass index (BMI) were obtained from a study on 434 794 females. Inverse-variance weighted MR was used to assess the association between BMI and all outcomes. Sensitivity analyses with weighted median and MR-Egger were also performed. Female-specific genetic association estimates for outcomes were extracted from the sixth round of analysis of the FINNGEN cohort data. Higher genetically predicted BMI was associated with higher risk of pre-eclampsia (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.46-1.94, P = 8.74 × 10 Higher genetically predicted BMI is associated with marked increase in risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and polyhydramnios.

Our aim was to investigate the causal effect of vitamin D on hyperemesis gravidarum using the two-sample Mendelian randomization method. Independent single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly associated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels served as instrumental variables. The corresponding effect estimates for hyperemesis gravidarum were obtained from the Finngen Biobank. For Mendelian randomization analysis, inverse variance weighting was used as the primary method. We also used weighted median, MR-Egger regression, simple mode, and weighted mode as complementary methods to inverse variance weighting. The MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran's Q test, and ""leave-one-out"" sensitivity analysis were performed to assess the horizontal pleiotropy, heterogeneity, and stability of the causal association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and hyperemesis gravidarum. We found that an increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was associated with a lower risk of hyperemesis gravidarum [odds ratio (OR): 0.568, 95 % CI: 0.403-0.800, p = 0.001]. The result demonstrates the causal relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and the risk of hyperemesis gravidarum in the European population.

FinnGen,37212139,Risk of Midlife Stroke After Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes: The FinnGen Study.,"Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO) contribute to higher risk of maternal cerebrovascular disease, but longitudinal data that include APO and stroke timing are lacking. We hypothesized that APO are associated with younger age at first stroke, with a stronger relationship in those with >1 pregnancy with APO. We analyzed longitudinal Finnish nationwide health registry data from the FinnGen Study. We included women who gave birth after 1969 when the hospital discharge registry was established. We defined APO as a pregnancy affected by gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, preterm birth, small for gestational age infant, or placental abruption. We defined stroke as first hospital admission for ischemic stroke or nontraumatic intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage, excluding stroke during pregnancy or within 1 year postpartum. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable-adjusted Cox and generalized linear models to assess the relationship between APO and future stroke. We included 144 306 women with a total of 316 789 births in the analysis sample, of whom 17.9% had at least 1 pregnancy with an APO and 2.9% experienced an APO in ≥2 pregnancies. Women with APO had more comorbidities including obesity, hypertension, heart disease, and migraine. Median age at first stroke was 58.3 years in those with no APO, 54.8 years in those with 1 APO, and 51.6 years in those with recurrent APO. In models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and stroke risk factors, risk of stroke was greater in women with 1 APO (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.4]) and recurrent APO (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.2-1.7]) compared with those with no APO. Women with recurrent APO had more than twice the stroke risk before age 45 (adjusted odds ratio, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.5-3.1]) compared with those without APO.

FinnGen,37791980,Genome-Wide Association and Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Analyses of Plasma Ghrelin and Gastrointestinal Cancer Risk.,"Observational studies have suggested that the gut hormone ghrelin is an early marker of future risk of developing gastrointestinal cancer. However, whether ghrelin is a causal risk factor remains unclear. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of plasma ghrelin and used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the possible causal association between ghrelin and gastrointestinal cancer risk. Genetic variants associated with plasma ghrelin were identified in a GWAS comprising 10,742 Swedish adults in the discovery (N = 6,259) and replication (N = 4,483) cohorts. The association between ghrelin and gastrointestinal cancer was examined through a two-sample MR analysis using the identified genetic variants as instruments and GWAS data from the UK Biobank, FinnGen, and a colorectal cancer consortium. GWAS found associations between multiple genetic variants within ±200 kb of the GHRL gene and plasma ghrelin. A two-sample MR analysis revealed that genetically predicted higher plasma ghrelin levels were associated with a lower risk of gastrointestinal cancer in UK Biobank and in a meta-analysis of the UK Biobank and FinnGen studies. The combined OR per approximate doubling of genetically predicted plasma ghrelin was 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.85-0.99; P = 0.02). Colocalization analysis revealed limited evidence of shared causal variants for plasma ghrelin and gastrointestinal cancer at the GHRL locus (posterior probability H4 = 24.5%); however, this analysis was likely underpowered. Our study provides evidence in support of a possible causal association between higher plasma ghrelin levels and a reduced risk of gastrointestinal cancer. Elevated plasma ghrelin levels might reduce the risk of gastrointestinal cancer.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",2023,"Adult; Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Ghrelin; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,7
FinnGen,36717884,Genetic association and causal inference between lung function and venous thromboembolism.,"Previous studies have indicated that lower lung function is related to a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, causal inferences may be affected by confounders, coheritability or reverse causality. We aimed to explore the causal association between lung function and VTE. Summary data from public genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for lung function and VTE were obtained from published meta-analysis studies and the FinnGen consortium, respectively. Independent genetic variables significantly related to exposure were filtered as proxy instruments. We adopted linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to infer the genetic backgrounds and causal associations between different lung functions and VTE events. LDSC showed a genetic correlation between forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (rg = - 0.189, P = 0.005). In univariate MR (UVMR), there was suggestive evidence for causal associations of genetically predicted force vital capacity (FVC) with DVT (odds ratio (OR) 0.774; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.641-0.934) via forwards analysis and genetically predicted pulmonary embolism (PE) with FVC (OR 0.989; 95% CI 0.979-0.999) via reverse analysis. Multivariate MR (MVMR) analyses of lung function-specific SNPs suggested no significant direct effects of lung function on VTE, and vice versa. Of note is the borderline causal effect of PE on FEV1 (OR 0.921; 95% CI 0.848-1.000). Our findings identified a coheritability of FEV1 (significant) and FVC (suggestive) with DVT. There was no convincing causal relationship between lung function and the risk of VTE events. The borderline causal effect of PE on FEV1 and the significant genetic correlation of FEV1 with DVT may have clinical implications for improving the quality of existing prevention and intervention strategies.",Respiratory research,2023,Humans; Venous Thromboembolism; Genome-Wide Association Study; Risk Factors; Pulmonary Embolism; Lung,False,8
FinnGen,38283337,Two-sample Mendelian randomization to study the causal association between gut microbiota and atherosclerosis.,"According to some recent observational studies, the gut microbiota influences atherosclerosis via the gut microbiota-artery axis. However, the causal role of the gut microbiota in atherosclerosis remains unclear. Therefore, we used a Mendelian randomization (MR) strategy to try to dissect this causative link. The biggest known genome-wide association study (GWAS) (n = 13,266) from the MiBioGen collaboration was used to provide summary data on the gut microbiota for a two-sample MR research. Data on atherosclerosis were obtained from publicly available GWAS data from the FinnGen consortium, including cerebral atherosclerosis (104 cases and 218,688 controls), coronary atherosclerosis (23,363 cases and 187,840 controls), and peripheral atherosclerosis (6631 cases and 162,201 controls). The causal link between gut microbiota and atherosclerosis was investigated using inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode approaches, among which inverse variance weighting was the main research method. Cochran's Q statistic was used to quantify the heterogeneity of instrumental variables (IVs), and the MR Egger intercept test was used to assess the pleiotropy of IVs. Inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) estimation showed that  We discovered that the presence of probiotics and pathogens in the host is causally associated with atherosclerosis, and atherosclerosis at different sites is causally linked to specific gut microbiota. The specific gut microbiota associated with atherosclerosis identified by Mendelian randomization studies provides precise clinical targets for the treatment of atherosclerosis.

FinnGen,38128388,Mendelian randomization reveals systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.,"The effect of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on adverse pregnancy outcomes is a controversial topic. This study aimed to use Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causal relationship between SLE, RA and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Genetic variants for SLE and RA, as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes, were derived from pooled statistics from large public genome-wide association studies. Several methods, such as inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median and MR-Pleiotropic Residuals Sum and Outliers, were employed to estimate two-sample causality. Genetic prediction of SLE was associated with higher odds of preterm labour [odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.05; p = 0.008]. RA was associated with higher odds of preterm labour (OR 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.06; p = 0.009), pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07; p = 0.005), and poor fetal growth (OR 1.08, 95 % CI 1.04-1.12; p = 2.91 × 10 This study found a genetic association between SLE and the risk of preterm labour, and highlights the importance of perinatal care and monitoring for patients with SLE. Furthermore, RA was found to be associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes, including preterm labour, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, and poor fetal growth; as such, there is a need for more intensive therapeutic interventions and prenatal monitoring.","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2024,"Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Female; Pregnancy Outcome; Pre-Eclampsia; Eclampsia; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Obstetric Labor, Premature; Fetal Growth Retardation",False,3
FinnGen,37188918,Is there an association between periodontitis and breast cancer?,"This study uses bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) statistics to assess the causal association between periodontitis and breast cancer. Periodontitis data from the FinnGen project and breast cancer data from OpenGWAS was used, with all data subjects being of European ancestry. Periodontitis cases were categorized by probing depths or self-reporting according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/American Academy of Periodontology definition. 3046 periodontitis cases and 195,395 control cases along with 76,192 cases of breast cancer and 63,082 control cases were obtained from GWAS data. R (version 4.2.1) through TwoSampleMR and MRPRESSO were used for data analysis. Primary analysis was conducted using the inverse-variance weighted method. Horizontal pleiotrophy was corrected and causal effects were examined through detection methods of the weighted median method, weighted mode method, simple mode, MR-Egger regression method, and MR-pleiosis residual and outlier method (MR-PRESSO). A heterogeneity test was adopted for the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) analysis method and MR-Egger regression (P > 0.05). Pleiotropy was evaluated using the MR-Egger intercept value. The P-value of the pleiotropy test was then used to analyze the existence of pleiotropy. Where P > 0.05, the possibility of pleiotropy in the causal analysis was considered to be less or non-existent. Leave-one-out analysis was used to tested the consistency of results. 171 single nucleotide polymorphisms were extracted for MR analysis where breast cancer was the exposure and periodontitis the outcome. The total sample size of periodontitis was 198,441, and 139,274 for breast cancer. Overall results showed breast cancer had no effect on periodontitis (IVW P = 0.1408, MR-egger P = 0.1785, weighted median P = 0.1885), with Cochran's Q analysis showing no heterogenicity amongst these instrumental variables (P > 0.05). 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms were extracted for MR analysis where periodontitis was the exposure and breast cancer the outcome. No significant correlation was found between periodontitis and breast cancer (IVW P = 0.8251, MR-egger P = 0.6072, weighted median P = 0.6848).

FinnGen,36441335,Body mass index and the risk of abdominal hernia: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Abdominal hernia (AH) is one of the most common clinical diseases. A large number of observational studies have found that obesity is an important risk factor for AH. However, the causal relationship between obesity and AH cannot be determined because of the clinical studies on AH induced by obesity are relatively few and only have some small- or medium-scale observational studies. Observational studies have so many confounding factors and reverse causality due to their shortcomings. From an evidence-based medicine perspective, they are not sufficiently convincing. Therefore, there is still a lack of high-quality, evidence-based medical evidence supporting a causal relationship between obesity and AH. A causal relationship between obesity and AH is also almost impossible to confirm by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our study based on Mendelian randomization (MR) may provide a higher level of evidence-based medical support for the relationship between obesity and AH. Body mass index (BMI) is the most common measure used for defining obesity. Finally, we employed two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) to explore the causal relationship between BMI and AH. AH-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data were obtained from the FinnGen Biobank (FB), and BMI-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data were obtained from the UK Biobank (UKB). Genetic loci are used as instrumental variables (IVs), methods such as inverse variance weighted (IVW) were used for two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis, and the odds ratio (OR) value was used to evaluate the causal relationship between BMI and AH. The results of the horizontal pleiotropy test were calculated by Egger-intercept method: p = 0.34 > 0.05. The Cochran Q test of MR-Egger method and IVW method showed heterogeneity P = 0.03 < 0.05, so the IVW random effect model was used as the gold standard. We found a genetically determined 1-standard deviation (SD) increment of BMI causally increased a 66.0% risk of AH (N = 371 SNPs, OR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.46-1.89, p = 1.55E-14) based on the IVW random effect model which was almost consistent with the results of other seven methods. Our MR found genetic evidence for BMI and AH. The risk of developing AH increases with the number of BMI. This finding provides further evidence that maintaining a healthy BMI can prevent the development of AH. In addition, clinicians may need to focus on the potential risk of AH on some high-BMI patients.",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,2023,Humans; Body Mass Index; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Herniorrhaphy; Nonoxynol; Obesity,False,8

The patients were chosen from five different biobank hospitals in Finland. A rheumatologist reviewed the medical records to assess whether each patients' diagnosis was correct. The diagnosis was compared with the diagnostic codes in the Finnish Care Register for Health Care (CRHC) and special reimbursement data of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. The positive predictive value (PPV) of CRHC diagnosis of RA (for seropositive and seronegative RA combined) was 0.82. For patients with a special reimbursement for anti-rheumatic medications for RA, the PPV was 0.89. The PPV was higher in patients with more than one visit.

However, observational studies cannot provide direct evidence of causality between MD and delirium. This study explored the genetic causal association between MD and delirium using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data for MD were obtained from the UK Biobank. GWAS summary data for delirium were obtained from the FinnGen Consortium. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode were used to perform the MR analysis.

Horizontal pleiotropy was detected using the MR-Egger intercept test and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outliers (MR-PRESSO) test. Leave-one-out analysis was used to investigate the sensitivity of this association. The IVW method showed that MD was an independent risk factor for delirium (P = 0.013). Horizontal pleiotropy was unlikely to bias causality (P > 0.05), and no evidence of heterogeneity was found between the genetic variants (P > 0.05). Finally, a leave-one-out test showed that this association was stable and robust. All participants included in the GWAS were of European ancestry.

Our objective is to elucidate the causal relationship between malignant lymphoma and BC through Mendelian randomization (MR). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from 181,125 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients and 181,289 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients from the FinnGen Consortium were utilized as exposure. We selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly associated with the exposure as instrumental variables to investigate their relationship with BC in a cohort of 107,722 participants. Subsequently, we obtained data from the UK Biobank containing gender-stratified information on HL, NHL, and BC. We validated the findings from our analysis and explored the impact of gender.

FinnGen,38042639,Circulating Biomarkers and Risk of Hypertension: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomisation Study.,"This study systematically assessed circulating proteins to identify new serum biomarkers and risk of hypertension using Mendelian randomisation. The associations between 4,782 human circulating proteins and the risk of hypertension were evaluated using two-sample Mendelian randomisation. The FinnGen study demonstrated a link between genetic predisposition and hypertension in 85,438 cases and 223,663 controls. Inverse variance weighted and sensitivity analysis revealed nine proteins in circulation that have a causative effect on hypertension. SMOC1 and TIE1 were determined to be causative factors in the decreased likelihood of developing hypertension, with odds ratios of 0.86 (95% CI 0.81-0.91; p=1.06e-06) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.94-0.98; p=9.39e-05), respectively. NDUFB4, ETHE1, POFUT2, TRIL, ADAM23, GXYLT1, OXT, TPST2, and TMCC3 showed a possible connection to hypertension. This two-sample Mendelian randomisation study found that SMOC1 and TIE1 are causally linked to hypertension, making them a promising target for therapy.","Heart, lung & circulation",2023,"Humans; Biomarkers; Hypertension; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mitochondrial Proteins; Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins",False,4
FinnGen,38015883,Mendelian randomization reveals no correlations between herpesvirus infection and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,"Previous studies have found that the persistence of herpesvirus significantly increases the risk of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but it is unclear whether this effect is causal. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to evaluate the causal relationship between three herpesvirus infections and IPF. We used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from three independent datasets, including FinnGen cohort, Milieu Intérieur cohort, and 23andMe cohort, to screen for instrumental variables (IVs) of herpesvirus infection or herpesvirus-related immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. Outcome dataset came from the largest meta-analysis of IPF susceptibility currently available. In the FinnGen cohort, genetically predicted Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (OR = 1.105, 95%CI: 0.897-1.149, p = 0.815), cytomegalovirus (CMV) (OR = 1.073, 95%CI: 0.926-1.244, p = 0.302) and herpes simplex (HSV) infection (OR = 0.906, 95%CI: 0.753-1.097, p = 0.298) were not associated with the risk of IPF. In the Milieu Intérieur cohort, we found no correlations between herpesvirus-related IgG EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1) (OR = 0.968, 95%CI: 0.782-1.198, p = 0.764), EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) (OR = 1.061, 95CI%: 0.811-1.387, p = 0.665), CMV (OR = 1.108, 95CI%: 0.944-1.314, p = 0.240), HSV-1 (OR = 1.154, 95%CI: 0.684-1.945, p = 0.592) and HSV-2 (OR = 0.915, 95%CI: 0.793-1.056, p = 0.225) and IPF risk.

However, the causal link between these two phenotypes remains uncertain. This study aimed to examine the bidirectional causal association between periodontitis and four types of urological tumors, specifically kidney cancer (KC), prostate cancer (PC), bladder cancer (BC), and testis cancer (TC). Based on large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we utilized the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to evaluate causal relationships between periodontitis and urological cancers. Several MR methods covering various consistency assumptions were applied in this study, including contamination mixture and Robust Adjusted Profile Score to obtain robust results. Summary-level data of individuals with European ancestry were extracted from the UK Biobank, the Kaiser GERA cohorts, and the FinnGen consortium. Our findings revealed significant positive genetic correlations between periodontitis and kidney cancer (OR 1.287; 95% CI 1.04, 1.594; P = 0.020). We did not find a significant association of periodontitis on prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and testis cancer. In reverse MR, no significant results were observed supporting the effect of urologic cancers on periodontitis (all P > 0.05).

The etiology incudes both genetic and nongenetic factors, but persons carrying mutations in known hypercholesterolemia-associated genes are at significantly higher CAD risk than non-carriers. Yet, a significant proportion of mutation carriers remains undetected while the assessment of genetic candidate variants in clinical practice is challenging. To address these challenges, we set out to test the utility of a practical approach to leverage data from a large reference cohort, the FinnGen Study encompassing 356,082 persons with extensive longitudinal health record information, to aid the clinical evaluation of single genetic candidate genes variants detected by exome sequence analysis in a target population of 351 persons with severe hypercholesterolemia. We identified 23 rare missense mutations in known hypercholesterolemia genes, 3 of which were previously described mutations (LDLR Pro309Lysfs, LDLR Arg595Gln and APOB Arg3527Gln). Subsequent in silico and clinical assessment of the remaining 20 variants pinpointed two likely hypercholesterolemia-associated variants in LDLR (Arg574Leu and Glu626Lys) and one in LDLRAP1 (Arg151Trp). Heterozygous carriers of the novel LDLR and LDLRAP1 variants received statin treatment more often than non-carriers (OR 2.1, p = 1.8e-6 and OR 1.4, p = 0.001) and untreated carriers had higher risk for ischemic heart disease (OR 2.0, p = 0.03 and OR 1.8, p = 0.008).

FinnGen,37605959,The relationship between sex hormone-binding protein and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease using Mendelian randomisation.,"The incidence of non-alcohol fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing annually with the improvement of living standards. Numerous epidemiological observations have linked sex hormone-binding protein (SHBG) levels to NAFLD. However, evidence of the causal role of SHBG in the development and progression of NAFLD is still absent. Therefore, a systematic assessment of the causal relationship is needed. A two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis was conducted. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for SHBG were obtained online from the IEU database (ebi-a-GCST90012111) as exposure. GWAS data from the NAFLD of the Finngen consortium were used for preliminary analysis, while NAFLD data from another GWAS involving 8434 participants were used for replication and meta-analyses. Causal effects were investigated with inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median and MR-Egger regression. Sensitivity analyses including Cochran's Q test, leave-one-out analysis and MR-Egger intercept analysis were simultaneously conducted to assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy. After rigorous selection, 179 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified as strongly correlated instrumental variables. Preliminary analysis suggested a significant causal relationship between genetically determined serum SHBG levels and NAFLD [odds ratio (OR)  The genetic tendency to high levels of SHBG was causally correlated with a reduced risk of NAFLD, indicating that circulating high levels of SHBG was a protective factor for NAFLD.",European journal of clinical investigation,2024,"Humans; Blood Proteins; Databases, Factual; Genome-Wide Association Study; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease",False,8
FinnGen,37143736,Genetically predicted alterations in thyroid function are associated with the risk of benign prostatic disease.,"Benign prostatic diseases (BPDs), such as benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis, harm the quality of life of affected patients. However, observational studies exploring the association between thyroid function and BPDs have hitherto yielded inconsistent results. In this study, we explored whether there is a causal genetic association between them using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. We used publicly available summary statistics from the Thyroidomics Consortium and 23andMe on thyrotropin (TSH; 54,288 participants), thyroxine [free tetraiodothyronine (FT4); 49,269 participants], subclinical hypothyroidism (3,440 cases and 49,983 controls), overt hypothyroidism (8,000 cases and 117,000 controls), and subclinical hyperthyroidism (1,840 cases and 49,983 controls) to screen for instrumental variables of thyroid function. Results for BPD such as prostatic hyperplasia (13,118 cases and 72,799 controls) and prostatitis (1,859 cases and 72,799 controls) were obtained from the FinnGen study. The causal relationship between thyroid function and BPD was primarily assessed using MR with an inverse variance weighted approach. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. We found that TSH [OR (95% CI) = 0.912(0.845-0.984),  Overall, our study results suggest that hypothyroidism and TSH levels influence the risk of genetically predicted BPH and prostatitis, providing new insights into the causal relationship between thyroid function and BPD.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023,Humans; Male; Hyperthyroidism; Hypothyroidism; Prostatic Hyperplasia; Prostatitis; Quality of Life; Thyrotropin,False,0
FinnGen,37516996,Genetic variation in solute carrier family 5 member 2 mimicking sodium-glucose co-transporter 2-inhibition and risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality: reduced risk not explained by lower plasma glucose.,"Treatment with sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2)-inhibitors reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality, but the mechanism is unclear. We hypothesized that a functional genetic variant in solute carrier family 5 member 2 (SLC5A2), known to be associated with familial renal glucosuria, would mimic pharmacological SGLT2-inhibition, and thus provide an opportunity to examine potential mediators of the effects on lower risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. We examined 112 712 individuals from the Copenhagen City Heart Study and Copenhagen General Population Study (CCHS + CGPS), 488 687 from the UK Biobank, and 342 499 from FinnGen, genotyped for SLC5A2 rs61742739, c.1961A > G; p.(Asn654Ser). The 2.0% heterozygotes and 0.01% homozygotes were pooled as carriers and compared with the 98% non-carriers. First, we examined the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality; second, whether carrying the variant was associated with potential mediators of the effect; and third, whether identified potential mediators could explain the observed reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. In the CCHS + CGPS, carriers vs. non-carries had a 31% lower risk of heart failure, 21% lower risk of myocardial infarction, 16% lower risk of ischaemic heart disease, and 22% lower risk of all-cause mortality. Corresponding values in meta-analyses of the three studies combined were lower risk by 10%, 6%, 6%, and 10%, respectively. The SLC5A2 rs61742739 variant was not associated with a risk of ischaemic stroke or cardiovascular mortality. Of the lower risks observed in CCHS + CGPS, lower plasma glucose mediated 2.0%(P = 0.004) on heart failure, 3.1%(P = 0.09) on myocardial infarction, 4.1%(P = 0.02) on ischaemic heart disease, and 6.0%(P = 0.39) on all-cause mortality; corresponding values in the UK Biobank were 2.9%(P = 0.70), 1.5%(P = 0.77), 4.1%(P = 0.23), and 3.1%(P = 0.21), respectively.

However, the link between RS and GERD has not been fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between GERD and acute (ARS) or chronic RS (CRS), providing references for the pathogenesis and management of RS. The data were obtained from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit Open GWAS project and FinnGen. A total of 972,838 individuals were included. The inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method was applied to obtain the primary results of the study. Weighted median, MR-Egger, and mode-based methods were used to determine the robustness of the results. Cochran's Q statistic and MR-Egger method were applied to detect heterogeneity and pleiotrophy in instrumental variables (IVs). Other sensitivity analyses included MR-PRESSO and leave-one-out analysis. The MR study showed that GERD was associated with an increased risk of CRS (OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.18-1.57, p &lt; 0.001). The results of other analysis methods were broadly consistent with the IVW estimate. No heterogeneity was detected by Cochran's Q test (p = 0.061) and MR-PRESSO (p = 0.074). No horizontal pleiotropy was shown in IVs (p = 0.700). GERD was also associated with an increased risk of ARS (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.17-1.48, p &lt; 0.001). Some analytical results were inconsistent with the IVW estimate. No heterogeneity and pleiotropy were observed. There was no sufficient evidence for a reverse causal effect of RS on GERD. Our study supported that GERD promoted the risk of CRS and may be a potential risk factor for ARS.

Genetic variants associated with DN and its risk factors, encompassing glycemic traits, lipidemic traits, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, obesity, and urate, were obtained from previously published genome-wide association studies. Summary-level statistics for AMD were acquired from the FinnGen database. Univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) were employed to conduct this investigation. Our MR analyses indicated that per 1-standard deviation (SD) increase of DN heightened the risk of overall AMD (p = 1.03 × 10 These findings suggest that the impact of DN on the development of AMD may be more substantial than previously believed.

Miner is high-risk population for COPD, but the global prevalence of COPD in this group is inaccurate. In this study, the environmental and occupational risk factors for COPD were explored comprehensively with a two-sample Mendelian randomization study by combining genome-wide association data from two large global sample sizes of publicly available databases, UK Biobank (n = 503,317) and FinnGen (n = 193,638), as well as the prevalence of COPD among miners was investigated with meta-analysis followed a random-effects model including seven studies (16,033 miners in total). This study found that asthma, smoking, shift work, and workplace dust exposure may increase an individual's risk of COPD. The pooled prevalence of COPD among miners globally was 12% (95% CI: 8%, 18%), with higher prevalence of COPD among ex-smokers and dust-exposed individuals, and was significantly influenced by the method of diagnosis. Our findings suggest that there is currently a lack of practical criteria for diagnosing COPD in the physical examination and screening of miners. The actual prevalence of COPD may be underestimated due to the healthy worker effect and the phenomenon of job switching, and appropriate policies should be favored in the future to reduce the risk of COPD in miner.",Environmental science and pollution research international,2023,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Prevalence; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Risk Factors; Dust",False,7

However, it remains uncertain whether the relationship between GM and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is causal. We carried out a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, utilizing data from the most extensive GM-focused genome-wide association study by the MiBioGen consortium, with a sample size of 13,266. Data for BPH, encompassing 26,358 cases and 110,070 controls, were obtained from the R8 release of the FinnGen consortium. We employed multiple techniques, such as inverse variance weighted (IVW), constrained maximum likelihood and model averaging methods, maximum likelihood, MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MRPRESSO),MR-Egger, and weighted median methods, to investigate the causal relationship between GM and BPH. To evaluate the heterogeneity among the instrumental variables, Cochran's Q statistics were employed. Additionally, the presence of horizontal pleiotropy was assessed through the application of both MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO tests. The direction of causality was scrutinized for robustness using the MR-Steiger directionality test. A reverse MR analysis examined the GM previously linked to BPH through a causal relationship in the forward MR assessment. According to the analysis conducted using IVW,Eisenbergiella (odds ratio [OR]=0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.99,P=0.022) and Ruminococcaceae (UCG009) (OR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99, P=0.027) were found to reduce the risk of BPH, while Escherichia shigella (OR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.05-1.36, P=0.0082) appeared to increase it. The subsequent reverse MR analysis revealed that the three GM were not significantly influenced by BPH, and there was no noticeable heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy among the instrumental variables.Conclusion: These results indicated a causal relationship between Eisenbergiella, Ruminococcaceae (UCG009), and Escherichia shigella and BPH.

In this study, we performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess the associations of genetically determined liver fat, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and body mass index (BMI) with the risk of PLC. The summary statistics of exposures were obtained from two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) based on the UK Biobank (UKB) imaging cohort and the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. GWAS summary statistics for PLC were obtained from FinnGen consortium R7 release data, including 304 PLC cases and 218 488 controls. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) was used as the primary analysis, and a series of sensitivity analyses were performed to further verify the robustness of these findings. IVW analysis highlighted a significant association of genetically determined liver fat (OR per SD increase: 7.14; 95% CI: 5.10-9.99; P = 2.35E-30) and VAT (OR per SD increase: 5.70; 95% CI: 1.32-24.72; P = .020) with PLC but not of BMI with PLC. The findings were further confirmed by a series of MR methods. No evidence of horizontal pleiotropy between these associations existed.

A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted to investigate the relationship between the GM and POI. Data on the GM were based on the MiBioGen consortium's summary statistics from the most comprehensive genome-wide association study meta-analysis to date (n=13,266), and POI data were obtained from the R8 release of the FinnGen consortium, containing a total of 424 cases and 181,796 controls. A variety of analytical methods, including inverse variance weighting, maximum likelihood, MR-Egger, weighted median, and constrained maximum likelihood and model averaging and Bayesian information criterion, were utilized to explore the connection between the GM and POI. The Cochran's Q statistics were used to evaluate the heterogeneity of instrumental variables.

The MR Steiger test was used to evaluate the strength of causal relationships. A reverse MR study was performed to investigate the causal relationship between POI and the targeted GMs which were indicated to have a causal relationship with POI in the forward MR evaluation. The inverse variance weighted analysis indicated that Eubacterium (hallii group) (odds ratio [OR]=0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26-0.9, P=0.022) and Eubacterium (ventriosum group) (OR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.27-0.97, P=0.04) had protective effects on POI, and Intestinibacter (OR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.04-3.2, P=0.037) and Terrisporobacter (OR=2.47, 95% CI: 1.14-5.36, P=0.022) had detrimental effects on POI.

We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the causal association between tea intake and several acute cerebrovascular events, including any ischemic stroke, large atherosclerotic stroke (LAS), cardiogenic embolic stroke (CES), small vessel stroke (SVS), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We obtained summary genome-wide association study (GWAS) data on tea intake and acute cerebrovascular events in populations of European ancestry. The GWAS on tea intake is derived from the UK Biobank, where we have chosen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) closely associated with it as instrumental variables. We also obtained summary data on ischemic stroke from a GWAS meta-analysis, as well as summary data on ICH and SAH from the FinnGen study. We first explored the causal association between tea intake and several acute cerebrovascular events using univariate Mendelian randomization (UVMR), and then further assessed the causal association between tea intake and SVS using multivariate Mendelian randomization (MVMR) corrected for multiple confounders. In UVMR, genetically predicted increases in tea intake were linked to a lower risk of SVS (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.86). There was no causal association between tea intake and the risk of other acute cerebrovascular events. In the MVMR, our results show that there was still a significant causal association between drinking tea and SVS, after adjusting body mass index, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and alcohol consumption.

FinnGen,37612215,Investigation of the causal relationship between Interleukin-6 signaling and gastrointestinal tract cancers: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies indicate that interleukin-6(IL-6) has been associated with gastrointestinal tract cancers. However, the causal association is still confusing. Thus, we aimed to putative the causality between IL-6 signaling and gastrointestinal tract cancers. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to assess the causal effects. Two groups of IL-6 signaling-related single nucleotide polymorphisms were chosen from two Genome-wide association studies. Summary-level data for gastrointestinal tract cancers including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancer, were obtained from the FinnGen consortium and UK Biobank study. We also performed survival analysis to explore the prognostic value of IL-6 in gastrointestinal tract cancers. Genetically predicted plasma sIL6R level, which inhibits IL-6 Signaling, was associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer in FinnGen. In the combined analysis of the two sources, genetically predicted sIL6R was associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer (OR = 0.943, 95%CI: 0.904,0.983, p = 0.006). Survival analysis results indicated the prognostic value of IL-6 in gastric cancer. These results present evidence indicating that genetically-determined reduced IL-6 signaling lowers the risk of gastric cancer, which may provide potential prevention and therapeutic strategies for gastric cancer. Additionally, IL-6 may be a prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer.",Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,2024,"Humans; Stomach Neoplasms; Interleukin-6; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8
FinnGen,37777755,KIF15 missense variant is associated with the early onset of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has an unknown aetiology and limited treatment options. A recent meta-analysis identified three novel causal variants in the TERT, SPDL1, and KIF15 genes. This observational study aimed to investigate whether the aforementioned variants cause clinical phenotypes in a well-characterised IPF cohort. The study consisted of 138 patients with IPF who were diagnosed and treated at the Helsinki University Hospital and genotyped in the FinnGen FinnIPF study. Data on > 25 clinical parameters were collected by two pulmonologists who were blinded to the genetic data for patients with TERT loss of function and missense variants, SPDL1 and KIF15 missense variants, and a MUC5B variant commonly present in patients with IPF, or no variants were separately analysed. The KIF15 missense variant is associated with the early onset of the disease, leading to progression to early-age transplantation or death. In patients with the KIF15 variant, the median age at diagnosis was 54.0 years (36.5-69.5 years) compared with 72.0 years (65.8-75.3 years) in the other patients (P = 0.023). The proportion of KIF15 variant carriers was 9- or 3.6-fold higher in patients aged < 55 or 65 years, respectively. The variants for TERT and MUC5B had similar effects on the patient's clinical course, as previously described. No distinct phenotypes were observed in patients with the SPDL1 variant. Our study indicated the potential of KIF15 to be used in the genetic diagnostics of IPF. Further studies are needed to elucidate the biological mechanisms of KIF15 in IPF.",Respiratory research,2023,Humans; Middle Aged; Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis; Genotype; Phenotype; Mucin-5B; Kinesins,False,0
FinnGen,37704630,Quantifying the causal impact of biological risk factors on healthcare costs.,"Understanding the causal impact that clinical risk factors have on healthcare-related costs is critical to evaluate healthcare interventions. Here, we used a genetically-informed design, Mendelian Randomization (MR), to infer the causal impact of 15 risk factors on annual total healthcare costs. We calculated healthcare costs for 373,160 participants from the FinnGen Study and replicated our results in 323,774 individuals from the United Kingdom and Netherlands. Robust causal effects were observed for waist circumference (WC), adult body mass index, and systolic blood pressure, in which a standard deviation increase corresponded to 22.78% [95% CI: 18.75-26.95], 13.64% [10.26-17.12], and 13.08% [8.84-17.48] increased healthcare costs, respectively. A lack of causal effects was observed for certain clinically relevant biomarkers, such as albumin, C-reactive protein, and vitamin D. Our results indicated that increased WC is a major contributor to annual total healthcare costs and more attention may be given to WC screening, surveillance, and mitigation.",Nature communications,2023,Adult; Humans; Causality; Health Care Costs; Risk Factors; Albumins; Body Mass Index,False,1
FinnGen,36384228,Genetic Predisposition of Both Waist Circumference and Hip Circumference Increased the Risk of Venous Thromboembolism.," Obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is an independent indicator of increased cardiovascular risk. Observational studies have shown an observational association between obesity and venous thromboembolism (VTE). As a type of VTE, pulmonary embolism (PE) is also associated with obesity. However, it is unclear whether the observed associations are causal or caused by confounding bias or reverse causality.  We performed a two-sample test by obtaining the exposure dataset of waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC) from the Neale Laboratory Consortium's genome-wide association study summary data and the summary-level outcome data of VTE and PE from FinnGen Biobank of European ancestry to determine the causal effect of WC and HC on VTE and PE.  All three Mendelian randomization methods displayed a positive association between WC/HC and VTE/PE. WC and HC were positively associated with VTE (odds ratio [OR] = 1.803 per 1 standard deviation [SD] increase in WC, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.393-2.333;   There is a significant causal relationship between WC/HC and VTE/PE, which is consistent with observational studies.

FinnGen,37581757,Association between alcohol and urolithiasis: a mendelian randomization study.,"The causal relationship between alcohol and urolithiasis remains uncertain, despite previous observational studies reporting an association between the two. To determine the causality, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the causal relationship between alcohol and kidney stones using a two-sample MR approach. Two sets of genetic instruments were utilized in the analysis, both of which were derived from publicly available genetic summary data. The first set consisted of 73 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) robustly linked to alcohol intake frequency (AIF) and the second set was comprised of 69 SNPs associated with alcohol consumption (AC). Our MR analysis was performed using several methods including the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, weighted median method, MR-Egger regression, MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier test. Our results from the MR analysis revealed a borderline significant association between AIF and the risk of urolithiasis. This was established through the use of the IVW method (OR (95% CI) = 1.29 (1.02, 1.65), p = 0.036) and the weighted median approach (OR (95% CI) = 1.44 (1.10, 1.89), p = 0.008). The MR-Egger model also yielded similar risk estimates (OR (95% CI) = 1.39 (0.66, 2.93), p = 0.386), although the relationship was not statistically significant. Sixty-eight SNPs were identified as having a substantial and independent link with AC. However, the IVW approach revealed no significant effect of AC on the risk of urolithiasis (OR (95% CI) = 0.74 (0.48, 1.14), p = 0.173). The MR analysis suggested a potential causal association between alcohol intake frequency and the risk of urolithiasis, but not alcohol consumption.",Urolithiasis,2023,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Ethanol; Urolithiasis; Kidney Calculi; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8
FinnGen,37505304,Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and the risk of valvular heart disease: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies have suggested that immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are associated with a higher risk of valvular heart disease (VHD). But the potential causal association is not clear. Therefore, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causal association of IMIDs with VHD risk. A two-sample MR analysis was performed to confirm the causal association of several common IMIDs (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE; rheumatoid arthritis, RA; multiple sclerosis, MS; ankylosing spondylitis, AS; psoriasis, PSO; inflammatory bowel disease, IBD) with the risk of VHD. The exposure data is derived from published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and outcome data come from the FinnGen database (47,003 cases and 182,971 controls). Inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median methods were performed to assess the causal association. The study design applied univariable MR and multivariable MR. The MR analysis indicated that several genetically predicted IMIDs increased the risk of VHD, including SLE (odds ratio (OR) = 1.014; 95% confidence interval (CI) =  < 1.001,1.028 > ; p = 0.036), RA (OR = 1.017; 95% CI =  < 1.002,1.031 > ; p = 0.025), and IBD (OR = 1.018; 95% CI =  < 1.002,1.033 > ; p = 0.023). Multivariable MR indicated that the adverse effect of these IMIDs on VHD was dampened to varying degrees after adjusting for smoking, obesity, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. Our findings support the first genetic evidence of the causality of genetically predicted IMIDs with the risk of developing into VHD. Our results deliver a viewpoint that further active intervention needs to be explored to mitigate VHD risk in patients with SLE, RA, and IBD. Key Points • Genetically predicted systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are causally associated with valvular heart disease (VHD). • To reduce the risk of VHD in patients with SLE, RA, and IBD, active interventions should be further explored.",Clinical rheumatology,2024,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Heart Valve Diseases; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Immunomodulating Agents; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,7
FinnGen,36866422,Apparent treatment-resistant hypertension associated lifetime cardiovascular risk in a longitudinal national registry.,"Apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (aRH), wherein blood pressure elevation requires treatment with multiple medications, is associated with adverse cardiovascular events over the short-term. We sought to evaluate the degree of excess risk associated with aRH across the lifespan. We identified all individuals with hypertension who were prescribed at least one anti-hypertensive medication from the FinnGen Study, a cohort of randomly selected individuals across Finland. We then identified the maximum number of concurrently prescribed anti-hypertensive medication classes prior to age 55 and classified those co-prescribed ≥4 anti-hypertensive medication classes as aRH. Using multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, we assessed the association of aRH well as the number of co-prescribed anti-hypertensive classes with cardiorenal outcomes across the lifespan. Among 48 721 hypertensive individuals, 5715 (11.7%) met the aRH criteria. Compared to those prescribed only one anti-hypertensive medication class, the lifetime risk of renal failure increased with the addition of each additional medication class, beginning with the second, while the risk of heart failure and ischaemic stroke increased after addition of the third drug class. Similarly, those with aRH suffered increased risk of renal failure (hazard ratio 2.30, 95% CI 2.00-2.65), intracranial haemorrhage (1.50, 1.08-2.05), heart failure (1.40, 1.24-1.63) cardiac death (1.79, 1.45-2.21), and all-cause death (1.76, 1.52-2.04). Among individuals with hypertension, aRH that develops prior to mid-life is associated with substantially elevated cardiorenal disease risk across the lifespan. Examination of medical records from over 48 000 Finnish individuals found that the risk of future adverse medical events increased with a need for greater number of blood pressure medications in middle age.Using the number of blood pressure medications simultaneously prescribed before age 55, the risk of kidney problems increased with the addition of each antihypertensive medication, starting after the first, while the risk of heart failure and stroke increased with the addition of two more blood pressure medications.Individuals with very difficult to treat high blood pressure (needing at least four medications) had greater risk of nearly all assessed clinical outcomes, including death. These findings indicate that needing more medications to treat blood pressure in mid-life is associated with worse clinical outcomes. The most important goal for such patients should be to improve their blood pressure control early in life.",European journal of preventive cardiology,2023,Humans; Middle Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Cardiovascular Diseases; Brain Ischemia; Stroke; Risk Factors; Hypertension; Heart Failure; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Renal Insufficiency; Registries; Blood Pressure,False,8
FinnGen,37659917,Mendelian randomization analysis reveals causality of inflammatory bowel disease on risks of Henoch-Schönlein purpura and immune thrombocytopenia.,"Emerging clinical evidence has been discovered associating Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). However, it is unclear whether a cause-effect relationship exists between them. We aimed to examine the casual effect of IBD on the risk of HSP and ITP. Based on summary statistics from International IBD Genetics (IIBDG) Consortium and FinnGen study, a two-sample Mendelian randomization study was carried out to determine whether IBD including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) is causally related to HSP, ITP or secondary thrombocytopenia. To support the results, a variety of sensitivity analyses were performed. Significant causal relationships between IBD and HSP (odds ratios = 1.20, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.36, adjusted P = 0.006) and ITP (odds ratios =1.22, 95% confidence interval: 1.08-1.38, adjusted P = 0.006) were found. Both genetically predicted UC and CD were positively related with ITP, while CD alone may be responsible for the higher risk of HSP. Besides, no significant association was observed between IBD and secondary thrombocytopenia. The results of this Mendelian randomization study supported the causal association of IBD with HSP and ITP. Taken together, our findings may present implications for management of IBD.",Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,2024,"Humans; Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; IgA Vasculitis; Thrombocytopenia; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Crohn Disease; Colitis, Ulcerative",False,5

A Two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analysis, comprising univariate MR (UVMR) and multivariate MR (MVMR) analyses, was performed to investigate the potential causal association between three types of occupational exposures, jobs involving mainly walking or standing (JWS), jobs involving heavy manual or physical work (JMP), and jobs involving shift work(JSW) on RA and AS. Genetic variants for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of occupational exposure and AS were obtained from the UK Biobank. GWAS summary data for RA were obtained from FinnGen Biobank analysis. For UVMR, six methods of Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, Weighted Mode, Weighted Median, Simple Mode, MR pleiotropy residual sum, and outlier (MR-PRESSO) were used for the analysis. The MVMR was analyzed using the IVW model as well as the MR-Egger model. The UVMR suggested no causal relationship between the three occupational exposure and RA [IVW: P=0.59,0.21,0.63] or AS [IVW: P=0.43,0.57,0.04], as did the bidirectional MR [IVW: P=0.73,0.70,0.16], [IVW: P=0.65,0.68,0.74]. Although unadjusted MVMR suggested a causal relationship between JMP and AS [IVW: OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 1.00- 1.02, p = 0.02], the adjusted MVMR denied this relationship and concluded that there was no causal relationship between the other occupational exposure and either RA or AS.

To evaluate the causal effect of childhood BMI on LC susceptibility, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was performed. The two-sample MR analysis utilized 25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables for childhood BMI. Genetic summary data from the International Lung Cancer Consortium and FinnGen databases were analyzed to estimate the causal effect of these SNPs on LC susceptibility. The IVW method was employed as the primary analysis, supplemented by the Weighted Median, MR-Egger, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier test. Our findings indicated that there was no causal association between childhood BMI and the susceptibility of LC (odds ratio [OR]: 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90-1.17, p = 0.705), lung adenocarcinoma (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.86-1.13, p = 0.832), lung squamous cell carcinoma (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.84-1.13, p = 0.726), and small cell LC (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.82-1.45, p = 0.554) based on the IVW as well as other methods employed. Furthermore, these findings indicated no causal effect of childhood BMI on the LC susceptibility in both ever smokers and never smokers.

FinnGen,36018815,Large registry-based analysis of genetic predisposition to tuberculosis identifies genetic risk factors at HLA.,"Tuberculosis is a significant public health concern resulting in the death of over 1 million individuals each year worldwide. While treatment options and vaccines exist, a substantial number of infections still remain untreated or are caused by treatment resistant strains. Therefore, it is important to identify mechanisms that contribute to risk and prognosis of tuberculosis as this may provide tools to understand disease mechanisms and provide novel treatment options for those with severe infection. Our goal was to identify genetic risk factors that contribute to the risk of tuberculosis and to understand biological mechanisms and causality behind the risk of tuberculosis. A total of 1895 individuals in the FinnGen study had International Classification of Diseases-based tuberculosis diagnosis. Genome-wide association study analysis identified genetic variants with statistically significant association with tuberculosis at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region (P < 5e-8). Fine mapping of the HLA association provided evidence for one protective haplotype tagged by HLA DQB1*05:01 (P = 1.82E-06, OR = 0.81 [CI 95% 0.74-0.88]), and predisposing alleles tagged by HLA DRB1*13:02 (P = 0.00011, OR = 1.35 [CI 95% 1.16-1.57]). Furthermore, genetic correlation analysis showed association with earlier reported risk factors including smoking (P < 0.05). Mendelian randomization supported smoking as a risk factor for tuberculosis (inverse-variance weighted P < 0.05, OR = 1.83 [CI 95% 1.15-2.93]) with no significant evidence of pleiotropy.

A two-way, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted to evaluate the possible causal connection between the gut microbiota and the two outcomes of influenza (pneumonia without influenza and influenza pneumonia). The statistical analysis of gut microbiota is derived from the information of the most extensive meta-analysis (GWAS) conducted by the MiBioGen Alliance, encompassing a sample size of 18,340.The summary statistical data for influenza (not pneumonia, n = 291,090) and influenza pneumonia (n = 342,499) are from GWAS data published by FinnGen consortium R8.Estimate and summarize Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using Inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR Egger, and Weighted median (WM) in bidirectional MR analysis. To assess the heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and stability of SNPs, we employed Cochran's Q test, MR Egger intercept test, and sensitivity analysis. The IVW analysis indicated that there was a significant association between influenza infection and five bacterial taxa. Additionally, the abundance changes of seven gut microbiota were found to be causally related to influenza infection. In addition, seven bacterial taxa showed a significant association with the occurrence of influenza pneumonia. The findings from the WM analysis largely support the outcomes of IVW, however, the results of MR egger analysis do not align with IVW. Furthermore, there is no proof to substantiate the cause-and-effect relationship between influenza pneumonia and the composition of gut microbiota. This analysis demonstrates a possible bidirectional causal connection between the prevalence of particular gut microbiota and the occurrence of influenza infection. The presence of certain gut microbiota may potentially contribute to the development of pneumonia caused by influenza.

FinnGen,37807832,The effect of metformin on urate metabolism: Findings from observational and Mendelian randomization analyses.,"To evaluate the effect of metformin on urate metabolism. Using the UK Biobank, we first performed association analyses of metformin use with urate levels, risk of hyperuricaemia and incident gout in patients with diabetes. To explore the causal effect of metformin on urate and gout, we identified genetic variants proxying the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)-lowering effect of metformin targets and conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) utilizing the urate and gout genetic summary-level data from the CKDGen (n = 288 649) and the FinnGen cohort. We conducted two-step MR to explore the mediation effect of body mass index and systolic blood pressure. We also performed non-linear MR in the UK Biobank (n = 414 055) to show the results across HbA1c levels. In 18 776 patients with type 2 diabetes in UK Biobank, metformin use was associated with decreased urate [β = -4.3 μmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.0, -1.7, p = .001] and reduced hyperuricaemia risk (odds ratio = 0.87, 95% CI 0.79, 0.96, p = .004), but not gout. Genetically proxied averaged HbA1c-lowering effects of metformin targets, equivalent to a 0.62% reduction in HbA1c, was associated with reduced urate (β = -12.5 μmol/L, 95% CI -21.4, -4.2, p = .004). Body mass index significantly mediated this association (proportion mediated = 33.0%, p = .002). Non-linear MR results suggest a linear trend of the effect of metformin on urate reduction across various HbA1c levels. The effect of metformin may reduce urate levels but not incident gout in the general population.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2024,"Humans; Uric Acid; Hyperuricemia; Metformin; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glycated Hemoglobin; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Gout; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8

However, the causal relationship between GM and PC has yet to be confirmed. In the present study, we used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal effect between GM and PC, with genome-wide association study (GWAS) from MiBioGen consortium as an exposure factor and PC GWAS data from FinnGen as an outcome factor. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) was used as the primary method for this study. At the genus level, we observed that Senegalimassilia (OR: 0.635, 95% CI: 0.403-0.998, P = 0.049) exhibited a protective effect against PC, while Odoribacter (OR:1.899, 95%CI:1.157-3.116, P = 0.011), Ruminiclostridium 9(OR:1.976,95%CI:1.128-3.461, P = 0.017), Ruminococcaceae (UCG011)(OR:1.433, 95%CI:1.072-1.916, P = 0.015), and Streptococcus(OR:1.712, 95%CI:1.071-1.736, P = 0.025) were identified as causative factors for PC. Additionally, sensitivity analysis, Cochran's Q test, the Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO), and MR-Egger regression indicated no heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, or reverse causality between GM and PC.

This two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study aimed to evaluate the effects of long-term tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibition on cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and cardiometabolic risk factors via genetically proxied inhibition of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF. Two genetic instruments were examined to mimic the long-term effect of TNF inhibitors. The first were single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or nearby drug-target genes TNFRSF1A and TNF (encoding TNFR1 and TNF) associated with circulating CRP levels. The other instruments were the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) near the genes. Inverse variance-weighted MR (IVW-MR) and summary-based MR (SMR) methods were employed to estimate causal effects. In IVW-MR analysis, TNF-mediated circulating CRP levels were significantly associated with 4 out of 12 CVDs, including hypertension [odds ratio (OR) = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.09-1.18], coronary artery disease (OR = 3.18; 95% CI, 1.77-5.71), coronary atherosclerosis (OR = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08) and type 2 diabetes (OR = 3.48; 95% CI, 1.98-6.10). These findings were also validated in the FinnGen study. Moreover, TNF inhibition was also associated with total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, systolic blood pressure, serum cystatin C, height, weight, and body mass index.

FinnGen,37223029,Mendelian randomization indicates a causal contribution of type 2 diabetes to retinal vein occlusion.,"Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a common retinal vascular disease that can cause severe visual impairment. Many observational studies have shown that type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is associated with RVO, but it remains unknown if the association is causal. The present study aimed to perform Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to evaluate the causal contribution of genetically predicted T2DM to RVO. We obtained summary-level data from a genome-wide association study meta-analysis including 48,286 cases and 250,671 controls for T2DM and from a genome wide association study of 372 cases and 182,573 controls in the FinnGen project for RVO. To verify the robustness of the results, an independent validation dataset for T2DM (12,931 cases and 57,196 controls) was used. In addition to the main MR analysis using the inverse variance weighted (fixed effect) approach, sensitivity analyses and multivariable MR adjusting for common risk factors of RVO were conducted. Genetically predicted T2DM was found to be causally associated with RVO risk (odds ratio (OR)=2.823, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.072-3.847,  This study indicates that genetically predicted T2DM may have a causal contribution to RVO.

However, the nature and direction of this potential causal relationship are still unclear. This study used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to clarify the potential causal links. Summary-level Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) statistical data for gut microbiota and NAFLD/NASH were obtained from MiBioGen and FinnGen respectively. The MR analyses were performed mainly using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, with sensitivity analyses conducted to verify the robustness. Additionally, reverse MR analyses were performed to examine any potential reverse causal associations. Our analysis, primarily based on the IVW method, strongly supports the existence of causal relationships between four microbial taxa and NAFLD, and four taxa with NASH. Specifically, associations were observed between Enterobacteriales ( This study identified several specific gut microbiota that are causally related to NAFLD and NASH. Observations herein may provide promising theoretical groundwork for potential prevention and treatment strategies for NAFLD and its progression to NASH in future.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,Humans; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Clostridiaceae; Clostridiales,False,6

Early detection of circulating risk biomarkers is critical for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevention. We aimed to systematically assess the potential causal relationship of genetically predicted 60 circulatory biomarkers with NAFLD using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design. We extracted instrumental variables for 60 circulating biomarkers, and obtained genome-wide association data for NAFLD from 3 sources [(including Anstee, FinnGen and UK Biobank (N ranges: 19264-377988)] among individuals of European ancestry. Our primary method was inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR, with a series of additional and sensitivity analyses to test the hypothesis of MR. MR results showed that genetically predicted higher density lipoprotein-cholesterol (odds ratio (OR) = 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77-0.96) and vitamin D (OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.19-0.78) levels decreased the risk of NAFLD, whereas genetically predicted higher alanine (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.21-2.33), histidine (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.00-1.46), lactate (OR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.09-6.39), triglycerides (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.05-1.13), ferritin (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.01-1.37), serum iron (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07-1.41) and transferrin saturation (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.05-1.29), component 4 (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01-1.20), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.21) and interleukin-6 (OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.14-2.30) levels increased the risk of NAFLD.

Traditional observational studies have led to a limited understanding of the effects of GERD and BE on epilepsy due to the interference of reverse causation and potential confounders. We conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to determine whether GERD and BE can increase the risk of epilepsy. Genome-wide association study data on epilepsy and its subgroups were obtained from the International League Against Epilepsy consortium for primary analysis using three MR approaches and the FinnGen consortium for replication and meta-analysis. We calculated causal estimates between the two esophageal diseases and epilepsy using the inverse-variance weighted method. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to detect heterogeneity and pleiotropy. We found a potential effect of genetically predicted GERD on the risk of epilepsy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.078; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.014-1.146, p = .016).

This study aims to verify whether and why there is a causal relationship between these parameters, and whether there is an etiological basis. A two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was performed using 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with daytime napping. Summary-level data for coronary atherosclerosis, peripheral atherosclerosis, total CVD, and five CVD outcomes were obtained from the FinnGen study. Meta-analyses were aimed at investigating the relationships of excessive daytime napping with total CVD, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke incidence. Subgroup, network meta-analysis (NMA) and trial sequential analysis (TSA) were also performed in this study. The inverse-variance weighted method demonstrated that a genetic predisposition to more frequent daytime napping was significantly associated with higher odds of coronary atherosclerosis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11 to 2.17), MI (OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.06 to 2.50), and heart failure (OR = 1.80, 95%CI: 1.28 to 2.52). In NMA, an increased risk of developing CVD in people who napped for more than 60 min a day than those who did not nap was demonstrated and then supported by TSA results (summary relative risk = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.39 to 2.82). Habitual daytime napping is causally associated with an increased risk of incident CVD primarily via the development of coronary atherosclerosis.

However, it remains unclear whether this observed association was susceptible to potential confounding factors due to the long-term development process of CRC, and the risk of CRC associated with sweet beverages has rarely been reported. We aimed to investigate the association between SSBs/sweet beverages and CRC risk. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using independent genetic variants for SSBs and sweet beverages from a published genome-wide association study (GWAS). Summary statistics for instrument-outcome associations from two databases for malignant neoplasms of the colon and the rectum (FinnGen and UK Biobank). The inverse weighted method (IVW) meta-analysis was the main method used to estimate the relationship, and sensitivity analyses were performed with Cochran's Q test, leave-one-out analysis, MR-Egger regression, Steiger filtering, and the MR PRESSO test. Genetically predicted SSBs intake was associated with a higher colonic malignant neoplasms risk (odds ratio (OR): 1.013; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.001, 1.026; P = 0.036) in a combined sample size of 579,986 individuals (4029 cases). Such a significant causal effect of SSBs on rectal malignant neoplasms or sweet beverages on CRC was not observed.

The standardized treatments focus on alleviating symptoms. Despite the availability of medications for asthma, they have proven to be inadequate in controlling relapses and halting the progression of the disease. Therefore, there is a need for novel drug targets to prevent asthma. We utilized Mendelian randomization to investigate potential drug targets for asthma. We analyzed summary statistics from the UK Biobank and then replicated our findings in GWAS data by Demenais et al. and the FinnGen cohort. We obtained genetic instruments for 734 plasma and 73 brain proteins from recently reported GWAS. Next, we utilized reverse causal relationship analysis, Bayesian co-localization, and phenotype scanning as part of our sensitivity analysis.

Hence, we thoroughly investigate their causal relationship by means of a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, aiming to determine the impact of gut microbiota on the risk of developing intervertebral disc degeneration. Summary data from genome-wide association studies of GM (the MiBioGen) and IVDD (the FinnGen biobank) have been acquired. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was utilized as the primary MR analysis approach. Weighted median, MR-Egger regression, weighted mode, and simple mode were used as supplements. The Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) and MR-Egger regression were performed to assess horizontal pleiotropy. Cochran's Q test evaluated heterogeneity. Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was further conducted to determine the reliability of the causal relationship. A reverse MR analysis was conducted to assess potential reverse causation. We identified nine gut microbial taxa that were causally associated with IVDD (P < 0.05). Following the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected test, the association between the phylum Bacteroidetes and a higher risk of IVDD remained significant (IVW FDR-corrected P = 0.0365). The results of the Cochrane Q test did not indicate heterogeneity (P > 0.05). Additionally, both the MR-Egger intercept test and the MR-PRESSO global test revealed that our results were not influenced by horizontal pleiotropy (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the leave-one-out analysis substantiated the reliability of the causal relationship. In the reverse analysis, no evidence was found to suggest that IVDD has an impact on the gut microbiota.

We obtained single-nucleotide polymorphisms strongly associated with VAT (n = 325,153) from large-scale genome-wide association studies. Summary-level data for NAFLD (2275 cases and 375,002 controls) was available from the FinnGen consortium.

The random-effects inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the main MR approach, with alternate methods including the weighted median (WM) approach and MR-Egger regression. In addition, we conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of MR analyses. Genetically predicted higher VAT mass is causally associated with a higher risk of NAFLD. The three analysis results of MR were as follows: IVW (β = 0.665, odds ratio [OR] = 1.944, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.482-2.550, p = 1.58e-06], WM (β = 0.615, OR = 1.849, 95% CI = 1.272-2.689, p = 1.29e-03), and MR-Egger (β = 1.250, OR = 3.490, 95% CI = 1.522-7.998, p = 3.52e-03). In the sensitivity analysis, the data showed heterogeneity (p < 0.05) but no pleiotropy (p = 0.145).

In contrast, an effect of genetically determined AD on a decreased risk of cataract was observed with suggestive evidence (IVW odds ratio =0.96, 95% confidence interval: 0.93-0.99, p=0.004). However, this result might be distorted by survival bias. Genetically determined cataracts were not related to AD, as demonstrated by our study. In contrast, there was suggestive evidence that AD might prevent cataract development, but there might be potential survival bias. To define the exact association between the two diseases, more prospective research and studies on the pathogenesis are needed.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2023,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Prospective Studies; Cataract; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8
FinnGen,37952233,Does gestational diabetes mellitus increase the risk of cardiovascular disease? A Mendelian randomization study.,"In recent years, epidemiological studies have revealed the relationship between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this study, we utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the potential causal impact of GDM on cardiovascular disease for the first time.  We retrieved summary statistics from published genome-wide association studies. MR was first performed using significant SNPs extracted from the eighth data release of the FinnGen study. Next, a replication analysis for coronary artery disease (CAD) was conducted in another European ancestry population to validate our findings. Finally, mediation analysis was carried out to assess potential mediation effects. Our data analysis revealed that genetically predicted GDM was significantly associated with increased CAD risk (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18, p 0.006). Replication analysis confirmed a significant genetic association between GDM and CAD (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12, p 0.003) in another European ancestry population. Mediation analysis indicated no significant mediation effect by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on the GDM-CAD relationship (mediation effect β [95% CI]: 0.005 [-0.003, -0.017]). Women with a prior history of GDM face an elevated risk of future CAD. This increased risk of CAD cannot be solely attributed to the subsequent onset of diabetes. Regular CAD risk assessment and primary prevention strategies are of paramount importance for women with a history of GDM.",Journal of endocrinological investigation,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Pregnancy; Genome-Wide Association Study; Cardiovascular Diseases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Risk Factors; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Coronary Artery Disease",False,3
FinnGen,36928379,Iron homeostasis governs erythroid phenotype in polycythemia vera.,"Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm driven by activating mutations in JAK2 that result in unrestrained erythrocyte production, increasing patients' hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations, placing them at risk of life-threatening thrombotic events. Our genome-wide association study of 440 PV cases and 403 351 controls using UK Biobank data showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms in HFE known to cause hemochromatosis are highly associated with PV diagnosis, linking iron regulation to PV. Analysis of the FinnGen dataset independently confirmed overrepresentation of homozygous HFE variants in patients with PV. HFE influences the expression of hepcidin, the master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. Through genetic dissection of mouse models of PV, we show that the PV erythroid phenotype is directly linked to hepcidin expression: endogenous hepcidin upregulation alleviates erythroid disease whereas hepcidin ablation worsens it. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in PV, hepcidin is not regulated by expanded erythropoiesis but is likely governed by inflammatory cytokines signaling via GP130-coupled receptors. These findings have important implications for understanding the pathophysiology of PV and offer new therapeutic strategies for this disease.",Blood,2023,Animals; Mice; Polycythemia Vera; Hepcidins; Genome-Wide Association Study; Iron; Phenotype; Homeostasis,False,8

Based on this situation, this study aimed to assess the causal relationship between serum vitamin D levels and SS by using the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. In this study, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics on serum vitamin D levels [sample size = 417,580 (UK Biobank)] and SS [sample size = 416,757 (cases = 2495, controls = 414,262) (FinnGen)] were used. The bi-directional MR analysis was then used to assess possible causal relationships. The major analysis method of MR was performed using inverse-variance weighted (IVW), supplemented by MR-Egger and the weighted median approaches. In addition, sensitivity analyses were used to ensure the stability of the results, including Cochran's Q test, MR-PRESSO, MR-Egger intercept test, and the leave-one-out test. The MR suggested that no significant causal effects of serum 25(OH)D levels on SS risks were observed [odds ratio (OR) = 0.9824; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.7130 to 1.3538; P = 0.9137]. Similarly, no evidence supported the causal effects of SS on serum vitamin D levels (β: 0.0076, 95% CI: - 0.0031 to 0.0183; P = 0.1640).

This research article aims to investigate the shared risk factors between type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and CKD using a Mendelian randomization (MR) design. The study utilized genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets for T1D, T2D, and CKD from the FinnGen research project. GWAS summary statistics datasets for 118 exposure traits were obtained from the IEU OpenGWAS database. MR analyses were conducted to examine the causal relationships between exposure traits and each of the three outcomes. Multiple methods, including inverse-variance weighted, weighted median, and MR-Egger, were employed for the MR studies. Phenome-wide MR analyses revealed that eosinophil percentage exhibited a significant and suggestive causal association with T1D and CKD, respectively, suggesting its potential as a shared risk factor for T1D and CKD. For T2D, 34 traits demonstrated significant associations. Among these 34 traits, 14 were also significantly associated with CKD, indicating the presence of common risk factors between T2D and CKD, primarily related to obesity, height, blood lipids and sex hormone binding globulin, blood pressure, and walking pace. This research has uncovered the eosinophil percentage as a potential common risk factor for both T1D and CKD, while also identifying several traits, such as obesity and blood lipids, as shared risk factors for T2D and CKD.

The current study aimed to assess the causal effect of lifestyle factors, metabolic factors and socioeconomic status on POP risk. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study based on summary-level data from the largest available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to evaluate whether lifestyle factors, metabolic factors and socioeconomic status are causally related to POP. We used single nucleotide polymorphisms that are strongly associated with exposure at the genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10 There were associations with POP for genetically predicted waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (odds ratio (OR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.03 per SD-increase, P < 0.001), WHR adjusted for body mass index (WHRadjBMI) (OR 1.017, 95% CI 1.01-1.025 per SD-increase, P < 0.001) and education attainment (OR 0.986, 95% CI 0.98-0.991 per SD-increase) in the meta-analysis.

FinnGen,36989840,Genome-wide association study of obstructive sleep apnoea in the Million Veteran Program uncovers genetic heterogeneity by sex.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are limited due to the underdiagnosis of OSA, leading to misclassification of OSA, which consequently reduces statistical power. We performed a GWAS of OSA in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system, where OSA prevalence is close to its true population prevalence. We performed GWAS of 568,576 MVP participants, stratified by biological sex and by harmonized race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry (HARE) groups of White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian individuals. We considered both BMI adjusted (BMI-adj) and unadjusted (BMI-unadj) models. We replicated associations in independent datasets, and analysed the heterogeneity of OSA genetic associations across HARE and sex groups. We finally performed a larger meta-analysis GWAS of MVP, FinnGen, and the MGB Biobank, totalling 916,696 individuals. MVP participants are 91% male. OSA prevalence is 21%. In MVP there were 18 and 6 genome-wide significant loci in BMI-unadj and BMI-adj analyses, respectively, corresponding to 21 association regions. Of these, 17 were not previously reported in association with OSA, and 13 replicated in FinnGen (False Discovery Rate p-value < 0.05). There were widespread significant differences in genetic effects between men and women, but less so across HARE groups. Meta-analysis of MVP, FinnGen, and MGB biobank revealed 17 additional, previously unreported, genome-wide significant regions. Sex differences in genetic associations with OSA are widespread, likely associated with multiple OSA risk factors.

FinnGen,36529488,Mendelian Randomization Study Does Not Support a Bidirectional Link between Atherosclerosis and Venous Thromboembolism.,"Some observational studies suggested that atherosclerosis increased the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and vice versa. However, the results were conflicting, and the causal relationship is yet to be established. Therefore, we applied Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess the bidirectional causality between coronary heart disease (CHD) and VTE, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). A total of 184,305 individuals with CHD were included from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium. Information on VTE, DVT, and PE were obtained from the FinnGen biobank. Genetic instruments for CHD and VTE were constructed using 37 and 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, respectively. Inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis under a random-effect model was used as the preliminary estimate. Five complementary MR methods were also used, including weighted median, MR-Egger, multivariable MR (adjusted for the body mass index), simple mode, and weighted mode methods. The genetically instrumented VTE (odds ratio [OR]: 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.11; P=0.06), DVT (OR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.99-1.08; P=0.19), or PE (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.98-1.16; P=0.11) showed no causal relationships with CHD. There was also no clear evidence showing the causal effects of CHD on VTE (OR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.82-1.22; P=0.98), DVT (OR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.79-1.27; P=0.97), or PE (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.82-1.18; P=0.87). No pleiotropic bias was found in the MR analyses. As heterogeneity was significant, a random model was used to minimize the effect of heterogeneity.

FinnGen,36741373,Impact of ankylosing spondylitis on stroke limited to specific subtypes: Evidence from Mendelian randomization study.,"The relationship between Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and the risk of stroke is complex. Therefore, we utilized Two-Sample Mendelian randomization to examine the probable causal link between these two features. The genetic instruments linked to AS were chosen from a summary-level genetic data set from the FinnGen consortium in people of European ancestry (1462 cases and 164,682 controls). Stroke and its subtypes were selected as outcomes, and the MEGASTROKE consortium population was used to identify the genetic associations of AS on stroke (40,585 cases and 406,111 controls), ischemic stroke (IS) (34,217 cases and 406,111 controls), and its subtypes including large artery stroke (LAS) (4373 cases and 146,392 controls), small vessel stroke (SVS) (5386 cases and 192,662 controls), and cardioembolic stroke (CES) (7193 cases and 204,570 controls). Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (1687 cases and 201,146 controls) data set from the FinnGen consortium was also used. To obtain the casual estimates, the inverse variant weighted (IVW) method was mainly used. By examining the heterogeneity and pleiotropy of particular single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the robustness of the results was also examined. There was no evidence found to prove the correlation between genetically predicted AS and stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.014; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.999-1.031; P = 0.063), ICH (OR 1.030; 95% CI 0.995-1.067; P = 0.090), and IS (OR 1.013; 95% CI 0. 998-1.030; P = 0.090). In terms of the different subtypes of IS, there was strong evidence of positive causal inferences on CES (OR 1.051; 95% CI 1.022-1.081; P = 0.001), and suggestive evidence of positive causal inferences on LAS (OR 1.042; 95% CI 1.003-1.082; P = 0.033), while it was not significant for SVS (OR 1.010; 95% CI 0.975-1.047; P = 0.563).

However, the causality between LSB/PA and musculoskeletal health remained unknown. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the causal relationships between LSB/PA and lower back pain (LBP), intervertebral disc disorder (IVDD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and bone mineral density (BMD) by using a two-sample Mendelian randomization method. The exposure data were obtained from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including the PA dataset (self-reported PA, n  =  377,234; accelerometer-assessed PA, n  = 91,084) and LSB dataset (n  =  422,218).

The causal relationships were estimated with inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median methods. Sensitivity analyses were performed with Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, and leave-one-out analysis to estimate the robustness of our findings. Genetically predicted leisure television watching increased the risk of LBP (OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.01; P = 8.23×10-9) and IVDD (OR  =  1.62, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.91; P  =  2.13 × 10-8).

FinnGen,36869294,Processing genome-wide association studies within a repository of heterogeneous genomic datasets.,"Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are based on the observation of genome-wide sets of genetic variants - typically single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) - in different individuals that are associated with phenotypic traits. Research efforts have so far been directed to improving GWAS techniques rather than on making the results of GWAS interoperable with other genomic signals; this is currently hindered by the use of heterogeneous formats and uncoordinated experiment descriptions. To practically facilitate integrative use, we propose to include GWAS datasets within the META-BASE repository, exploiting an integration pipeline previously studied for other genomic datasets that includes several heterogeneous data types in the same format, queryable from the same systems. We represent GWAS SNPs and metadata by means of the Genomic Data Model and include metadata within a relational representation by extending the Genomic Conceptual Model with a dedicated view. To further reduce the gap with the descriptions of other signals in the repository of genomic datasets, we perform a semantic annotation of phenotypic traits. Our pipeline is demonstrated using two important data sources, initially organized according to different data models: the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog and FinnGen (University of Helsinki). The integration effort finally allows us to use these datasets within multi-sample processing queries that respond to important biological questions. These are then made usable for multi-omic studies together with, e.g., somatic and reference mutation data, genomic annotations, epigenetic signals. As a result of the our work on GWAS datasets, we enable 1) their interoperable use with several other homogenized and processed genomic datasets in the context of the META-BASE repository; 2) their big data processing by means of the GenoMetric Query Language and associated system.

We aimed to explore the causal effect of VAT on PE risks and the mediation role of age at menarche (AAM) in explaining this relationship. Summary data for PE were obtained from the FinnGen genome-wide association study (3556 cases and 114 735 controls). For exposure data, 70 genetic variants associated with the predicted VAT in 161 149 European women from UK Biobank were used as instrumental variables. Inverse variance weighted and multiple sensitivity analyses were applied. We also conducted multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to test the association between VAT-associated single-nucleotide variations and PE. Next, mediation analyses were performed to study whether the association between VAT and PE was mediated via AAM. In univariable MR analysis, higher volume of VAT was associated with the advancement of AAM and increased PE risk (beta = -0.33; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.16 for AAM; odds ratio 1.65, 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.20 for PE). After adjusting for waist circumference, waist to hip ratio, and hip circumference, the multivariable MR results presented the consistent positive causality of VAT on PE.

The PHN dataset obtained from FinnGen biobank had 195,191 individuals with 16,380,406 SNPs. Our findings from two different datasets of IL-18 protein levels suggest a correlation between genetically predicted elevations in IL-18 protein levels and an increased susceptibility to PHN.(IVW, OR and 95% CI: 2.26, 1.07 to 4.78; p = 0.03 and 2.15, 1.10 to 4.19; p =0.03, respectively), potentially indicating a causal effect of IL-18 protein levels increasing on PHN risk. However, we did not detect any causal effect of genetic liability to PHN risk on IL-18 protein levels. These findings suggest new insights into identifying IL-18 protein levels increasing at risk of developing PHN and may aid in the development of novel prevention and treatment approaches for PHN.",Frontiers in immunology,2023,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Interleukin-18; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Neuralgia, Postherpetic; Quality of Life",False,7

To examine the causal relationship between GM and ON, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Up to 18,340 samples of 24 population-based cohorts were included in genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 196 GM taxa. ON outcomes were selected from the FinnGen GWAS (951 ON cases and 307,092 controls). In addition, the GWAS based on UK Biobank (UKB) (105 ON cases and 456,243 controls) was used for further exploration. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) was carried out to estimate their effects on ON risk and the MR assumptions were evaluated in sensitivity analyses. Among the 196 GM taxa, the IVW results confirmed that Family -Peptococcaceae (P = 2.17 × 10 Our MR findings support the causal effect of specific GM taxa on ON.

In this study, we aimed to systematically assess the causal relationship of leukocyte telomere length (LTL) with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using a Mendelian randomization study. LTL (n=472174) was obtained from the UK Biobank genome-wide association study pooled data. AS (n=229640), RA (n=212472) were obtained from FinnGen database. MR-Egger, inverse variance weighting, and weighted median methods were used to estimate the effects of causes. Cochran's Q test, MR Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO, leave-one-out analysis, and funnel plots were used to look at sensitivity, heterogeneity, and multiple effects. Forward MR analysis considered LTL as the exposure and AS, RA as the outcome. Reverse MR analysis considered AS, RA as the exposure and LTL as the outcome. In the forward MR analysis, inverse variance-weighted and weighted median analysis results indicated that longer LTL might be associated with increased risk of AS (IVW: OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.14-2.11, p = 0.006). MR Egger regression analysis showed no pleiotropy between instrumental variables (IVs) (Egger intercept= 0.008, p = 0.294). The leave-one-out analysis showed that each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of AS was robust to each outcome. No significant causal effects were found between AS, RA and LTL in the reverse MR analysis.

FinnGen,36540997,Predictive models for abdominal aortic aneurysms using polygenic scores and PheWAS-derived risk factors.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are common enlargements of the abdominal aorta which can grow larger until rupture, often leading to death. Detection of AAA is often by ultrasonography and screening recommendations are mostly directed at men over 65 with a smoking history. Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified genetic loci associated with AAA risk. We combined known risk factors, polygenic risk scores (PRS) and precedent clinical diagnoses from electronic health records (EHR) to develop predictive models for AAA, and compared performance against screening recommendations. The PRS included genome-wide summary statistics from the Million Veteran Program and FinnGen (10,467 cases, 378,713 controls of European ancestry), with optimization in Vanderbilt's BioVU and validated in the eMERGE Network, separately across both White and Black participants. Candidate diagnoses were identified through a temporally-oriented Phenome-wide association study in independent EHR data from Vanderbilt, and features were selected via elastic net. We calculated C-statistics in eMERGE for models including PRS, phecodes, and covariates using regression weights from BioVU. The AUC for the full model in the test set was 0.883 (95% CI 0.873-0.892), 0.844 (0.836-0.851) for covariates only, 0.613 (95% CI 0.604-0.622) when using primary USPSTF screening criteria, and 0.632 (95% CI 0.623-0.642) using primary and secondary criteria. Brier scores were between 0.003 and 0.023 for our models indicating good calibration, and net reclassification improvement over combined primary and secondary USPSTF criteria was 0.36-0.60. We provide PRS for AAA which are strongly associated with AAA risk and add to predictive model performance. These models substantially improve identification of people at risk of a AAA diagnosis compared with existing guidelines, with evidence of potential applicability in minority populations.",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

In this study, we explored the causal link between systemic inflammatory regulators and POI risk using a bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) strategy. This approach utilized the most extensive genome-wide association study involving 41 systemic inflammatory regulators in a sample of 8,293 Finnish individuals and POI data from the FinnGen consortium (254 cases vs. 118,228 controls). The inverse variance weighting approach served as a primary MR method, and four additional MR techniques (Maximum Likelihood, MR-Egger, Weighted Median, and constrained maximum likelihood and model averaging Bayesian information criterion ) were applied to support and validate results. Cochran's Q statistics were used to assess the heterogeneity of instrumental variables, whereas the MR-Egger and MR Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier tests detected horizontal pleiotropy. The MR Steiger test evaluated the strength of a causal association. Our findings suggest that lower levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.99, P = 0.046) and interleukin-10 (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.33-0.85, P = 0.021) are associated with an increased risk of POI. Reverse MR analysis revealed no significant effect of POI on the expression of these 41 systemic inflammatory regulators. No notable heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy was observed in the instrumental variables. This study revealed a causal association between 41 systemic inflammatory regulators and POI, demonstrating that decreased levels of VEGF and IL-10 are linked to an elevated risk of POI.

However, the mechanisms and extent through which these loci contribute to subsequent outcomes remain elusive. We hypothesized that combinations of T2D-associated variants acting on tissue-specific regulatory elements might account for greater risk for tissue-specific outcomes, leading to diversity in T2D disease progression. We searched for T2D-associated variants acting on regulatory elements and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in nine tissues. We used T2D tissue-grouped variant sets as genetic instruments to conduct 2-Sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) in ten related outcomes whose risk is increased by T2D using the FinnGen cohort. We performed PheWAS analysis to investigate whether the T2D tissue-grouped variant sets had specific predicted disease signatures. We identified an average of 176 variants acting in nine tissues implicated in T2D, and an average of 30 variants acting on regulatory elements that are unique to the nine tissues of interest. In 2-Sample MR analyses, all subsets of regulatory variants acting in different tissues were associated with increased risk of the ten secondary outcomes studied on similar levels. No tissue-grouped variant set was associated with an outcome significantly more than other tissue-grouped variant sets.

Genotype data in human samples from before and after the Black Death, an epidemic due to Yersinia pestis, have marked changes in allele frequency of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2549794, with the T allele suggested to be deleterious during this period, while ERAP2 is also implicated in autoimmune diseases. This study explored the association between variation at ERAP2 and (1) infection, (2) autoimmune disease, and (3) parental longevity. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of these outcomes were identified in contemporary cohorts (UK Biobank, FinnGen, and GenOMICC). Effect estimates were extracted for rs2549794 and rs2248374, a haplotype tagging SNP. Additionally, cis expression and protein quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for ERAP2 were used in Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Consistent with decreased survival in the Black Death, the T allele of rs2549794 showed evidence of association with respiratory infection (odds ratio; OR for pneumonia 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.05). Effect estimates were larger for more severe phenotypes (OR for critical care admission with pneumonia 1.08; 95% CI 1.02-1.14). In contrast, opposing effects were identified for Crohn disease (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.82-0.90). This allele was shown to associate with decreased ERAP2 expression and protein levels, independent of haplotype. MR analyses suggest that ERAP2 expression may be mediating disease associations.

Therefore, our study aimed to explore the causalities between T1DM and six high-frequency infections using a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. Two-sample MR studies were conducted to explore the causalities between T1DM and six high-frequency infections: sepsis, acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs), intestinal infections (IIs), infections of the genitourinary tract (GUTIs) in pregnancy, infections of the skin and subcutaneous tissues (SSTIs), and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Data on summary statistics for T1DM and infections were obtained from the European Bioinformatics Institute database, the United Kingdom Biobank, FinnGen biobank, and Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit.

After adjusting for BMI and HbA1c, MVMR-IVW (OR=1.0942; 95% CI: 1.0666-1.1224, p<0.0001) showed significant outcomes that were consistent with those of LASSO regression and MVMR-Robust. However, no significant causal relationship was found between T1DM and sepsis susceptibility, ALRI susceptibility, GUTI susceptibility in pregnancy, SSTI susceptibility, and UTI susceptibility. Our MR analysis genetically predicted increased susceptibility to IIs in T1DM. However, no causality between T1DM and sepsis, ALRIs, GUTIs in pregnancy, SSTIs, or UTIs was found.

FinnGen,37556814,Genetic Evidence Strongly Supports Managing Weight and Blood Pressure in Addition to Glycemic Control in Preventing Vascular Complications in People With Type 2 Diabetes.,"To investigate the causal association of type 2 diabetes and its components with risk of vascular complications independent of shared risk factors obesity and hypertension and to identify the main driver of this risk. We conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) using independent genetic variants previously associated with type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose, HbA1c, fasting insulin, BMI, and systolic blood pressure as instrumental variables. We obtained summary-level data for 18 vascular diseases (15 for type 2 diabetes) from FinnGen and publicly available genome-wide association studies as our outcomes. We conducted univariable and multivariable MR, in addition to sensitivity tests to detect and minimize pleiotropic effects. Univariable MR analysis showed that type 2 diabetes was associated with 9 of 15 outcomes; BMI and systolic blood pressure were associated with 13 and 15 of 18 vascular outcomes, respectively; and fasting insulin was associated with 4 and fasting glucose with 2. No robust association was found for HbA1c instruments. With adjustment for correlated traits in the multivariable test, BMI and systolic blood pressure, consistent causal effects were maintained, while five associations with type 2 diabetes (chronic kidney disease, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage) were attenuated to null. Our findings add strong evidence to support the importance of BMI and systolic blood pressure in the development of vascular complications in people with type 2 diabetes. Such findings strongly support the need for better weight and blood pressure management in type 2 diabetes, independent of glucose lowering, to limit important complications.",Diabetes care,2023,"Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Blood Pressure; Glycated Hemoglobin; Genome-Wide Association Study; Glycemic Control; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Risk Factors; Cardiovascular Diseases; Insulin; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8
FinnGen,36726022,Evidence of a causal effect of genetic tendency to gain muscle mass on uterine leiomyomata.,"Uterine leiomyomata (UL) are the most common tumours of the female genital tract and the primary cause of surgical removal of the uterus. Genetic factors contribute to UL susceptibility. To add understanding to the heritable genetic risk factors, we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of UL in up to 426,558 European women from FinnGen and a previous UL meta-GWAS. In addition to the 50 known UL loci, we identify 22 loci that have not been associated with UL in prior studies. UL-associated loci harbour genes enriched for development, growth, and cellular senescence. Of particular interest are the smooth muscle cell differentiation and proliferation-regulating genes functioning on the myocardin-cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A pathway. Our results further suggest that genetic predisposition to increased fat-free mass may be causally related to higher UL risk, underscoring the involvement of altered muscle tissue biology in UL pathophysiology. Overall, our findings add to the understanding of the genetic pathways underlying UL, which may aid in developing novel therapeutics.",Nature communications,2023,Female; Humans; Uterine Neoplasms; Genome-Wide Association Study; Leiomyoma; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Muscular Diseases; Muscles,False,8
FinnGen,37464328,Leisure sedentary behaviour increases the risk of venous thromboembolism: a Mendelian randomisation study.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a substantial contributor to the global burden of disease. Observational studies have suggested that leisure sedentary behaviours (LSB) are related to the risk of VTE; however, the causal role of LSB in VTE remains unclear. Using data obtained from genome-wide association studies in the UK Biobank (N = 422,218), we identified 84, 21, and 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to sedentary television (TV) watching, computer use, and driving, respectively. These SNPs were employed as instrumental variables. Summary statistics for SNP-VTE associations was obtained from the FinnGen study (5,403 cases and 130,235 controls). Two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses were performed using inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger,weighted median, and weighted mode approaches. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure robustness of the results. The main IVW approach demonstrated a positive association between the genetically predicted sedentary TV watching and the risk of VTE [odds ratio (OR):1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.02-1.80, P = 0.039]. However, no significant association was observed for genetically predicted sedentary computer use or driving and VTE risk. The results from our series of sensitivity analyses, including Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, and MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier method, further supported these findings. This study provides evidence of an association between genetically predicted sedentary TV watching and the risk of VTE.

Six different Mendelian randomization (MR) Methods, including Inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, Simple mode, MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier methods (MR-PRESSO), Weighted mode and Weighted median were used to Two-Sample MR analysis. IVW was used as the primary estimate. Sensitivity analyses were examined via four aspects (Cochran's Q-test, MR Egger intercept analysis, Funnel plot and Leave-one-out sensitivity test). The OR of hypothyroidism on lung cancer was 0.918 (95% CI, 0.859-0.982; p = 0.013) in MR analysis with IVW method. No evidence for effects of hyperthyroidism, TSH and FT4 on lung cancer risk was found via six MR methods. Meanwhile, there was no evidence for effects of lung cancer on hypothyroidism through six MR methods. Lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung carcinoma were further analyzed on the basis of lung cancer. The OR of hypothyroidism on lung adenocarcinoma was 0.893(95% CI, 0.813-0.981; p = 0.019), the OR of hypothyroidism on squamous cell lung cancer was 0.888(95%CI,0.797-0.990, p = 0.032) in MR analysis with IVW method.

FinnGen,37840448,Associations of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cirrhosis with liver cancer in European and East Asian populations: A Mendelian randomization study.,"The positive relationships of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cirrhosis with liver cancer were shown in previous observational studies, while further Mendelian randomization (MR) investigations are needed to confirm the possible causal associations. This study aimed to explore whether NAFLD and cirrhosis were causally related to liver cancer using MR in European and East Asian populations. For European populations, NAFLD data were obtained from a genome-wide meta-analysis (8434 patients and 770 180 controls). The data on chronic elevation of alanine aminotransferase (cALT), a proxy of NAFLD, were derived from Million Veteran Program (68 725 patients and 95 472 controls). Cirrhosis data were collected from two sources: a genome-wide association study of five cohorts (4829 patients and 72 705 controls) and FinnGen (1931 patients and 216 861 controls). Liver cancer data were collected from FinnGen (304 patients and 174 006 controls). For East Asian populations, the data on cirrhosis (2184 patients and 210 269 controls) and hepatocellular carcinoma (1866 patients and 195 745 controls) were obtained from Biobank Japan. Three, 41, seven, six, and three single-nucleotide polymorphisms were used for NAFLD (European), cALT (European), cirrhosis (European-five cohorts), cirrhosis (European-FinnGen), and cirrhosis (East Asian), respectively. We used inverse-variance weighted as the primary method to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Among European populations, genetically-predicted NAFLD, cALT, cirrhosis (five cohorts), and cirrhosis (FinnGen) were positively associated with liver cancer, with ORs (95% CIs) of 6.62 (3.81-11.50) (p < .001), 2.59 (1.70-3.94) (p < .001), 3.38 (2.41-4.75) (p < .001), and 2.62 (1.20-5.72) (p = .015). Among East Asian populations, there was also a positive association between genetically-predicted cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.78-2.52; p < .001).

The causal effects of diabetes on the development of several malignancies have been established, but the reverse causation of these two diseases (e.g., what type of cancer can cause T2D) has been less investigated. Multiple Mendelian randomization (MR) methods, such as the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, weighted median method, MR-Egger, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier test, were performed to evaluate the causal association of overall and eight site-specific cancers with diabetes risk using genome-wide association study summary data from different consortia, such as Finngen and UK biobank.

FinnGen,37700350,Causal effect of body mass index and physical activity on the risk of joint sports injuries: Mendelian randomization analysis in the European population.,"Observational studies can suggest potential associations between variables but cannot establish a causal effect on their own. This study explored the causal associations between body mass index (BMI), physical activity (PA), and joint sports injuries. We conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using publicly accessed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets to investigate the causal effects of BMI and PA on joint sports injury risk. The inverse-variance weighted method was believed to be the primary MR analysis. Subsequently, sensitivity, pleiotropy, and heterogeneity analyses were employed to estimate the reliability of the results of the current research. Genetically predicted increased BMI was causally related to the higher sports injury risk of the ankle-foot (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09-1.37, p = 4.20E-04), knee (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.21-1.43, p = 1.57E-11), and shoulder (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.08-1.40, p = 1.28E-03). Further, the mentioned effects were validated using another set of GWAS data on BMI. Similar causal linkages were exhibited between increased BMI and the growing risk of sports injuries of the ankle-foot (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.13-1.60, p = 9.51E-04), knee (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09-1.45, p = 1.63E-03), and shoulder (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09-1.67, p = 5.66E-03). Additionally, accelerometer-based PA measurement (overall average acceleration) (AccAve) was negatively related to sports injuries of the ankle-foot (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-0.99, p = 0.046) and lumbar spine (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51-0.92, p = 0.012). Furthermore, we verified that the effect of AccAve on the risk of injury at the ankle-foot still had statistical significance after adjusting BMI. Results were verified as reliable under all sensitive analyses. This research determined that a higher BMI could raise the sports injury risk of the ankle-foot, knee, and shoulder, while an overall average acceleration PA could reduce the injury risk of the ankle-foot and lumbar spine. These conclusions contribute to a greater knowledge of the roles of BMI and PA in the mechanism of joint sports injuries and offer several suggestions for patients and clinicians.",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,2023,Humans; Athletic Injuries; Body Mass Index; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Reproducibility of Results; Exercise,False,8

We performed two-sample and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the potential causal role of the urinary sodium-potassium ratio in upper urinary calculi. Data of the urinary sodium-potassium ratio (N = 326,938), upper urinary calculi (N = 337,199), and confounding factors including BMI (N = 336,107), ever-smoke (N = 461,066), hypertension (N = 218,754), diabetes (N = 218,792), and alcohol intake frequency (N = 462,346) were obtained from the IEU OpenGWAS Project database. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger methods were used to estimate MR effects. The MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran's Q test, MR-PRESSO, leave-one-out method, and funnel plot were used for sensitivity analysis. A causal relationship was found between the urinary sodium-potassium ratio and upper urinary calculi (OR = 1.008, 95% CI = 1.002-1.013, P = 0.011). FinnGen data supported this conclusion (OR = 2.864, 95% CI = 1.235-6.641, P = 0.014). The multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis result showed that after adjusting for the effects of five confounders, the urinary sodium-potassium ratio was still positively correlated with upper urinary calculi (OR = 1.005, 95% CI = 1.001-1.009, P = 0.012). This study demonstrated a positive causal association between the urinary sodium-potassium ratio and upper urinary calculi using MR analysis.

FinnGen,36791018,Maladaptive Neuroplasticity in Corticospinal Tract after Ankle Sprain: Causal Links Established by Mendelian Randomization.,"It has been hypothesized that the corticospinal tract (CST) is involved in the neural origins underlying muscular deficits after an ankle sprain. Microstructural differences in the CST have been reported in patients with and without a history of ankle sprain, but the causal links between the CST and the injuries have not been verified. This study aimed to explore whether genetically predisposed ankle sprains would impair the integrity and organization of CST neurites, manifesting as reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased orientation dispersion index (ODI). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with ankle sprains were identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in FinnGen based on hospital discharge records (7223 cases and 245,598 controls). Outcome statistics for CST microstructures were collected from the GWAS from diffusion-weighted-imaging outcomes in the UK Biobank (33,224 participants). Random-effect, inverse-variance weighted Mendelian randomization was used as the primary method. Eighteen SNP were selected as forming possible causal links between ankle sprains and CST structure; F value ranged from 755 to 1026. Ankle sprains were associated with a reduction in the FA of the right CST ( β = -0.033, P = 0.0439), whereas no significant effects were observed on the left side ( β = -0.029, 0.004; P = 0.0748). Ankle sprains significantly increased the ODI of the left CST ( β = 0.053, P = 0.0036) and the right CST ( β = 0.038, P = 0.0259).

The genetic instruments of MetS and its five components (waist circumference [WC], hypertension, fasting blood glucose [FBG], triglycerides [TG], and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]) were obtained from public genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Outcome datasets for psoriasis were collected from the FinnGen Biobank Analysis Consortium. The main method was inverse variance weighting, complemented by sensitivity approaches to rectify potential pleiotropy. MetS, WC, and hypertension increase the risk of psoriasis (MetS, odd ratios [OR] = 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.27, p = 1.23e-04; WC, OR = 1.65, 95% CI  1.42-1.93, p = 1.06e-10; hypertension, OR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.33-3.07, p = 0.0009). In the reverse analysis, no causal association between psoriasis and MetS and its five components was identified.

FinnGen,37751459,Functional characterization of a single nucleotide polymorphism associated with Alzheimer's disease in a hiPSC-based neuron model.,"Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a group of debilitating conditions resulting from progressive nerve cell death. Of these, Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs most frequently, but is currently incurable and has limited treatment success. Late onset AD, the most common form, is highly heritable but is caused by a combination of non-genetic risk factors and many low-effect genetic variants whose disease-causing mechanisms remain unclear. By mining the FinnGen study database of phenome-wide association studies, we identified a rare variant, rs148726219, enriched in the Finnish population that is associated with AD risk and dementia, and appears to have arisen on a common haplotype with older AD-associated variants such as rs429358. The rs148726219 variant lies in an overlapping intron of the FosB proto-oncogene (FOSB) and ERCC excision repair 1 (ERCC1) genes. To understand the impact of this SNP on disease phenotypes, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 editing in a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line to generate isogenic clones harboring heterozygous and homozygous alleles of rs148726219. hiPSC clones differentiated into induced excitatory neurons (iNs) did not exhibit detectable molecular or morphological variation in differentiation potential compared to isogenic controls. However, global transcriptome analysis showed differential regulation of nearby genes and upregulation of several biological pathways related to neuronal function, particularly synaptogenesis and calcium signaling, specifically in mature iNs harboring rs148726219 homozygous and heterozygous alleles. Functional differences in iN circuit maturation as measured by calcium imaging were observed across genotypes. Edited mature iNs also displayed downregulation of unfolded protein response and cell death pathways. This study implicates a phenotypic impact of rs148726219 in the context of mature neurons, consistent with its identification in late onset AD, and underscores a hiPSC-based experimental model to functionalize GWAS-identified variants.",PloS one,2023,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genotype; Neurons",False,8
FinnGen,37480221,"The causal relationship of depression, anxiety, and neuroticism with main indicators of sarcopenia: A Mendelian randomization study.","Observational studies have shown the relationship between sarcopenia and psychiatric disorders. However, due to the limitations of traditional research methods, the causal relationship between them has not been accurately concluded. At the same time, considering that sarcopenia is mainly manifested by low muscle strength and low muscle mass, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis in this study to explore the causal relationship of anxiety, depression, and neuroticism with muscle strength and muscle mass, respectively. Genetic variants associated with depression were obtained from FinnGen Biobank (Ncase = 33,812, Ncontrol = 271,380), those associated with anxiety were from FinnGen Biobank (Ncase = 21,519, Ncontrol = 307,558), and those associated with neuroticism, including 12 items, were from a large-scale genome-wide association study (N range: 366,301-375,913). Muscle strength was represented by the hand grip strength (HGS), and muscle mass was represented by the appendicular lean mass (ALM) and the body fat percentage. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary analysis method, and the Mendelian Randomization Egger (MR-Egger) and the weighted median were used as supplementary methods to test whether the three psychological factors were causally related to these two main indicators of sarcopenia severity. Depression and neuroticism had different degrees of causal influence on muscle mass and strength, which was statistically significant. Specifically, the depression predicted by genes was significantly associated with ALM (beta = -0.043, p = 0.027), low hand grip strength (LHGS, measured for people of 60 years and older) (odds ratio (OR) = 1.129 (1.019-1.251), p = 0.019), right HGS (beta = -0.050, p = 0.001), left HGS (beta = -0.06, p = 0.001), and body fat percentage (beta = 0.035, p = 0.0138). The neuroticism predicted by genes was significantly associated with ALM (beta = -0.073, p = 0.034), LHGS (OR = 1.222 (1.085-1.377), p = 0.001), right HGS (beta = -0.058, p = 0.000), left HGS (beta = -0.080, p < 0.000), and body fat percentage (beta = 0.063, p = 0.008). However, anxiety was only significantly associated with LHGS (OR = 1.215 (1.008-1.465), p = 0.041) but not significantly associated with ALM (beta = 0.033, p = 0.313), right HGS (beta = -0.008, p = 0.678), left HGS (beta = 0.007, p = 0.712), or body fat percentage (beta = 0.022, p = 0.559). This study supported the causal association of depression and neuroticism with muscle strength and mass, which are the two main indicators of sarcopenia. At the same time, there was no sufficient evidence for the causal relationship between anxiety and muscle strength or mass.

Genomic Structural Equation Modelling identified a latent genetic factor underlying disorders, accounting for their significant genetic correlations. SNPs significantly associated with both latent factor and depression were identified. Excellent model fit existed between a latent factor underlying five reproductive disorders (χ2 (5) = 6.4; AIC = 26.4; CFI = 1.00; SRMR = 0.03) with high standardised loadings for menorrhagia (0.96, SE = 0.05); ovarian cysts (0.94, SE = 0.05); endometriosis (0.83, SE = 0.05); menopausal symptoms (0.77, SE = 0.10); and uterine fibroids (0.65, SE = 0.05). This latent factor was genetically correlated with PND (rG = 0.37, SE = 0.15, p = 1.4e-03), depression in females only (rG = 0.48, SE = 0.06, p = 7.2e-11), and depression in both males and females (MD) (rG = 0.35, SE = 0.03, p = 1.8e-30), with its top locus associated with FSHB/ARL14EP (rs11031006; p = 9.1e-33). SNPs intronic to ESR1, significantly associated with the latent factor, were also associated with PND, female depression, and MD. A common genetic factor, correlated with depression, underlies risk of reproductive disorders, with implications for aetiology and treatment. Genetic variation in ESR1 is associated with reproductive disorders and depression, highlighting the importance of oestrogen signalling for both reproductive and mental health.",Neuroendocrinology,2023,Pregnancy; Humans; Male; Female; Depression; Genome-Wide Association Study; Reproduction; Risk Factors; Comorbidity,False,9
FinnGen,37910257,Causal relationships between circulating inflammatory cytokines and diffuse large B cell lymphoma: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Studies indicated that inflammatory cytokines involved in the occurrence and progression of DLBCL and it is challenging to discern causality from the effects due to the presence of feedback loops. We conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the potential causal relationship between DLBCL and inflammatory cytokines. The genetic variants associated with inflammatory cytokines were obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 8293 European participants, and the data on 1010 individuals with DLBCL were sourced from the FinnGen consortium. The primary method employed in this study was the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, with supplementary analyses conducted using the MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO approaches. Based on the IVW method, genetically predicted that increasing level of Monokine induced by interferon gamma (MIG/CXC chemokine ligand 9, CXCL9) [OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.05-1.62; P = 0.01] and interferon gamma-induced protein 10(IP-10/CXC chemokine ligand 10, CXCL10) [OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.02-1.66; P = 0.03] showed suggestive associations with DLBCL risk. DLBCL may increase the level of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) [OR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.01-1.2; P = 0.03], tumor necrosis factor beta (TNF-β) [OR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.02-1.31; P = 0.02] and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) [OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01-1.13; P = 0.02]. This study presents evidence supporting a causal relationship between inflammation cytokines and DLBCL. Specifically, MIG/CXCL9 and IP-10/CXCL10 were identified as indicators of upstream causes of DLBCL; while, DLBCL itself was found to elevate the levels of M-CSF, TNF-β, and TRAIL. These findings suggest that targeting specific inflammatory factors through regulation and intervention could serve as a potential approach for the treatment and prevention of DLBCL.",Clinical and experimental medicine,2023,"Humans; Cytokines; Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Lymphotoxin-alpha; Interferon-gamma; Chemokine CXCL10; Genome-Wide Association Study; Ligands; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse",False,8

This study aimed to determine the causality of the associations of plasma phospholipid AA with NALFD, cirrhosis, and liver cancer using Mendelian randomization analysis. Nine independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with plasma phospholipid AA at the genome-wide significance were used as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for three outcomes were obtained from 1) a genome-wide association study for NAFLD, 2) the UK Biobank study, and 3) the FinnGen study. The sensitivity analysis excluding the pleiotropic variant rs174547 in the FADS1 gene was performed. Estimates from different sources were combined using the fixed-effects meta-analysis method. Per standard deviation increase in AA levels, the combined odds ratio was 1.06 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.11; P = 0.008) for NAFLD, 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.09; P = 0.009) for cirrhosis, and 0.99 (95% confidence interval, 0.94-1.05; P = 0.765) for liver cancer. The associations remained stable in the sensitivity analysis excluding rs174547. This study suggests potential causal associations of high levels of plasma phospholipid AA with the risk of NAFLD and cirrhosis.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2023,"Humans; Arachidonic Acid; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Liver Neoplasms; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Phospholipids; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors",False,2
FinnGen,38112721,Causal associations of Insomnia and postpartum depression: a two-sample mendelian randomization study.,"Postpartum depression (PPD), a prevalent social-mental condition, impacts the mother and the newborn and several facets of their lives. It has been suggested that insomnia is related to both the occurrence and progression of PPD. However, because of lingering confounding and bias, it is impossible to determine the cause of this connection using observational analysis. In this study, we evaluate the causal importance of insomnia on postpartum depression using Mendelian randomization (MR). Utilizing summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a two-sample MR study was conducted. A GWAS dataset of IEU study of the United Kingdom Biobank phenotypes comprising 462,341 people of European heritage yielded 38 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for insomnia. The PPD data were provided by the FinnGen project and comprised 7604 cases and 59,601 controls. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was utilized for the primary MR analysis, with weighted median and MR-Egger as sensitivity analyses. As a result, we found that genetically predicted insomnia was positively associated with postpartum depression. The odds ratios (OR) of PPD were 1.849 (95% (confidence interval) CI 1.011-3.381; p = 0.046). For the first time, the causative role of sleeplessness for postpartum depression has been extensively evaluated in the current two-sample MR investigation.

Herein, we implemented a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationship between IBD and KSD. Data on IBD and KSD were obtained from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) summary statistics and the FinnGen consortium, respectively. Strict selection steps were used to screen for eligible instrumental SNPs. We applied inverse variance weighting (IVW) with the fix-effects model as the major method. Several sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Causal relationships between IBD and KSD were explored in two opposite directions. Furthermore, we carried out multivariable MR (MVMR) to obtain the direct causal effects of IBD on KSD. Our results demonstrated that CD could increase the risk of KSD (IVW: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03-1.10, p < 0.001). Similar results were found in the validation group (IVW: OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01-1.08, p = 0.013) and in the MVMR analysis. Meanwhile, no evidence of a causal association between UC and KSD was identified. The reverse MR analysis detected no causal association. This MR study verified that CD plays a critical role in developing kidney stones and that the effect of UC on KSD needs to be further explored.",BMC urology,2023,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Kidney Calculi; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Colitis, Ulcerative; Crohn Disease",False,5

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the use of sun/UV protection and ease of skin tanning were selected from the UK Biobank genome-wide association study database consisting of 498,751 European participants. SNPs of PXG were obtained from the FinnGen study including 3424 PXG cases and 326,434 controls. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to assess the association between the use of sun/UV protection and ease of skin tanning and risk of PXG. Inverse variance weighted regression of genetic susceptibility predicted that both use of sun/UV protection and ease of skin tanning were potentially positively associated with the decreased risk of PXG in the European ancestry (use of sun/UV protection: odds ratio [OR] = 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.92; P = 0.028; ease of skin tanning: OR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.97; P = 0.025).

FinnGen,38077385,New insight into the causal relationship between Graves' disease liability and drug eruption: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Graves' disease (GD) and drug eruption are closely associated and frequently observed in the clinical setting. However, it remains unclear whether a causal relationship exists between these two conditions. The aim of the study is to investigate whether GD is causal to drug eruptions using two-sample Mendelian randomization. We launched a two-sample MR to investigate whether GD is causal to drug eruption using Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data from Biobank Japan and FinnGen. Genetic variants were used as instrumental variables to avoid confounding bias. Statistical methods including inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO were conducted to identify the robustness of the causal effect. Genetically predicted GD may increase the risk of drug eruption by 30.3% (OR=1.303, 95% CI 1.119-1.516, p<0.001) in the Asian population. In European populations, GD may increase the generalized drug eruption by 15.9% (OR=1.159, 95%CI 0.982-1.367, p=0.080). We found GD is potentially causal to drug eruption.

FinnGen,36929174,GWAS meta-analyses clarify the genetics of cervical phenotypes and inform risk stratification for cervical cancer.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified associations for cervical cancer, but the underlying mechanisms of cervical biology and pathology remain uncharacterised. Our GWAS meta-analyses fill this gap, as we characterise the genetic architecture of cervical phenotypes, including cervical ectropion, cervicitis, cervical dysplasia, as well as up to 9229 cases and 490 304 controls for cervical cancer from diverse ancestries. Leveraging the latest computational methods and gene expression data, we refine the association signals for cervical cancer and propose potential causal variants and genes at each locus. We prioritise PAX8/PAX8-AS1, LINC00339, CDC42, CLPTM1L, HLA-DRB1 and GSDMB as the most likely candidate genes for cervical cancer signals, providing insights into cervical cancer pathogenesis and supporting the involvement of reproductive tract development, immune response and cellular proliferation/apoptosis. We construct a genetic risk score (GRS) that is associated with cervical cancer [hazard ratios (HR) = 3.1 (1.7-5.6) for the top 15% vs lowest 15% of individuals], and with other HPV- and immune-system-related diagnoses in a phenome-wide association study analysis.

FinnGen,38148419,Causal relationship between cigarette smoking behaviors and the risk of hernias: a Mendelian randomization study.,"As the global population continues to age, there is a noticeable yearly rise in the incidence of hernias. Simultaneously, smoking, a widespread addictive behavior and a significant contributor to mortality, has evolved into a pervasive public health concern. Existing literature has already established a connection between smoking and an increased risk of postoperative recurrence and postoperative infections following hernia surgery. However, there remains a dearth of research exploring the association between smoking and hernia morbidity. In this study, our objective is to systematically evaluate the causal relationship between cigarette smoking behaviors and hernia morbidity using a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. Hernia-related data were sourced from the FinnGen Biobank database, while cigarette smoking behavior data were gathered from the GWAS and Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine Use. To assess the causal relationship, we employed five methods: the weighted median, the weighted mode the inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and the simple mode. Sensitivity analysis was conducted, incorporating Cochran's Q test, the MR-Egger intercept test, leave-one-out analysis, and funnel plot. The presentation of the causal relationship is expressed as an odds ratio (OR) along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Employing the IVW method as the reference standard, we found that smoking intensity is associated with an increased risk of diaphragmatic hernia (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.00-1.46, P = 0.047). These consistent findings were further corroborated by the weighted median and weighted mode methods (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.03-1.54, P = 0.026; OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.52, P = 0.045). Conversely, when applying the IVW method, we identified no statistically significant causal relationship between smoking age, smoking initiation status, smoking cessation status, and the incidence of hernia. Our MR study has uncovered genetic evidence linking smoking intensity and the occurrence of diaphragmatic hernia. The risk of developing diaphragmatic hernia rises in tandem with the intensity of smoking. This emphasizes the crucial role of regularly advising patients to cease smoking in clinical settings.",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,2024,"Humans; Cigarette Smoking; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Herniorrhaphy; Hernia, Hiatal; Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital; Genome-Wide Association Study",False,8
FinnGen,37813992,A Mendelian randomization-based approach to explore the relationship between leukocyte counts and breast cancer risk in European ethnic groups.,"Exploring the potential association between peripheral blood leukocyte counts and breast cancer risk by Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis methods. Genetic data related to peripheral blood sorting counts of leukocytes were collected from a genome-wide association study by Blood Cell Consortium (BCX). Single nucleotide polymorphic loci predicting peripheral blood sorting counts of these leukocytes were selected as instrumental variables according to the correlation assumption, independence assumption and exclusivity assumption of MR. The data on breast cancer and its subtypes were obtained from Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) and FinnGen Consortium. In this study, the Inverse-Variance Weighted (IVW), Weighted Median, MR-Egger, Maximum Likelihood (ML), MR-PRESSO and Constrained Maximum Likelihood and Model Averaging (cML-MA) methods of random effects models were used for MR analysis. Cochran's Q analysis, and MR-Egger intercept analysis were applied for sensitivity analysis. IVW and cML-MA were considered the primary analytical tools, and the results of the other 4 MRs were used as complementary and validation. The results suggest that there is no significant causal relationship between leukocyte count and breast cancer risk (IVW OR = 0.98 [95% CI: 0.93-1.03], p-value = 0.35; CML-MA OR = 1.01 [95% CI: 0.98-1.05], p-value = 0.51).

Using publicly accessible genome-wide association study statistics, a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was carried out. In order to determine whether diabetes has a causal effect on osteonecrosis and whether osteonecrosis has a causal effect on diabetes, we extracted six date on diabetes in Europeans from IEU OpenGWAS and GWAS Catalogue and osteonecrosis in Europeans from FinnGen. We then evaluated the data using inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode. The results' stability and dependability were then evaluated using sensitivity analysis and heterogeneity analysis. Finally, meta-analysis is used to further confirm if there is a relationship between diabetes and osteonecrosis. When diabetes was used as an exposure factor, MR-Egger regression showed that directional fold product was unlikely to bias the results. Cochran's Q test showed only minor heterogeneity in a few data sets. Multidirectional tests Egger-intercept, MR-PRESSO and funnel plots for most data did not show multidirectional and asymmetry at the gene level. Most of the IVW results showed no causal relationship between diabetes mellitus and osteonecrosis. The results of meta-analysis of IVW methods further confirmed the absence of a causal relationship.

FinnGen,36947680,Associations of polygenic risk scores for preeclampsia and blood pressure with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.,"Preexisting hypertension increases risk for preeclampsia. We examined whether a generic blood pressure polygenic risk score (BP-PRS), compared with a preeclampsia-specific polygenic risk score (PE-PRS), could better predict hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Our study sample included 141 298 genotyped FinnGen study participants with at least one childbirth and followed from 1969 to 2021. We calculated PRSs for SBP and preeclampsia using summary statistics for greater than 1.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. We observed 8488 cases of gestational hypertension (GHT) and 6643 cases of preeclampsia. BP-PRS was associated with GHT [multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for 1SD increase in PRS (hazard ratio 1.38; 95% CI 1.35-1.41)] and preeclampsia (1.26, 1.23-1.29), respectively. The PE-PRS was also associated with GHT (1.16; 1.14-1.19) and preeclampsia (1.21, 1.18-1.24), but with statistically more modest magnitudes of effect (P = 0.01). The model c-statistic for preeclampsia improved when PE-PRS was added to clinical risk factors (P = 4.6 × 10-15). Additional increment in the c-statistic was observed when BP-PRS was added to a model already including both clinical risk factors and PE-PRS (P = 1.1 × 10-14). BP-PRS is strongly associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Our current observations suggest that the BP-PRS could capture the genetic architecture of preeclampsia better than the current PE-PRSs. These findings also emphasize the common pathways in the development of all BP disorders.

FinnGen,37495778,No evidence of genetic causal association between sex hormone-related traits and systemic lupus erythematosus: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Previous studies have demonstrated an association between sex hormone-related traits and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, because of the difficulties in determining sequential temporality, the causal association remains elusive. In this study, we used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the genetic causal associations between sex hormone-related traits and SLE. We used a two-sample MR to explore the causal association between sex hormone-related traits and SLE. The summarized data for sex hormone-related traits (including testosterone, estradiol (E2), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and bioavailable testosterone (BT)) originated from large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of European descent. Aggregated data for SLE were derived from the FinnGen consortium (835 cases and 300,162 controls). Random-effects inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, weighted mode, and fixed-effects IVW methods were used for the MR analysis. Random-effects IVW was the primary method used to analyze the genetic causal association between sex hormone-related traits and SLE. Heterogeneity of the MR results was detected using the IVW Cochran's Q estimates. The pleiotropy of MR results was detected using MR-Egger regression and the MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test. Finally, leave-one-out analysis was performed to determine whether MR results were affected by a single single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Random-effects IVW as the primary method showed that testosterone (odds ratio (OR), 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.41-1.82; P = 0.705), E2 (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.73-1.23; P = 0.693), SHBG (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.74-2.13; P = 0.400), and BT (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.67-1.47; P = 0.959) had no potential causal association with SLE. The MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, weighted mode, and fixed-effects IVW methods all indicated consistent results. The results of the MR-Egger regression showed that there was no pleiotropy in our MR analysis (P > 0.05). The IVW Cochran's Q estimates showed that the MR analysis results of E2, SHBG, and BT on SLE had no heterogeneity (P > 0.05), but testosterone and SLE had heterogeneity (P < 0.05). The leave-one-out analysis confirmed that a single SNP did not affect the MR results. Our MR analysis demonstrated that genetically predicted testosterone, E2, SHBG, and BT levels were not associated with SLE risk, but the roles of other non-genetic pathways cannot be ruled out. Key Points • This is the first MR study to explore the causal association of sex hormone-related traits with SLE. • No evidence to support causal associations between sex hormone-related traits and SLE. • Our MR analysis may provide novel insights into the causal association between sex hormone-related traits and SLE risk.",Clinical rheumatology,2023,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Testosterone; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic",False,7
FinnGen,36448979,Noncoding rare variants in PANX3 are associated with chronic back pain.,"Back pain is the leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide, yet surprisingly, little is known regarding the biology underlying this condition. The impact of genetics is known for chronic back pain: its heritability is estimated to be at least 40%. Large genome-wide association studies have shown that common variation may account for up to 35% of chronic back pain heritability; rare variants may explain a portion of the heritability not explained by common variants. In this study, we performed the first gene-based association analysis of chronic back pain using UK Biobank imputed data including rare variants with moderate imputation quality. We discovered 2 genes, SOX5 and PANX3 , influencing chronic back pain. The SOX5 gene is a well-known back pain gene. The PANX3 gene has not previously been described as having a role in chronic back pain. We showed that the association of PANX3 with chronic back pain is driven by rare noncoding intronic polymorphisms. This result was replicated in an independent sample from UK Biobank and validated using a similar phenotype, dorsalgia, from FinnGen Biobank.

A large number of evidences suggest that cytokines are associated with gestational duration and eye diseases. However, the causal relationships among cytokines, maternal gestational impairment and offspring eye diseases remain unclear. We performed lifecourse-network Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the causal relationships between maternal gestational duration (from the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) Consortium and the Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research (iPSYCH) study, N = 84,689), neonatal/adult cytokines (from the NHGRI-EBI Catalog, N = 764/4,618), and adult eye diseases (from FinnGen consotium, N = 309,154) using summary-level data from large genome-wide association studies. Multiplicative random effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) and multivariable-IVW methods were the main analysis methods, and the other 15 pleiotropy-robust methods, weak IV-robust methods, and outliers-robust methods were used as auxiliary methods. Maternal gestational age (early preterm birth, preterm birth, gestational duration, and post-term birth) had a causal relationship with 42 eye diseases. Four neonatal cytokines, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α(TNF-α), IL10, GROA, and CTACK, as well as four adult cytokines, CTACK, IL10, IL12p70 and IL6 are mediators in the causal relationships between early preterm birth and preterm birth in eight eye diseases. However, after adjusting for these mediators, a null direct causal effect of early preterm birth and preterm birth on eight eye diseases was found. In addition, there was no mediator in the causal relationship between gestational duration and post-term birth to eye diseases. The effects of maternal gestational duration on offspring eye diseases through cytokines are long-term and life-course effects.",International immunopharmacology,2023,"Infant, Newborn; Adult; Female; Humans; Cytokines; Premature Birth; Genome-Wide Association Study; Gestational Age; Interleukin-10; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Eye Diseases",False,8
FinnGen,37656706,Mendelian randomization study shows a causal effect of asthma on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk.,"This study was performed to explore the causal association between asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD). We obtained summary statistics for asthma from 408,442 Europeans in an open genome-wide association study (GWAS) from the UK Biobank to select strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms that could serve as instrumental variables for asthma (P < 5×10-8). Additional summary statistics for COPD were obtained from 193,638 individuals of European ancestry in the GWAS published by FinnGen. Univariable Mendelian randomization(UVMR) analysis was performed using inverse variance weighted (IVW) as the primary method of analysis. The reliability of the results was verified by multivariable MR(MVMR), reverse and replication MR analysis, and sensitivity analysis. In the UVMR analysis, asthma increased the risk of COPD, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.16-1.39, P = 5.44×10-7). Estimates were consistent in MVMR analyses by the adjustments of smoking initiation, age of smoking initiation, cigarettes per day, PM 2.5, and the combination of the above factors. In the reverse MR analysis, there was no evidence of a causal effect of COPD on asthma risk(OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.97-1.07, P = 0.3643). In the replication MR analysis, asthma still increased the risk of COPD. Sensitivity analyses validated the robustness of the above associations. We found that genetically predicted asthma was positively associated with the risk of COPD. Additionally, there was no evidence that COPD increases the risk of asthma. Further clarification of this link and underlying mechanisms is needed to identify feasible measures to promote COPD prevention.",PloS one,2023,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Asthma; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive",False,7

The cause-effect association was established using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Eligible single nucleotide polymorphisms were selected as instrumental variables from six FAs genome-wide association studies. The outcome involved a total of 260,428 subjects and was a summary of genetic data on PLC from FinnGen biobanks. The principal method inverse variance weighted (IVW) and several other analytical approaches (MR-Egger, Weighted Median, and Maximum likelihood) were tested to determine the causal relationship between different FAs and PLC. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the stability of the results. The two-sample MR analysis revealed a negative causal relationship between omega-3 FAs and PLC. It was discovered that an increase in each standard deviation (0.53 mmol/L; SD: 0.22) in the genetic levels of omega-3 FAs reduced the risk of PLC by 62.1% through the IVW method [odd ratio: 0.379; 95% confidence interval (0.176, 0.816)]. Nevertheless, other FAs were not statistically correlated with PLC. Additionally, no pleiotropy was found between the two.

We aimed to explore how sex hormones affect the association between 25(OH)D and osteoporosis to provide meaningful insights on the underlying mechanisms from a genetic perspective. Genetic variations in 25(OH)D, total testosterone (TT), androstenedione (A4), estradiol (E2), and testosterone/17β-estradiol (T/E2) were determined through summary statistics. Taking osteoporosis as the outcome (FinnGen biobank, 332,020 samples), we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to establish the association between 25(OH)D and these sex hormones. The two-step MR analysis quantified the mediatory effects of sex hormones on osteoporosis. The results were further verified by pleiotropy and heterogeneity analyses. MR results showed that 25(OH)D (OR= 1.27,  This study, through MR analysis, showed that TT mediates the causal effect of 25(OH)D on osteoporosis.

In order to investigate the possible causal relationships, we used a Mendelian randomization analysis. Data for generically predicted breast cancer were identified based on the BCAC consortium. A meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) comprising 1,500,861 participants for VTE as well as data from the FinnGen study for VTE, DVT and PE was used for the causal-effect estimation. Our primary method was inverse-variance weighted (IVW), and our supplementary methods included weighted median and MR-Egger. We also carried out sensitivity analysis for the study. No evidence of causal-effect was detected of overall breast cancer on VTE in both the GWAS meta-analysis (OR=1.01, 95%CI:0.98-1.04, p = 0.495) and the FinnGen consortium (OR=1.00,95%CI:0.96-1.04, p = 0.945). In addition, the presence of ER-positive or ER-negative disease did not significantly influence the incidence of VTE and its subtypes.

We utilised a two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) study to evaluate the potential causal association between 486 blood metabolites and SLE. Exposure data at the metabolite level were extracted from 7824 European Genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Preliminary analysis utilised SLE GWAS data from FinnGen. The primary method for causal analysis relied on random inverse variance weighting (IVW). To ensure robustness, sensitivity analyses included the Cochran Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO, and leave-one-out analysis. Steiger testing and linkage disequilibrium score regression were employed to validate the identified metabolites. This study identified 12 metabolites, comprising six known chemical structures: 1,5-anhydroglucitol(1,5-AG) [odds ratio (OR) = 0.100, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.015-0.773, P = 0.027), gamma-glutamylthreonine (OR = 0.077, 95% CI: 0.010-0.574, P = 0.012), 5-dodecenoate(12:1n7) (OR = 0.205, 95% CI: 0.061-0.685, P = 0.010), linoleoylglycerophosphoethanolamine * (OR = 0.159, 95% CI: 0.027-0.933, P = 0.044), erythrose (OR = 88.331,95% CI:1.098-63.214, P = 0.040) and 1-, adrenate (22:4n6) (OR = 9.876, 95% CI: 1.753-55.639, P = 0.001)].

FinnGen,37697398,Use of electronic health record data mining for heart failure subtyping.,"To assess whether electronic health record (EHR) data text mining can be used to improve register-based heart failure (HF) subtyping. EHR data of 43,405 individuals from two Finnish hospital biobanks were mined for unstructured text mentions of ejection fraction (EF) and validated against clinical assessment in two sets of 100 randomly selected individuals. Structured laboratory data was then incorporated for a categorization by HF subtype (HF with mildly reduced EF, HFmrEF; HF with preserved EF, HFpEF; HF with reduced EF, HFrEF; and no HF). In 86% of the cases, the algorithm-identified EF belonged to the correct HF subtype range. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the algorithm were 94-100% for HFrEF, 85-100% for HFmrEF, and 96%, 67%, 53% and 98% for HFpEF. Survival analyses using the traditional diagnosis of HF were in concordance with the algorithm-based ones. Compared to healthy individuals, mortality increased from HFmrEF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-2.95) to HFpEF (2.28; 1.80-2.88) to HFrEF group (2.63; 1.97-3.50) over a follow-up of 1.5 years.

FinnGen,38220361,Assessing the journey of calcium supplementation: A mendelian randomization study on the causal link between calcium levels and sleep disorders.,"Sleep disorder is a growing concern, and calcium supplementation is often recommended as a potential intervention for sleep disorders. However, the causal relationship between calcium levels and the incidence of sleep disorders remains unclear. Mendelian randomization techniques utilizing genetic variants that affect calcium levels, can provide valuable insights into causality. This study aims to examine the association between calcium levels and sleep disorders in a diverse population that includes both adolescents and adults, and investigate the effects of calcium levels on sleep disorders. Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted using data from UK Biobank and FinnGen datasets. The inverse-variance weighting (IVW) was selected as the primary method. In addition, traditional mediation analysis was performed on a subset of the NHANES data spanning from 2007 to 2018. Our findings provide evidence supporting a causal relationship between calcium intake and reduced risk of sleep disorders (beta = -0.079, SE = 0.0395, P = 0.0457). While not reaching statistical significance, other MR methods such as weighted median and Mr-Egger exhibited similar directional trends. Analysis of the NHANES cohort revealed a negative association between calcium levels and the prevalence of sleep disorders in male, black, and physically active populations. However, this association was not observed in other demographic groups. Our results suggested that there is no significant correlation between calcium levels and sleep disorder in non-exercise populations. This raises concerns about the long-term high-dose calcium supplementation in clinical practice, which requires further investigation.",Clinical nutrition ESPEN,2024,Adolescent; Adult; Humans; Male; Calcium; Dietary Supplements; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Nutrition Surveys; Sleep Wake Disorders; Female,False,0

This study was dedicated to investigate the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and intervertebral disc degeneration and the presence of potentially bacterial traits using two-sample Mendelian randomization. A two-sample Mendelian randomization study was performed using the summary statistics of the gut microbiota from the largest available genome-wide association study meta-analysis conducted by the MiBioGen consortium. Summary statistics of intervertebral disc degeneration were obtained from the FinnGen consortium R8 release data. Five basic methods and MR-PRESSO were used to examine causal associations. The results of the study were used to examine the causal association between gut microbiota and intervertebral disc degeneration. Cochran's Q statistics were used to quantify the heterogeneity of instrumental variables. By using Mendelian randomization analysis, 10 bacterial traits potentially associated with intervertebral disc degeneration were identified: genus Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group, genus Lachnoclostridium, unknown genus id.2755, genus Marvinbryantia, genus Ruminococcaceae UCG003, family Rhodospirillaceae, unknown genus id.959, order Rhodospirillales, genus Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 grou, genus Eubacterium brachy group. This Mendelian Randomization study found a causal effect between 10 gut microbiota and intervertebral disc degeneration, and we summarize the possible mechanisms of action in the context of existing studies.

The objective of this study is to investigate the causal relationship between 108 traits and GDM by employing a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to identify potential risk factors of GDM. We conducted MR analyses to explore the relationships between traits and GDM. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for traits were primarily based on data from the UK Biobank (UKBB), while the GWAS for GDM utilized data from FinnGen. We employed a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% to account for multiple comparisons. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method indicated that the genetically predicted 24 risk factors were significantly associated with GDM, such as ""Forced expiratory volume in 1-second (FEV1)"" (OR=0.76; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.92), ""Forced vital capacity (FVC)"" (OR=0.74; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.87), ""Usual walking pace"" (OR=0.19; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.39), ""Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)"" (OR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.94). The sensitivity analyses with MR-Egger and weighted median methods indicated consistent results for most of the trats.

FinnGen,37400992,Association of iron homeostasis biomarkers in type 2 diabetes and glycaemic traits: a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Mendelian randomization (MR) studies show iron positively associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) but included potentially biasing hereditary haemochromatosis variants and did not assess reverse causality. We assessed the relation of iron homeostasis with T2D and glycaemic traits bidirectionally, using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of iron homeostasis biomarkers [ferritin, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation (TSAT) (n ≤ 246 139)], T2D (DIAMANTE n = 933 970 and FinnGen n = 300 483), and glycaemic traits [fasting glucose (FG), 2-h glucose, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting insulin (FI) (n ≤ 209 605)]. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was the main analysis, supplemented with sensitivity analyses and assessment of mediation by hepcidin. Iron homeostasis biomarkers were largely unrelated to T2D, although serum iron was potentially associated with higher T2D [odds ratio: 1.07 per standard deviation; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99 to 1.16; P-value: 0.078) in DIAMANTE only. Higher ferritin, serum iron, TSAT and lower TIBC likely decreased HbA1c, but were not associated with other glycaemic traits. Liability to T2D likely increased TIBC (0.03 per log odds; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.05; P-value: 0.005), FI likely increased ferritin (0.29 per log pmol/L; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.47; P-value: 8.72 x 10-4). FG likely increased serum iron (0.06 per mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.12; P-value: 0.046). Hepcidin did not mediate these associations. It is unlikely that ferritin, TSAT and TIBC cause T2D although an association for serum iron could not be excluded.

Based on the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) recommendations for reporting secondary findings, BpG offered testing of specific actionable genes without additional charge for specimens submitted to WES diagnostics. Individuals could opt-in for a secondary findings analysis by using a separate electronic consent form. Data from BpG database of electronic consent forms was used for the analysis. During the selected study period there were 3263 WES referrals, from which 2012 were index patients. About half of the individuals (50.4%) opted in to receiving secondary findings. Of patients who opted in, a secondary finding was detected for 2.7%, similar to other studies. We detected huge differences relating to opt-in between individuals from different countries; for instance, 90% of the 41 patients and their family members in Romania opted to receive secondary findings, while none of the 98 patients in Luxembourg chose that option. Differences between sexes or between children and adults were small. This data offers one view to the interest of patients and family members to opt in to receiving secondary findings.

In this investigation, we aimed to quantify the value of genetic information in predicting IDA and Hb-deferral. We analysed genetic data from up to 665,460 participants of the FinnGen, Blood Service Biobank and UK Biobank, and used INTERVAL (N = 39,979) for validation. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of IDA and Hb-deferral and utilized publicly available genetic associations to compute polygenic scores for IDA, ferritin and Hb. We fitted models to estimate the effect sizes of these polygenic risk scores (PRSs) on IDA and Hb-deferral risk while accounting for the individual's age, sex, weight, height, smoking status and blood donation history. Significant variants in GWASs of IDA and Hb-deferral appear to be a small subset of variants associated with ferritin and Hb. Effect sizes of genetic predictors of IDA and Hb-deferral are similar to those of age and weight which are typically used in blood donor management. A total genetic score for Hb-deferral was estimated for each individual. The odds ratio estimate between first decile against that at ninth decile of total genetic score distribution ranged from 1.4 to 2.2.

Up to 40% of the variation in timing of birth results from genetic factors, mostly due to the maternal genome. We conducted a genome-wide meta-analysis of gestational duration and spontaneous preterm birth in 68,732 and 98,370 European mothers, respectively. The meta-analysis detected 15 loci associated with gestational duration, and four loci associated with preterm birth. Seven of the associated loci were novel. The loci mapped to several biologically plausible genes, for example HAND2 whose expression was previously shown to decrease during gestation, associated with gestational duration, and GC (Vitamin D-binding protein), associated with preterm birth. Downstream in silico-analysis suggested regulatory roles as underlying mechanisms for the associated loci. LD score regression found birth weight measures as the most strongly correlated traits, highlighting the unique nature of spontaneous preterm birth phenotype. Tissue expression and colocalization analysis revealed reproductive tissues and immune cell types as the most relevant sites of action. We report novel genetic risk loci that associate with preterm birth or gestational duration, and reproduce findings from previous genome-wide association studies. Altogether, our findings provide new insight into the genetic background of preterm birth.

FinnGen,37899293,Increased risk of dementia differs across cardiovascular diseases and types of dementia - Data from a nationwide study.,"Dementia is a major health problem. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and risk factors are associated with incident dementia. However, whether there is an association among CVD, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) at the population level remains unclear. We analysed the association between CVD (heart failure [HF], atrial fibrillation [AF], myocardial infarction [MI], peripheral arterial disease, stroke and transient ischemic attack) and the incidence of dementia using nationwide FinnGen data of 218,192 individuals. The last follow-up information on dementia was available from October 2021. The age at the end of the follow-up was 61.7 ± 17.1 years, and 53% were women. Overall, we observed 9701 (4.4%) dementia, 6323 (2.9%) AD and 1918 (0.7%) VD cases. Individuals with CVD had a higher risk of developing dementia than unexposed individuals. In the multivariable-adjusted Cox models, stroke was most strongly associated with dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-1.8). CVD was more strongly associated with VD than with AD. Individuals with HF and MI had an increased risk of AD (HF: HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.19; MI: HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18). AF was associated with VD (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.42-1.77), but not with AD (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97-1.09).

FinnGen,37741866,Mechanosensitive ion channel gene survey suggests potential roles in primary open angle glaucoma.,"Although glaucoma is a disease modulated by eye pressure, the mechanisms of pressure sensing in the eye are not well understood. Here, we investigated associations between mechanosensitive ion channel gene variants and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Common (minor allele frequency > 5%) single nucleotide polymorphisms located within the genomic regions of 20 mechanosensitive ion channel genes in the K2P, TMEM63, PIEZO and TRP channel families were assessed using genotype data from the NEIGHBORHOOD consortium of 3853 cases and 33,480 controls. Rare (minor allele frequency < 1%) coding variants were assessed using exome array genotyping data for 2606 cases and 2606 controls. Association with POAG was analyzed using logistic regression adjusting for age and sex. Two rare PIEZO1 coding variants with protective effects were identified in the NEIGHBOR dataset: R1527H, (OR 0.17, P = 0.0018) and a variant that alters a canonical splice donor site, g.16-88737727-C-G Hg38 (OR 0.38, P = 0.02). Both variants showed similar effects in the UK Biobank and the R1527H also in the FinnGen database. Several common variants also reached study-specific thresholds for association in the NEIGHBORHOOD dataset. These results identify novel variants in several mechanosensitive channel genes that show associations with POAG, suggesting that these channels may be potential therapeutic targets.",Scientific reports,2023,"Humans; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Genotype; Databases, Factual; Exome; Ion Channels",False,8

However, causality has not been established. To explore whether genetically determined circulating levels of cytokines are causally associated with female reproductive diseases and discover potential novel drug targets for these diseases. Instrumental variables (IVs) for 47 circulating cytokines were obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of 31 112 European individuals. Protein quantitative trait loci and expression quantitative trait loci close to genes served as our IVs. Summary data of 9 female reproductive diseases were mainly derived from GWAS meta-analysis of the UK biobank and FinnGen. We elevated the association using the Wald ratio or inverse variance-weighted Mendelian randomization (MR) with subsequent assessments for MR assumptions in several sensitivity and colocalization analyses. We consider a false discovery rate <0.05 as statistical significance in MR analyses. Replication studies were conducted for further validation, and phenome-wide association studies were designed to explore potential side effects. Our results indicated that high levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF), growth-regulated oncogene-alpha (GROα), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 were associated with increased risks of endometriosis, female infertility, and pre-eclampsia, respectively. High platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) levels that reduced the risk of ovarian aging were also supported. Replication analysis supported the relationship between GROα and female infertility, and between MCSF and endometriosis. We identified 4 correlated pairs that implied potential protein drug targets. Notably, we preferred highlighting the value of PDGF-BB as a drug target for ovarian aging, and MCSF as a drug target for endometriosis.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2023,"Pregnancy; Humans; Female; Cytokines; Becaplermin; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Endometriosis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Infertility, Female; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,3

FinnGen,38264647,Causal role of immune cells in generalized anxiety disorder: Mendelian randomization study.,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a prevalent emotional disorder that has received relatively little attention regarding its immunological basis. Recent years have seen the widespread use of high-density genetic markers such as SNPs or CNVs for genotyping, as well as the advancement of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) technologies, which have facilitated the understanding of immunological mechanisms underlying several major psychiatric disorders. Despite these advancements, the immunological basis of GAD remains poorly understood. In light of this, we aimed to explore the causal relationship between immune cells and the disease through a Mendelian randomization study. The summary information for GAD (Ncase=4,666, Ncontrol=337,577) was obtained from the FinnGen dataset. Summary statistics for the characterization of 731 immune cells, including morphological parameters (MP=32), median fluorescence intensity (MFI=389), absolute cells (AC=118), and relative cells (RC=192), were derived from the GWAS catalog. The study involved both forward MR analysis, with immune cell traits as the exposure and GAD as the outcome, and reverse MR analysis, with GAD as the exposure and immune cell traits as the outcome. We performed extensive sensitivity analyses to confirm the robustness, heterogeneity, and potential multi-biological effects of the study results. Also, to control for false positive results during multiple hypothesis testing, we adopted a false discovery rate (FDR) to control for statistical bias due to multiple comparisons. After FDR correction, GAD had no statistically significant effect on immunophenotypes. Several phenotypes with unadjusted low P-values are worth mentioning, including decreased PB/PC levels on B cells(β=-0.289, 95%CI=0.044~0.194,  The study has shown the close association between immune cells and GAD through genetic methods, thereby offering direction for future clinical research.",Frontiers in immunology,2023,Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Anxiety Disorders; Granulocytes; B-Lymphocytes,False,7

Using time series data from FinnGen for discovery and cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank for replication, we identified 45 viral exposures significantly associated with increased risk of neurodegenerative disease and replicated 22 of these associations. The largest effect association was between viral encephalitis exposure and Alzheimer's disease. Influenza with pneumonia was significantly associated with five of the six neurodegenerative diseases studied. We also replicated the Epstein-Barr/multiple sclerosis association. Some of these exposures were associated with an increased risk of neurodegeneration up to 15 years after infection.

However, a consensus has yet to be reached, and whether the observed association is driven by confounding factors or reverse causality remains unclear. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to determine whether genetically predicted tea intake is causally associated with the risk of common LRTI subtypes. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) from UK Biobank was used to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with an extra cup of tea intake each day. The summary statistics for acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, and influenza and pneumonia were derived from the FinnGen project. We found that genetically predicted an extra daily cup of tea intake was causally associated with the decreased risk of bronchiectasis [odds ratio (OR) = 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.47-0.78, P < 0.001], pneumonia (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.85-0.96, P = 0.002), influenza and pneumonia (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.85-0.97, P = 0.002), but not with acute bronchitis (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.82-1.01, P = 0.067) and acute bronchiolitis (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.60-1.05, P = 0.100).

FinnGen,36864135,Genome-wide analysis identifies genetic effects on reproductive success and ongoing natural selection at the FADS locus.,"Identifying genetic determinants of reproductive success may highlight mechanisms underlying fertility and identify alleles under present-day selection. Using data in 785,604 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 43 genomic loci associated with either number of children ever born (NEB) or childlessness. These loci span diverse aspects of reproductive biology, including puberty timing, age at first birth, sex hormone regulation, endometriosis and age at menopause. Missense variants in ARHGAP27 were associated with higher NEB but shorter reproductive lifespan, suggesting a trade-off at this locus between reproductive ageing and intensity. Other genes implicated by coding variants include PIK3IP1, ZFP82 and LRP4, and our results suggest a new role for the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) in reproductive biology. As NEB is one component of evolutionary fitness, our identified associations indicate loci under present-day natural selection. Integration with data from historical selection scans highlighted an allele in the FADS1/2 gene locus that has been under selection for thousands of years and remains so today.

Uncorrelated genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes (n = 231), fasting insulin (n = 38), fasting glucose (n = 71), and hemoglobin A1c (n = 75) at the genome-wide significance were selected as instrument variables. Genetic associations with 23 common GDs were obtained from the FinnGen and UK Biobank studies and other large consortia. Genetic liability to type 2 diabetes was associated with the risk of 12 GDs. Per 1-unit increase in the log-transformed odds ratio (OR) of type 2 diabetes, the OR was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03-1.09) for gastroesophageal reflux disease, 1.12 (95% CI, 1.07-1.17) for gastric ulcer, 1.11 (95% CI, 1.03-1.20) for acute gastritis, 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.13) for chronic gastritis, 1.08 (95% CI, 1.03-1.12) for irritable bowel syndrome, 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01-1.07) for diverticular disease, 1.08 (95% CI, 1.02-1.14) for acute pancreatitis, 1.09 (95% CI, 1.05-1.12) for cholelithiasis, 1.09 (95% CI, 1.05-1.13) for cholelithiasis with cholecystitis, 1.29 (95% CI, 1.17-1.43) for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 1.12 (95% CI, 1.03-1.21) for liver cirrhosis, and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89-0.97) for ulcerative colitis.

However, evidence from observational studies has been inconsistent. Mendelian randomization may be a complementary method to examine this association. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization to estimate the association between genetically determined circulating resistin concentrations and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) from the SCALLOP consortium were used as instrumental variables (IVs) for resistin. CRC genetic summary data was obtained from GECCO/CORECT/CCFR (the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium, Colorectal Cancer Transdisciplinary Study, and Colon Cancer Family Registry), and FinnGen (Finland Biobank). The inverse variance weighted method (IVW) was applied in the main analysis, and other robust methods were used as sensitivity analyses. Estimates for the association from the two data sources were then pooled using a meta-analysis approach. Thirteen pQTLs were identified as IVs explaining together 7.80% of interindividual variation in circulating resistin concentrations. Based on MR analyses, genetically determined circulating resistin concentrations were not associated with incident CRC (pooled-IVW-OR per standard deviation of resistin, 1.01; 95% CI 0.96, 1.06; p = 0.67. Restricting the analyses to using IVs within or proximal to the resistin-encoding gene (cis-IVs), or to IVs located elsewhere in the genome (trans-IVs) provided similar results.

FinnGen,36800955,The hepato-ovarian axis: genetic evidence for a causal association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Recent studies found associations between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but the causal nature of this association is still uncertain. We performed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to test for the causal association between NAFLD and PCOS using data from a large-scale biopsy-confirmed NAFLD genome-wide association study (GWAS) (1483 cases and 17,781 controls) and PCOS GWAS (10,074 cases and 103,164 controls) in European ancestries. Data from glycemic-related traits GWAS (in up to 200,622 individuals) and sex hormones GWAS (in 189,473 women) in the UK Biobank (UKB) were used in the MR mediation analysis to assess potential mediating roles of these molecules in the causal pathway between NAFLD and PCOS. Replication analysis was conducted using two independent datasets from NAFLD and PCOS GWASs in the UKB and a meta-analysis of data from FinnGen and the Estonian Biobank, respectively. A linkage disequilibrium score regression was conducted to assess genetic correlations between NAFLD, PCOS, glycemic-related traits, and sex hormones using full summary statistics. Individuals with higher genetic liability to NAFLD were more likely to develop PCOS (OR per one-unit log odds increase in NAFLD: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.18; P = 0.013). Indirect causal effects of NAFLD on PCOS via fasting insulin only (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03; P = 0.004) and further a suggestive indirect causal effect via fasting insulin in concert with androgen levels were revealed in MR mediation analyses. However, the conditional F statistics of NAFLD and fasting insulin were less than 10, suggesting likely weak instrument bias in the MVMR and MR mediation analyses. Our study suggests that genetically predicted NAFLD was associated with a higher risk of developing PCOS but less evidence for vice versa.

FinnGen,36716318,Therapeutic potential of IL6R blockade for the treatment of sepsis and sepsis-related death: A Mendelian randomisation study.,"Sepsis is characterised by dysregulated, life-threatening immune responses, which are thought to be driven by cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6). Genetic variants in IL6R known to down-regulate IL-6 signalling are associated with improved Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes, a finding later confirmed in randomised trials of IL-6 receptor antagonists (IL6RAs). We hypothesised that blockade of IL6R could also improve outcomes in sepsis. We performed a Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and near IL6R to evaluate the likely causal effects of IL6R blockade on sepsis (primary outcome), sepsis severity, other infections, and COVID-19 (secondary outcomes). We weighted SNPs by their effect on CRP and combined results across them in inverse variance weighted meta-analysis, proxying the effect of IL6RA. Our outcomes were measured in UK Biobank, FinnGen, the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI), and the GenOSept and GainS consortium. We performed several sensitivity analyses to test assumptions of our methods, including utilising variants around CRP and gp130 in a similar analysis. In the UK Biobank cohort (N = 486,484, including 11,643 with sepsis), IL6R blockade was associated with a decreased risk of our primary outcome, sepsis (odds ratio (OR) = 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.96, per unit of natural log-transformed CRP decrease). The size of this effect increased with severity, with larger effects on 28-day sepsis mortality (OR = 0.74; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.15); critical care admission with sepsis (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.78) and critical care death with sepsis (OR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.98). Similar associations were seen with severe respiratory infection: OR for pneumonia in critical care 0.69 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.97) and for sepsis survival in critical care (OR = 0.22; 95% CI 0.04 to 1.31) in the GainS and GenOSept consortium, although this result had a large degree of imprecision. We also confirm the previously reported protective effect of IL6R blockade on severe COVID-19 (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.84) in the COVID-19 HGI, which was of similar magnitude to that seen in sepsis. Sensitivity analyses did not alter our primary results. These results are subject to the limitations and assumptions of MR, which in this case reflects interpretation of these SNP effects as causally acting through blockade of IL6R, and reflect lifetime exposure to IL6R blockade, rather than the effect of therapeutic IL6R blockade. IL6R blockade is causally associated with reduced incidence of sepsis. Similar but imprecisely estimated results supported a causal effect also on sepsis related mortality and critical care admission with sepsis. These effects are comparable in size to the effect seen in severe COVID-19, where IL-6 receptor antagonists were shown to improve survival. These data suggest that a randomised trial of IL-6 receptor antagonists in sepsis should be considered.",PLoS medicine,2023,"Humans; COVID-19; Interleukin-6; Hospitalization; Receptors, Interleukin-6; Sepsis; Mendelian Randomization Analysis",False,8

FinnGen,38103512,Multi-omic insight into the molecular networks of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the genetic pathophysiology was not fully elucidated. We employed Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses to investigate the associations between mitochondrial-related genes and IBD via integrating multi-omics. Summary-level data of mitochondrial gene methylation, expression and protein abundance levels were obtained from corresponding methylation, expression and protein quantitative trait loci studies, respectively. We obtained genetic associations with IBD and its two subtypes from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (discovery), the UK Biobank (replication), and the FinnGen study (replication). We performed summary-data-based Mendelian randomization analysis to assess the associations of mitochondrial gene-related molecular features with IBD. Colocalization analysis was further conducted to assess whether the identified signal pairs shared a causal genetic variant. After integrating the multi-omics data between mQTL-eQTL and eQTL-pQTL, we identified two mitochondrial genes, i.e., PARK7 and ACADM, with tier 1 evidence for their associations with IBD and ulcerative colitis (UC). PDK1 and FISI genes were associated with UC risk with tier 2 and tier 3 evidence, respectively. The methylation of cg05467918 in ACADM was associated with lower expression of ACADM, which fits with the positive effect of cg05467918 methylation on UC risk. Consistently, the inverse associations between gene methylation and gene expression were also observed in PARK7 (cg10385390) and PDK1 (cg17679246), which were corroborated with the protective role in UC. At circulating protein level, genetically predicted higher levels of PARK7 (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25-0.52) and HINT1 (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.74) were inversely associated with IBD risk; genetically predicted higher level of HINT1 was associated with a decreased risk of Crohn's disease (CD) (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14-0.49) and a higher level of ACADM (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.55-0.83), PDK1 (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.81), FIS1 (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47-0.83) was associated with a decreased risk of UC. We found that the mitochondrial PARK7 gene was putatively associated with IBD risk, and mitochondrial FIS1, PDK1, and ACADM genes were associated with UC risk with evidence from multi-omics levels. This study identified mitochondrial genes in relation to IBD, which may enhance the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of IBD development.

Summary statistics for DKD were obtained from a large genome-wide association study (3,345 cases and 2,372 controls) and the FinnGen study (3,676 cases and 283,456 controls). Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to examine the potential targets for DKD. The colocalization analysis was used to detect whether the potential proteins exist in the shared causal variants. To enhance the credibility of the results, external validation was conducted. Additionally, enrichment analysis, assessment of protein druggability, and the protein-protein interaction networks were used to further enrich the research findings. The proteome-wide MR analyses identified 21 blood proteins that may causally be associated with DKD. Colocalization analysis further supported a causal relationship between 12 proteins and DKD, with external validation confirming 4 of these proteins, and TGFBI was affirmed through two separate group data sets.

First, the genetic instruments of 734 plasma and 151 CSF proteins were assessed for causative connections with IS from MEGASTROKE consortium by MR to identify prospective therapeutic targets. Then, for additional validation, plasma proteins from the deCODE consortium and the Fenland consortium, as well as IS GWAS data from the FinnGen cohort, the ISGC consortium and UK biobank, were employed. A thorough evaluation of the aforementioned possible pharmacological targets was carried out using meta-analysis. The robustness of MR results was then confirmed through sensitivity analysis using several techniques, such as bidirectional MR analysis, Steiger filtering, and Bayesian colocalization. Finally, methods like Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Networking were utilized to investigate the relationship between putative drug targets and therapeutic agents. The authors discovered three proteins that may function as promising therapeutic targets for IS and meet the Bonferroni correction ( P <0.05/885=5.65×10 -5 ). Prekallikrein (OR=0.41, 95% CI: 0.27-0.63, P =3.61×10 -5 ), a protein found in CSF, has a 10-fold protective impact in IS, while the plasma proteins SWAP70 (OR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.80-0.91, P =1.64×10 -6 ) and MMP-12 (OR=0.92, 95% CI: 0.89-0.95, P =4.49×10 -6 ) of each SD play a protective role in IS. Prekallikrein, MMP-12, SWAP70 was replicated in the FinnGen cohort and ISGC database. MMP-12 (OR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.91-0.94, P <0.001), SWAP70 (OR=0.92, 95% CI: 0.90-0.94, P <0.001), and prekallikrein (OR=0.53, 95% CI: 0.33-0.72, P <0.001) may all be viable targets for IS, according to the combined meta-analysis results. Additionally, no evidence of reverse causality was identified, and Bayesian colocalization revealed MMP-12 (PPH 4 =0.995), SWAP70 (PPH 4 =0.987), and prekallikrein (PPH 4 =0.894) shared the same variant with IS, supporting the robustness of the aforementioned causation. Prekallikrein and MMP-12 were associated with the target protein of the current treatment of IS. Among them, Lanadelumab, a new drug whose target protein is a prekallikrein, may be a promising new drug for the treatment of IS. The prekallikrein, MMP-12, and SWAP70 are causally associated with the risk of IS. Moreover, MMP-12 and prekallikrein may be treated as promising therapeutic targets for medical intervention of IS.","International journal of surgery (London, England)",2024,Humans; Proteome; Bayes Theorem; Ischemic Stroke; Matrix Metalloproteinase 12; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Prekallikrein; Multicenter Studies as Topic,False,8
FinnGen,38701500,Association of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists with risk of cancers-evidence from a drug target Mendelian randomization and clinical trials.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists have been approved by Food and Drug Administration for management of obesity. However, the causal relationship of GLP1R agonists (GLP1RA) with cancers still unclear. The available cis-eQTLs for drugs target genes (GLP1R) were used as proxies for exposure to GLP1RA. Mendelian randomizations (MR) were performed to reveal the association of genetically-proxied GLP1RA with 14 common types cancer from large-scale consortia. Type 2 diabetes was used as positive control, and the GWASs data including 80 154 cases and 853 816 controls. Replicating the findings in the FinnGen study and then pooled with meta-analysis. Finally, all the related randomized controlled trails (RCTs) on GLP1RA were systematically searched from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to comprehensively synthesize the evidence to validate any possible association with cancers. A total of 22 significant cis-eQTL single-nucleotide polymorphisms were included as genetic instrument. The association of genetically-proxied GLP1RA with significantly decreased type 2 diabetes risk [OR (95%)=0.82 (0.79-0.86), P <0.001], which ensuring the effectiveness of identified genetic instruments. The authors found favorable evidence to support the association of GLP1RA with reduced breast cancer and basal cell carcinoma risk [0.92 (0.88-0.96), P <0.001, 0.92 (0.85-0.99), P =0.029, respectively], and with increased colorectal cancer risk [1.12 (1.07-1.18), P <0.001]. In addition, there was no suggestive evidence to support the association of GLP1RA with ovarian cancer [0.99 (0.90-1.09), P =0.827], lung cancer [1.01 (0.93-1.10), P =0760], and thyroid cancer [0.83 (0.63-1.10), P =0.187]. Our findings were consistent with the meta-analysis. Finally, 80 RCTs were included in the systematic review, with a low incidence of different kinds of cancer. Our study suggests that GLP1RA may decrease the risk of breast cancer and basal cell carcinoma, but increase the risk of colorectal cancer. However, according to the systematic review of RCTs, the incidence of cancer in patients treated with GLP1RA is low. Larger sample sizes of RCTs with long-term follow-up are necessary to establish the incidence of cancers and evaluate the risk-benefit ratios.","International journal of surgery (London, England)",2024,"Humans; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Neoplasms; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Hypoglycemic Agents; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists",False,8
FinnGen,38382313,Phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis reveals multiple health comorbidities of coeliac disease.,"Coeliac disease (CeD) has been associated with a broad range of diseases in observational data; however, whether these associations are causal remains undetermined. We conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis (MR-PheWAS) to investigate the comorbidities of CeD. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CeD at the genome-wide significance threshold and without linkage disequilibrium (R Genetic liability to CeD was associated with 68 clinical outcomes in the UK Biobank, and 38 of the associations were replicated in the FinnGen study. Genetic liability to CeD was associated with a higher risk of several autoimmune diseases (type 1 diabetes and its complications, Graves' disease, Sjögren syndrome, chronic hepatitis, systemic and cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and sarcoidosis), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and osteoporosis and a lower risk of prostate diseases. The associations for type 1 diabetes and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma attenuated when excluding SNPs in the MHC region, indicating shared genetic aetiology. This study uncovers multiple clinical outcomes associated with genetic liability to CeD, which suggests the necessity of comorbidity monitoring among this population.

In addressing this gap, our Mendelian randomization (MR) study used data from the MiBioGen consortium encompassing 211 microbiota taxa (n = 18 340), genome-wide association study meta-analyses of 47 inflammatory cytokines, and DLBCL cases and controls from the FinnGen consortium (cases, n = 1010; controls, n = 287 137). Through bidirectional MR analyses, we examined the causal links between gut microbiota and DLBCL and used mediation analyses, including 2-step MR and multivariable MR (MVMR), to identify potential mediating inflammatory cytokines. Our findings revealed that 4 microbiota taxa were causally associated with DLBCL, and conversely, DLBCL influenced the abundance of 20 taxa. Specifically, in the 2-step MR analysis, both the genus Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 (odds ratio [OR], 1.427; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.011-2.015; P = .043) and the inflammatory cytokine monokine induced by gamma (MIG) (OR, 1.244; 95% CI, 1.034-1.487; P = .020) were found to be causally associated with an increased risk of DLBCL. Additionally, a positive association was observed between genus Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 and MIG (OR, 1.275; 95% CI, 1.069-1.520; P = .007). Furthermore, MVMR analysis indicated that the association between genus Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 and DLBCL was mediated by MIG, contributing to 14.9% of the effect (P = .005). In conclusion, our MR study provides evidence that supports the causal relationship between genus Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 and DLBCL, with a potential mediating role played by the inflammatory cytokine MIG.",Blood advances,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse; Cytokines; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Genome-Wide Association Study",False,6
FinnGen,39116870,Multisystem health comorbidity networks of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"The global burden of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is growing, but its subsequent health consequences have not been thoroughly examined. A phenome-wide association study was conducted to map the associations of MASLD with 948 unique clinical outcomes among 361,021 Europeans in the UK Biobank. Disease trajectory and comorbidity analyses were applied to visualize the sequential patterns of multiple comorbidities related to the occurrence of MASLD. The associations jointly verified by observational and polygenic phenome-wide analyses were further replicated by two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using data from the FinnGen study and international consortia. The observational and polygenic phenome-wide association study revealed the associations of MASLD with 96 intrahepatic and extrahepatic diseases, including circulatory, metabolic, genitourinary, neurological, gastrointestinal, and hematologic diseases. Sequential patterns of MASLD-related extrahepatic comorbidities were primarily found in circulatory, metabolic, and inflammatory diseases. Mendelian randomization analyses supported the causal associations between MASLD and the risk of several intrahepatic disorders, metabolic diseases, cardio-cerebrovascular disease, and ascites but found no associations with neurological diseases. This study elucidated multisystem comorbidities and health consequences of MASLD, contributing to the development of combination interventions targeting distinct pathways for health promotion among patients with MASLD.

Leveraging the UK Biobank's longitudinal health record data, MILTON predicts incident disease cases undiagnosed at time of recruitment, largely outperforming available polygenic risk scores. We further demonstrate the utility of MILTON in augmenting genetic association analyses in a phenome-wide association study of 484,230 genome-sequenced samples, along with 46,327 samples with matched plasma proteomics data.

FinnGen,38933282,Identification of drug targets for Sjögren's syndrome: multi-omics Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses.,"Targeted therapy for Sjögren's syndrome (SS) has become an important focus for clinicians. Multi-omics-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses have provided new ideas for identifying potential drug targets. We conducted summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis to evaluate therapeutic targets associated with SS by integrating DNA methylation, gene expression and protein quantitative trait loci (mQTL, eQTL, and pQTL, respectively). Genetic associations with SS were derived from the FinnGen study (discovery) and the GWAS catalog (replication). Colocalization analyses were employed to determine whether two potentially relevant phenotypes share the same genetic factors in a given region. Moreover, to delve deeper into potential regulation among DNA methylation, gene expression, and protein abundance, we conducted MR analysis to explore the causal relationship between candidate gene methylation and expression, as well as between gene expression and protein abundance. Drug prediction and molecular docking were further employed to validate the pharmacological activity of the candidate drug targets. Upon integrating the multi-omics data, we identified three genes associated with SS risk: TNFAIP3, BTN3A1, and PLAU. The methylation of cg22068371 in BTN3A1 was positively associated with protein levels, consistent with the negative effect of cg22068371 methylation on the risk of SS. Additionally, positive correlations were observed between the gene methylation of PLAU (cg04939496) and expression, as well as between expression and protein levels. This consistency elucidates the promotional effects of PLAU on SS risk at the DNA methylation, gene expression, and protein levels. At the protein level, genetically predicted TNFAIP3 (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.56-3.92) was positively associated with SS risk, while BTN3A1 (OR 2.96E-03, 95% CI 2.63E-04-3.33E-02) was negatively associated with SS risk. Molecular docking showed stable binding for candidate drugs and target proteins.

Our primary genetic instruments comprised 53 SNPs associated with IR phenotype from a GWAS of up to 188,577 participants. Genetic association estimates for hypertension and venous thromboembolism (VTE) were extracted from UK Biobank, estimates for atrial fibrillation (AF) were extracted from the hitherto largest GWAS meta-analysis on AF, estimates for heart failure were extracted from HERMES Consortium, estimates for peripheral artery disease (PAD) and aortic aneurysm were extracted from the FinnGen Study. The main analyses were performed using the random-effects inverse-variance weighted approach, and complemented by sensitivity analyses and multivariable MR analyses. Corresponding to 55% higher fasting insulin adjusted for body mass index, 0.46 mmol/L lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and 0.89 mmol/L higher triglyceride, one standard deviation change in genetically predicted IR was associated with increased risk of hypertension (odds ratio (OR) 1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.08; P = 1.91 × 10",Scientific reports,2024,"Humans; Cardiovascular Diseases; Insulin Resistance; Atrial Fibrillation; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Venous Thromboembolism; Hypertension; Heart Failure; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Hyperinsulinism; Aortic Aneurysm; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8
FinnGen,38648753,Systematic investigation of genetically determined plasma and urinary metabolites to discover potential interventional targets for colorectal cancer.,"We aimed to identify plasma and urinary metabolites related to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and elucidate their mediator role in the associations between modifiable risk factors and CRC. Metabolite quantitative trait loci were derived from 2 published metabolomics genome-wide association studies, and summary-level data were extracted for 651 plasma metabolites and 208 urinary metabolites. Genetic associations with CRC were obtained from a large-scale genome-wide association study meta-analysis (100 204 cases, 154 587 controls) and the FinnGen cohort (4957 cases, 304 197 controls). Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses were performed to evaluate the causal roles of metabolites in CRC. Druggability evaluation was employed to prioritize potential therapeutic targets. Multivariable Mendelian randomization and mediation estimation were conducted to elucidate the mediating effects of metabolites on the associations between modifiable risk factors and CRC. The study identified 30 plasma metabolites and 4 urinary metabolites for CRC. Plasma sphingomyelin and urinary lactose, which were positively associated with CRC risk, could be modulated by drug interventions (ie, olipudase alfa, tilactase). Thirteen modifiable risk factors were associated with 9 metabolites, and 8 of these modifiable risk factors were associated with CRC risk. These 9 metabolites mediated the effect of modifiable risk factors (Actinobacteria, body mass index, waist to hip ratio, fasting insulin, smoking initiation) on CRC. This study identified key metabolite biomarkers associated with CRC and elucidated their mediator roles in the associations between modifiable risk factors and CRC.

FinnGen,38263233,Causal relationship between gut microbiota and gastrointestinal diseases: a mendelian randomization study.,"Recent research increasingly highlights a strong correlation between gut microbiota and the risk of gastrointestinal diseases. However, whether this relationship is causal or merely coincidental remains uncertain. To address this, a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was undertaken to explore the connections between gut microbiota and prevalent gastrointestinal diseases. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for gut microbiota, encompassing a diverse range of 211 taxa (131 genera, 35 families, 20 orders, 16 classes, and 9 phyla), were sourced from the comprehensive MiBioGen study. Genetic associations with 22 gastrointestinal diseases were gathered from the UK Biobank, FinnGen study, and various extensive GWAS studies. MR analysis was meticulously conducted to assess the causal relationship between genetically predicted gut microbiota and these gastrointestinal diseases. To validate the reliability of our findings, sensitivity analyses and tests for heterogeneity were systematically performed. The MR analysis yielded significant evidence for 251 causal relationships between genetically predicted gut microbiota and the risk of gastrointestinal diseases. This included 98 associations with upper gastrointestinal diseases, 81 with lower gastrointestinal diseases, 54 with hepatobiliary diseases, and 18 with pancreatic diseases. Notably, these associations were particularly evident in taxa belonging to the genera Ruminococcus and Eubacterium. Further sensitivity analyses reinforced the robustness of these results. The findings of this study indicate a potential genetic predisposition linking gut microbiota to gastrointestinal diseases.

FinnGen,38477908,Cardiovascular Significance and Genetics of Epicardial and Pericardial Adiposity.,"Epicardial and pericardial adipose tissue (EPAT) has been associated with cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF) and coronary artery disease (CAD), but studies have been limited in sample size or drawn from selected populations. It has been suggested that the association between EPAT and cardiovascular disease could be mediated by local or paracrine effects. To evaluate the association of EPAT with prevalent and incident cardiovascular disease and to elucidate the genetic basis of EPAT in a large population cohort. A deep learning model was trained to quantify EPAT area from 4-chamber magnetic resonance images using semantic segmentation. Cross-sectional and prospective cardiovascular disease associations were evaluated, controlling for sex and age. Prospective associations were additionally controlled for abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volumes. A genome-wide association study was performed, and a polygenic score (PGS) for EPAT was examined in independent FinnGen cohort study participants. Data analyses were conducted from March 2022 to December 2023. The primary exposures were magnetic resonance imaging-derived continuous measurements of epicardial and pericardial adipose tissue area and visceral adipose tissue volume. Prevalent and incident CAD, AF, heart failure (HF), stroke, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). After exclusions, this study included 44 475 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.1 [7.7] years; 22 972 female [51.7%]) from the UK Biobank. Cross-sectional and prospective cardiovascular disease associations were evaluated for a mean (SD) of 3.2 (1.5) years of follow-up. Prospective associations were additionally controlled for abdominal VAT volumes for 38 527 participants. A PGS for EPAT was examined in 453 733 independent FinnGen cohort study participants. EPAT was positively associated with male sex (β = +0.78 SD in EPAT; P < 3 × 10-324), age (Pearson r = 0.15; P = 9.3 × 10-229), body mass index (Pearson r = 0.47; P < 3 × 10-324), and VAT (Pearson r = 0.72; P < 3 × 10-324). EPAT was more elevated in prevalent HF (β = +0.46 SD units) and T2D (β = +0.56) than in CAD (β = +0.23) or AF (β = +0.18). EPAT was associated with incident HF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.29 per +1 SD in EPAT; 95% CI, 1.17-1.43), T2D (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.51-1.76), and CAD (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11-1.28). However, the associations were no longer significant when controlling for VAT. Seven genetic loci were identified for EPAT, implicating transcriptional regulators of adipocyte morphology and brown adipogenesis (EBF1, EBF2, and CEBPA) and regulators of visceral adiposity (WARS2 and TRIB2). The EPAT PGS was associated with T2D (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 1.05-1.07; P =3.6 × 10-44), HF (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.06; P =4.8 × 10-15), CAD (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.05; P =1.4 × 10-17), AF (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.06; P =7.6 × 10-12), and stroke in FinnGen (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03; P =3.5 × 10-3) per 1 SD in PGS.

Previous genome-wide association studies have limitations in capturing the role of rare genetic variants in sleep-related traits. Here we conducted a large-scale exome-wide association study of eight sleep-related traits (sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, chronotype, daytime sleepiness, daytime napping, ease of getting up in the morning, snoring and sleep apnoea) among 450,000 participants from UK Biobank. We identified 22 new genes associated with chronotype (ADGRL4, COL6A3, CLK4 and KRTAP3-3), daytime sleepiness (ST3GAL1 and ANKRD12), daytime napping (PLEKHM1, ANKRD12 and ZBTB21), snoring (WDR59) and sleep apnoea (13 genes). Notably, 20 of these genes were confirmed to be significantly associated with sleep disorders in the FinnGen cohort. Enrichment analysis revealed that these discovered genes were enriched in circadian rhythm and central nervous system neurons. Phenotypic association analysis showed that ANKRD12 was associated with cognition and inflammatory traits.

This study seeks to elucidate the causal linkages between depression, specifically Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and infectious diseases. Nevertheless, the causative nature of the association between MDD and infectious diseases remains elusive. Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses was executed utilizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly connected with MDD and infectious diseases as instrumental variables (IVs). A series of sensitivity analyses were subsequently conducted. Genetic variants linked to MDD were employed as instrumental variables sourced from a genome-wide meta-analyses comprising 500,199 individuals. Summary-level data on five infectious diseases, including candidiasis, pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), and urinary tract infections (UTI), were acquired from the UK Biobank and FinnGen study. Our findings evinced that genetically predicted MDD exhibited a heightened risk of candidiasis (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.06-2.17; P = 2.38E-02), pneumonia (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.29; P = 3.16E-02), URTI (OR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.12-1.36; P = 3.71E-05), and UTI (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.12-1.42; P = 8.90E-05). Additionally, we identified bidirectional causal relationships between UTI and MDD. The associations between MDD and the risk of URTI and UTI remained consistent in multivariable MR analyses, accounting for genetically predicted smoking and body mass index.

FinnGen,37939919,Causal associations between modifiable risk factors and intervertebral disc degeneration.,"Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a common degenerative condition, which is thought to be a major cause of lower back pain (LBP). However, the etiology and pathophysiology of IVDD are not yet completely clear. To examine potential causal effects of modifiable risk factors on IVDD. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sample sizes between 54,358 and 766,345 participants. Outcomes included (1) modifiable risk factors associated with IVDD use in the forward MR; and (2) modifiable risk factors that were determined to have a causal association with IVDD in the reverse MR, including smoking, alcohol intake, standing height, education level, household income, sleeplessness, hypertension, hip osteoarthritis, HDL, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A-I, type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose, HbA1c, BMI and obesity trait. We obtained genetic variants associated with 33 exposure factors from genome-wide association studies. Summary statistics for IVDD were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. The risk factors of IVDD were analyzed by inverse variance weighting method, MR-Egger method, weighted median method, MR-PRESSO method and multivariate MR Method. Reverse Mendelian randomization analysis was performed on risk factors found to be caustically associated with IVDD in the forward Mendelian randomization analysis. The heterogeneity of instrumental variables was quantified using Cochran's Q statistic. Genetic predisposition to smoking (OR=1.221, 95% CI: 1.068-1.396), alcohol intake (OR=1.208, 95% CI: 1.056-1.328) and standing height (OR=1.149, 95% CI: 1.072-1.231) were associated with increased risk of IVDD. In addition, education level (OR=0.573, 95%CI: 0.502-0.654)and household income (OR=0.614, 95%CI: 0.445-0.847) had a protective effect on IVDD. Sleeplessness (OR=1.799, 95%CI: 1.162-2.783), hypertension (OR=2.113, 95%CI: 1.132-3.944) and type 2 diabetes (OR=1.069, 95%CI: 1.024-1.115) are three important risk factors causally associated with the IVDD. In addition, we demonstrated that increased levels of triglycerides (OR=1.080, 95%CI:1.013-1.151), fasting glucose (OR=1.189, 95%CI:1.007-1.405), and HbA1c (OR=1.308, 95%CI:1.017-1.683) could significantly increase the odds of IVDD. Hip osteoarthritis, HDL, apolipoprotein A-I, BMI and obesity trait factors showed bidirectional causal associations with IVDD, therefore we considered the causal associations between these risk factors and IVDD to be uncertain. This MR study provides evidence of complex causal associations between modifiable risk factors and IVDD. It is noteworthy that metabolic disturbances appear to have a more significant effect on IVDD than biomechanical alterations, as individuals with type 2 diabetes, elevated triglycerides, fasting glucose, and elevated HbA1c are at higher risk for IVDD, and the causal association of obesity-related characteristics with IVDD incidence is unclear.

FinnGen,38178098,Causal relationship between gut microbiota and tuberculosis: a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Growing evidence from observational studies and clinical trials suggests that the gut microbiota is associated with tuberculosis (TB). However, it is unclear whether any causal relationship exists between them and whether causality is bidirectional. A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of gut microbiota were obtained from the MiBioGen consortium, while the GWAS summary statistics of TB and its specific phenotypes [respiratory tuberculosis (RTB) and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB)] were retrieved from the UK Biobank and the FinnGen consortium. And 195 bacterial taxa from phylum to genus were analyzed. Inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, maximum likelihood (ML), weighted median, and weighted mode methods were applied to the MR analysis. The robustness of causal estimation was tested using the heterogeneity test, horizontal pleiotropy test, and leave-one-out method. In the UK Biobank database, we found that 11 bacterial taxa had potential causal effects on TB. Three bacterial taxa genus.Akkermansia, family.Verrucomicrobiacea, order.Verrucomicrobiales were validated in the FinnGen database. Based on the results in the FinnGen database, the present study found significant differences in the characteristics of gut microbial distribution between RTB and EPTB. Four bacterial taxa genus.LachnospiraceaeUCG010, genus.Parabacteroides, genus.RuminococcaceaeUCG011, and order.Bacillales were common traits in relation to both RTB and TB, among which order.Bacillales showed a protective effect. Additionally, family.Bacteroidacea and genus.Bacteroides were identified as common traits in relation to both EPTB and TB, positively associating with a higher risk of EPTB. In reverse MR analysis, no causal association was identified. No significant heterogeneity of instrumental variables (IVs) or horizontal pleiotropy was found. Our study supports a one-way causal relationship between gut microbiota and TB, with gut microbiota having a causal effect on TB.

FinnGen,38151753,Mitochondrial DNA copy number and cancer risks: A comprehensive Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Mitochondrial DNA plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of cancer. However, the associations between mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) and cancer risk are controversial. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed using three independent instrumental variables (IVs) to explore potential associations between mtDNA-CN and 20 types of cancer. The three sets of IVs were primarily obtained from participants in the UK Biobank and the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium using different methods. The outcome data of cancers were investigated using summary statistics from the FinnGen cohort. The potential causal associations were evaluated using the MR-Egger regression, weighted median, inverse-variance weighted (IVW), and weighted mode methods. The robustness of IVW estimates was validated using leave-one-out sensitivity analysis. Additionally, a meta-analysis was conducted to pool results from three sets of IVs. The results revealed that genetically predicted mtDNA-CN was not associated with cancer risk (odds ratio = 1.02; 95% confidence interval: 0.95-1.10). Subgroup analyses indicated no causal association between mtDNA-CN and breast, lung, prostate, skin, colorectal, gastric, liver, cervical uteri, esophageal, thyroid, bladder, pancreas, kidney, corpus uteri, ovary, brain, larynx, and anus cancers. It was observed that mtDNA-CN was associated with lip, oral cavity, and testis cancers. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because a small number of patients with lip and oral cavity or testis cancers were included. The comprehensive MR analysis demonstrated that mtDNA-CN is not a suitable biomarker for tumor risk assessment.",International journal of cancer,2024,"Female; Male; Humans; DNA, Mitochondrial; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; DNA Copy Number Variations; Mitochondria; Testicular Neoplasms; Genome-Wide Association Study",False,0
FinnGen,39453753,Gestational diabetes and future cardiovascular diseases: associations by sex-specific genetic data.,"Observational studies have highlighted that gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, but the causality remains unclear. Herein, the causality between genetic predisposition to gestational diabetes mellitus and the risk of cardiovascular diseases was investigated using sex-specific Mendelian randomization analysis. Linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis and two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis were applied to infer the genetic correlation and causality, respectively. Mediation analysis was conducted using a two-step Mendelian randomization approach. Sensitivity analyses were performed to differentiate causality from pleiotropy. The genome-wide association study summary statistics for gestational diabetes mellitus were obtained from FinnGen consortium, while for cardiovascular diseases were generated based on individual-level genetic data from the UK Biobank. Linkage disequilibrium score regression analyses revealed that gestational diabetes mellitus had a significant genetic correlation with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction after Benjamini-Hochberg correction in ever-pregnant women. In Mendelian randomization analyses, odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction were 1.09 (1.01-1.17) and 1.12 (.96-1.31) per unit increase in the log-odds of genetic predisposition to gestational diabetes mellitus in ever-pregnant women, respectively. Further, Type 2 diabetes and hypertension were identified as mediators for the causality of genetic predisposition to gestational diabetes mellitus on coronary artery disease. In sensitivity analyses, the direction of odds ratio for the association between instrumental variables with gestational diabetes mellitus-predominant effects and the risk of coronary artery disease was consistent with the primary results in ever-pregnant women, although not statistically significant. This study demonstrated a suggestive causal relationship between genetic predisposition to gestational diabetes mellitus and the risk of coronary artery disease, which was mainly mediated by Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. These findings highlight targeting modifiable cardiometabolic risk factors may reduce the risk of coronary artery disease in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus.",European heart journal,2024,"Humans; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Pregnancy; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Male; Cardiovascular Diseases; Sex Factors; Coronary Artery Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Adult; Linkage Disequilibrium; Myocardial Infarction; Risk Factors",False,3

This proteogenomic and functional study aimed to uncover candidate therapeutic targets for PCOS. We comprehensively investigated the causal association between circulating proteins and PCOS using two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. Cis-protein quantitative trait loci were derived from six genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on plasma proteome. Genetic associations with PCOS were obtained from a large-scale GWAS meta-analysis, FinnGen cohort, and UK Biobank. Colocalization analyses were performed to prioritize the causal role of candidate proteins. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and druggability evaluation assessed the druggability of candidate proteins. We evaluated the enrichment of tier 1 and 2 candidate proteins in individuals with PCOS and a mouse model and explored the potential application of the identified drug target. Genetically predicted levels of 65 proteins exhibited associations with PCOS risk, with 30 proteins showing elevated levels and 35 proteins showing decreased levels linked to higher susceptibility. PPI analyses revealed that FSHB, POSTN, CCN2, and CXCL11 interacted with targets of current PCOS medications. Eighty medications targeting 20 proteins showed their potential for repurposing as therapeutic targets for PCOS. EGLN1 levels were elevated in granulosa cells and the plasma of individuals with PCOS and in the plasma and ovaries of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS mouse model. As an EGLN1 inhibitor, administration of roxadustat in the PCOS mouse model elucidated the EGLN1-HIF1α-ferroptosis axis in inducing PCOS and validated its therapeutic effect in PCOS. Our study identifies candidate proteins causally associated with PCOS risk and suggests that targeting EGLN1 provides a promising treatment strategy.",American journal of human genetics,2024,"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Female; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mice; Animals; Proteome; Quantitative Trait Loci; Protein Interaction Maps; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Disease Models, Animal; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8
FinnGen,38571956,Causal relationship between inflammatory cytokines and autoimmune thyroid disease: a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) ranks among the most prevalent thyroid diseases, with inflammatory cytokines playing a decisive role in its pathophysiological process. However, the causal relationship between the inflammatory cytokines and AITD remains elusive. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to elucidate the causal connection between AITD and 41 inflammatory cytokines. Genetic variations associated with inflammatory cytokines were sourced from the FinnGen biobank, whereas a comprehensive meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) yielded data on Graves' disease (GD) and Hashimoto thyroiditis. Regarding the MR analysis, the inverse variance-weighted, MR-Egger, and weighted median methods were utilized. Additionally, sensitivity analysis was conducted using MR-Egger regression, MR-pleiotropy residual sum, and outliers. Seven causal associations were identified between inflammatory cytokines and AITD. High levels of tumor necrosis factor-β and low levels of stem cell growth factor-β were indicative of a higher risk of GD. In contrast, high levels of interleukin-12p70 (IL-12p70), IL-13, and interferon-γ and low levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and TNF-α suggested a higher risk of HD. Moreover, 14 causal associations were detected between AITD and inflammatory cytokines. GD increases the levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, MCP-1, monokine induced by interferon-γ (MIG), interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), stromal cell-derived factor-1α, platelet-derived growth factor BB, β-nerve growth factor, IL-2ra, IL-4, and IL-17 in blood, whereas HD increases the levels of MIG, IL-2ra, IP-10, and IL-16 levels.

However, comprehensive meta-analyses using Mendelian randomization (MR) to examine drinking patterns are limited. We aimed to evaluate the health risks of alcohol use by integrating findings from MR studies. A thorough search was conducted for MR studies focused on alcohol exposure. We utilized two sets of instrumental variables-alcohol consumption and problematic alcohol use-and summary statistics from the FinnGen consortium R9 release to perform de novo MR analyses. Our meta-analysis encompassed 64 published and 151 de novo MR analyses across 76 distinct primary outcomes. Results show that a genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption, independent of smoking, significantly correlates with a decreased risk of Parkinson's disease, prostate hyperplasia, and rheumatoid arthritis. It was also associated with an increased risk of chronic pancreatitis, colorectal cancer, and head and neck cancers. Additionally, a genetic predisposition to problematic alcohol use is strongly associated with increased risks of alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis, both acute and chronic pancreatitis, and pneumonia.

Fourteen known and four novel genes (SRSF6, PHPT1, CGN, and MAP3K2) were identified through protein-coding variants, with broad replication in the FinnGen cohort. Most genes we discovered exhibited the potential to predict future VTE events in longitudinal analysis. Notably, we provide evidence for the additive contribution of rare coding variants to known genome-wide polygenic risk in shaping VTE risk. The identified genes were enriched in pathways affecting coagulation and platelet activation, along with liver-specific expression. The pleiotropic effects of these genes indicated the potential involvement of coagulation factors, blood cell traits, liver function, and immunometabolic processes in VTE pathogenesis.

The summary-level datasets for inflammatory cytokines were extracted from a genome-wide association study of the Finnish Cardiovascular Risk in Young Adults Study and the FINRISK survey. The summary statistics datasets related to IA, uIA and SAH were obtained from the genome-wide association study meta-analysis of the International Stroke Genetics Consortium and FinnGen Consortium. The primary method employed for analysis was inverse variance weighting (false discovery rate), supplemented by sensitivity analyses to address pleiotropy and enhance robustness. In the International Stroke Genetics Consortium, 10, six and eight inflammatory cytokines exhibited a causal association with IA, uIA and SAH, respectively (false discovery rate, p < 0.05). In FinnGen datasets, macrophage Inflammatory Protein-1 Alpha (MIP_1A), MIP_1A and interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP_10) were verified for IA, uIA and SAH, respectively. In the reverse Mendelian randomization analysis, the common cytokines altered by uIA and SAH were vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), MIP_1A, IL_9, IL_10 and IL_17, respectively. The meta-analysis results show that MIP_1A and IP_10 could be associated with the decreased risk of IA, and MIP_1A and IP_10 were associated with the decreased risk of uIA and SAH, respectively. Notably, the levels of VEGF, MIP_1A, IL_9, IL_10 and TNF_A were increased with uIA. Comprehensive heterogeneity and pleiotropy analyses confirmed the robustness of these results.

A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted, with frailty-related data was collected from UK Biobank and TwinGen and GDM-related data was collected from the FinnGen consortium. We performed univariable and multivariable-adjusted MR with adjustments for body mass index (BMI). Several methodologies of MR were conducted to confirm the robustness of results. Frailty was significantly associated with elevated risks of GDM (OR, 3.563; 95% CI, 1.737 to 7.309; P< 0.001) and GDM was also significantly associated with elevated risks of frailty (  Our study provides evidence of the bidirectional causal association between frailty and GDM from genetic perspectives, signaling that the identification and assessment of frailty should become a standard strategy during the early stages and care of gestational diabetes.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024,"Humans; Diabetes, Gestational; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Female; Pregnancy; Frailty; Adult; Body Mass Index; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,3
FinnGen,38650934,Genetic causal relationship between immune diseases and migraine: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Migraine has an increased prevalence in several immune disorders, but genetic cause-effect relationships remain unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used in this study to explore whether immune diseases are causally associated with migraine and its subtypes. We conducted a two-sample bidirectional multivariate Mendelian randomization study. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for six immune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), allergic rhinitis (AR), asthma and psoriasis, were used as genetic instrumental variables. Summary statistics for migraine were obtained from 3 databases: the International Headache Genetics Consortium (IHGC), UK Biobank, and FinnGen study. MR analyses were performed per outcome database for each exposure and subsequently meta-analyzed. Reverse MR analysis was performed to determine whether migraine were risk factors for immune diseases. In addition, we conducted a genetic correlation to identify shared genetic variants for these two associations. No significant causal relationship was found between immune diseases and migraine and its subtypes. These results were robust with a series of sensitivity analyses. Using the linkage disequilibrium score regression method (LDSC), we detected no genetic correlation between migraine and immune diseases. The evidence from our study does not support a causal relationship between immune diseases and migraine. The mechanisms underlying the frequent comorbidity of migraine and several immune diseases need to be further elucidated.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Migraine Disorders; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Immune System Diseases; Genome-Wide Association Study; Linkage Disequilibrium; Risk Factors",False,2

We aimed to identify actionable druggable targets using Mendelian randomization (MR). Summary-level data of gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) were sourced from the eQTLGen resource. We procured genetic associations with lung cancer and its subtypes from the TRICL, ILCCO studies (discovery) and the FinnGen study (replication). We implemented Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization analysis to identify potential therapeutic targets for lung cancer. Colocalization analysis was further conducted to assess whether the identified signal pairs shared a causal genetic variant. In the main analysis dataset, we identified 55 genes that demonstrate a causal relationship with lung cancer and its subtypes. However, in the replication cohort, only three genes were found to have such a causal association with lung cancer and its subtypes, and of these, HYKK (also known as AGPHD1) was consistently present in both the primary analysis dataset and the replication cohort. Following HEIDI tests and colocalization analyses, it was revealed that HYKK (AGPHD1) is associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, with an odds ratio and confidence interval of OR = 1.28,95%CI = 1.24 to 1.33. We have found that the HYKK (AGPHD1) gene is associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, suggesting that this gene may represent a potential therapeutic target for both the prevention and treatment of lung squamous cell carcinoma.",BMC cancer,2024,"Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Quantitative Trait Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Drug Repositioning; Molecular Targeted Therapy",False,2
FinnGen,39098392,Mendelian randomization demonstrates a causal link between peripheral circulating acylcarnitines and intracranial aneurysms.,"Intracranial aneurysm (IA) is the most prevalent type of cerebral vascular disease causing life-threatening subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH). A long-term vascular structure remodeling is considered as the main pathophysiological feature of IAs. However, the causal factors triggering the pathophysiological process are not clear. Recently, the abnormalities of peripheral circulating proteins and metabolites have been found in IAs patients and associated with the ruptures. We comprehensively investigated the potential causal relationship between blood metabolites and proteins and IAs using the mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. We applied two-sample MR to explore the potential causal association between peripheral circulating metabolites (191 blood metabolites) and proteins (1398 proteins) and IAs using data from the FinnGen study and the GWAS datasets published by Bakker et al. We identified palmitoylcarnitine, stearoylcarnitine and 2-tetradecenoylcarnitine as causal contributors of IAs and ruptures. Further two-step mediation MR analysis suggested that hypertension as one of the contributors of IAs and ruptures mediated the causal relationship between palmitoylcarnitine, stearoylcarnitine and 2-tetradecenoylcarnitine and IAs. Together, our study demonstrates that blood metabolic palmitoylcarnitine, stearoylcarnitine and 2-tetradecenoylcarnitine are causally linked to the formation and rupture of IAs.

FinnGen,39567890,Sex hormones and reproductive factors with cardiac arrhythmia and ECG indices: a mendelian randomization study.,"Sex is a determinant of the incidence and etiology of arrhythmia. Observational and basic studies suggest that sex hormones are essential in this process; however, the relationship between sex hormones and arrhythmia remains unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to investigate the causal relationships between sex hormone levels, arrhythmia, and electrocardiographic (ECG) indices. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data on sex hormones, stratified by sex, from the UK biobank consortium, were used as exposure data, and data on atrial fibrillation (AF), atrioventricular block, sick sinus syndrome, paroxysmal tachycardia, and ECG indices were obtained from the FinnGen consortium and summarized large GWAS data. Inverse variance weighting or wald odds was used as the primary analytical method, and weighted medians and MR-Egger regression were used for complementary analyses. The results of the MR of sex hormones and AF from different sources were analyzed using a meta-analysis. Summary-data-based MR analysis was utilized to explore the relationship between sex-hormone related drugs and arrhythmia. In men, genetically predicted higher estradiol concentrations were associated with a lower risk of AF (odds ratio: 0.908 [0.852-0.967]; p = 0.0029], whereas genetically predicted higher concentrations of total testosterone were associated with lower heart rate variability. Sex hormones showed no association with atrioventricular block, sick sinus syndrome, paroxysmal tachycardia, resting heart rate, P wave duration, P wave terminal force in lead V1 [PTFV1], PR interval, QRS duration, QTc [QT interval corrected by heart rate], ST duration, spatial [spQRSTa] and frontal [fQRSTa] QRS-T angles in males. In females, there was no significant evidence that sex hormones are associated with arrhythmias or ECG indices. In this study, we identified a potential causal relationship between estradiol and the risk of AF in males. However, there was no significant association between sex hormones and either arrhythmias or ECG indices in females. These results suggested that sex hormones may play a limited role in cardiac arrhythmias, which requires further verification.",BMC cardiovascular disorders,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Female; Male; Electrocardiography; Genome-Wide Association Study; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Sex Factors; Heart Rate; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Action Potentials; Phenotype; Protective Factors; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Estradiol; Middle Aged",False,0
FinnGen,39136778,Exploring novel drug targets for atopic dermatitis through plasma proteome with genome.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disease with a complex and heterogeneous clinical presentation, leading to treatment limitations. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for new therapeutic drug targets. This study utilized Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) to identify potential drug targets for AD. Summary statistics for 2,940 human plasma proteins were obtained from the UK Biobank, while AD statistics came from the Early Genetics and Epidemiology of Life Processes consortium and the FinnGen consortium. Furthermore, subsequent colocalization analyses confirmed the causal roles of candidate proteins. Moreover, Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), protein-protein interaction (PPI), enrichment analysis, and single cell-type expression analysis provided additional insights. Additionally, drug prediction, druggability prediction, and molecular docking informed the discovery of novel drug targets. SMR analysis showed that eight plasma proteins were causally associated with AD: PVALB and TST were associated with a reduced risk of AD, while CA14, ECM1, IL22, IL6R, IL18R1, and MMP12 were associated with an increased risk of AD. Colocalization analysis confirmed significant associations for TST, IL22, and CA14. PheWAS further revealed that candidate drug targets were mainly linked to other allergic diseases. The corresponding protein-coding genes are predominantly expressed in melanocytes, T cells, and macrophages in skin tissue. Importantly, these proteins were identified to be involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Th17 cell differentiation, and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. All of these proteins are druggable, and six of them show great potential as drug targets.

However, the precise nature of this relationship remains uncertain. Therefore, our objective was to assess whether circulating levels of 2,923 plasma proteins are associated with the risk of PsA, utilizing the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. Two-sample MR analysis was performed to assess the causal impact of proteins on PsA risk. Exposure data for plasma proteins were sourced from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted within the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project, which encompassed 2,923 unique plasma proteins. The outcome data for PsA were sourced from the FinnGen study, a large-scale genomics initiative, comprising 3,537 cases and 262,844 controls. Additionally, colocalization analysis, Phenome-wide MR analysis, and candidate drug prediction were employed to identify potential causal circulating proteins and novel drug targets. We thoroughly assessed the association between 1,837 plasma proteins and PsA risk, identifying seven proteins associated with PsA risk. An inverse association of Interleukin-10 (IL-10) with PsA risk was observed [odds ratio (OR)=0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28 to 0.70,  This study identified 7 plasma proteins associated with PsA risk, particularly IL-10 and APOF, which offer new insights into its etiology.

The results of observational studies on the incidence of AVS in the renal dysfunction population are contradictory due to the short follow-up period and different diagnostic criteria, etc. This study aimed to explore the causal relationship between kidney function and AVS using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. We acquired summary statistics of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the CKDGen Consortium and a study on AVS from the FinnGen biobank. Univariate and multivariable MR analyses were conducted to evaluate the causal associations. The MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO Global test were applied to assess the pleiotropic effects. The heterogeneity of MR results was tested by Cochran's Q statistic. Moreover, the Bonferroni and FDR corrections were performed for multiple tests. Genetically predicted decreased eGFR may be associated with a raised risk of AVS (OR = 0.045,  Our MR study discovered that reduced eGFR may be a causative risk factor for AVS.

Current research on disc degeneration is placing a growing emphasis on the role of the immune system in this process. Nevertheless, the precise relationship between immunity and disc degeneration remains to be fully elucidated. We obtained GWAS data for immune cells from the latest summary-level GWAS, including 6,620 individuals from Sardinian and 746,667 individuals from five global populations. Summary results for IVDD were sourced from the FinnGen consortium, comprising 20,001 cases and 164,682 controls. We conducted a comprehensive univariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the potential causal relationship between immune cells and IVDD. Primary estimation was carried out using Inverse-Variance Weighting (IVW). To ensure robustness, we employed additional MR methods such as MR-Egger, Weighted Median, Weighted Mode, and Simple Mode. Various tests were employed to assess pleiotropy and heterogeneity, including the Cochran Q test, leave-one-out test, MR-Egger intercept analysis and MR-PRESSO test. To account for potential confounding factors among the immune cells, we conducted a multivariable MR analysis. Finally, we investigated the possibility of a reverse association between immune cells and IVDD through bidirectional MR. In total, our study identified 15 immune cells significantly associated with IVDD through univariable MR. Among these, 9 immune cell types were indicated as potential contributors to IVDD, while 6 were found to have protective effects. Importantly, we observed no evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy, signifying the robustness of our results. To mitigate confounding among immune cells, we utilized multivariable MR, leading to the discovery that only 9 immune cell types exerted independent effects on IVDD. These encompassed 7 as risk factors and 2 as protective factors. Additionally, our analysis revealed a bidirectional causal relationship between CD39+ CD4+ T cell %CD4+ T cell and IVDD. Our findings suggest a connection between immune cells and the risk of IVDD, shedding light on potential therapeutic avenues for modulating immune cell function in individuals with IVDD.

Despite available treatments, many severe asthma patients remain poorly managed, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. This study aims to identify potential drug targets for asthma by examining the influence of circulating plasma proteins on asthma risk. This study employs summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (MR) and two-sample MR methods to investigate the association between 2940 plasma proteins from the UK Biobank study and asthma. The analysis includes discovery (FinnGen cohort) and replication (GERA cohort) phases, with Bayesian colocalization used to validate the relationships between proteins and asthma. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction and druggability assessments were conducted on high-evidence strength protein biomarkers, and candidate drug prediction and molecular docking were performed for proteins without targeted drugs. Given the complexity of asthma pathogenesis, the study also explores the relationships between plasma proteins and asthma-related endpoints (e.g., obesity-related asthma, infection-related asthma, childhood asthma) to identify potential therapeutic targets for different subtypes. In the discovery cohort, 75 plasma proteins were associated with asthma, including IL1RAP, IL1RL1, IL6, CXCL5, and CXCL8. Additionally, 6 proteins (IL4R, LTB, CASP8, MAX, PCDH12, and SCLY) were validated through co-localization analysis and validation cohort. The assessment of drug targetability revealed potential drug targets for IL4R, CASP8, and SCLY, while candidate drugs were predicted for LTB and MAX proteins. MAX exhibited strong binding affinity with multiple small molecules indicating a highly stable interaction and significant druggability potential. Analysis of the 75 proteins with 9 asthma-related endpoints highlighted promising targets such as DOK2, ITGAM, CA1, BTN2A1, and GZMB.

Patients in the FinnGen study diagnosed between 2000 and 2014 with seropositive (n = 2368) or seronegative (n = 916) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS, n = 715), psoriatic arthritis (PsA, n = 923), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n = 190), primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS, n = 412) or gout (n = 2034) were identified from healthcare registries. Each patient was matched based on age, sex, and birth region with twenty controls without any rheumatic conditions. Overall risk ratios (RR) were calculated by comparing the prevalence of seven CV diseases between patients and controls. Logistic regression models were used for estimating odds ratios (OR) for CV comorbidities before and after the onset of rheumatic diseases. The RR for 'any CVD' varied from 1.14 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.26) in PsA to 2.05 (95 % CI 1.67-2.52) in SLE. Patients with SLE or gout demonstrated over two-fold risks for several CV comorbidities. Among CV comorbidities, venous thromboembolism (VTE) showed the highest effect sizes in several rheumatic diseases. The ORs for CV comorbidities were highest within one year before and/or after the onset of the rheumatic disease. However, in gout the excess risk of CV disease was especially high before gout diagnosis. The risk of CV comorbidities was elevated in all studied rheumatic diseases, with highest risks observed in SLE and gout. The risk for CV diseases was highest immediately before and/or after rheumatic disease diagnosis, highlighting the increased risk for CV comorbidities across all rheumatic diseases very early on the disease course.",Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,2024,"Humans; Arthritis, Psoriatic; Rheumatic Diseases; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Gout; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Cardiovascular Diseases",False,8

Instrumental variables for absolute circulating antioxidants (ascorbate, retinol, lycopene, and β-carotene) and circulating antioxidant metabolites (α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, ascorbate, and retinol) were screened from published studies. We obtained outcome data from two genome-wide association study (GWAS) databases, including the international inflammatory bowel disease genetics consortium (IIBDGC, 14,927 controls and 5,956 cases for Crohn's disease (CD), 20,464 controls and 6,968 cases for ulcerative colitis (UC), and 21,770 controls and 12,882 cases for IBD) and the FinnGen study (375,445 controls and 1,665 cases for CD, 371,530 controls and 5,034 cases for UC, and 369,652 controls and 7,625 cases for IBD). MR analysis was performed in each of the two databases and those results were pooled using meta-analysis to assess the overall effect of exposure on each phenotype. In order to confirm the strength of the findings, we additionally conducted a replication analysis using the UK Biobank. In the meta-analysis of the IIBDGC and FinnGen, we found that each unit increase in absolute circulating level of retinol was associated with a 72% reduction in the risk of UC (OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.78,  Our results provide strong evidence that the absolute circulating level of retinol is associated with a reduction in the risk of UC.

However, there is a lack of research on cathepsins and benign prostate diseases (BPDs). This study investigated the potential genetic link between cathepsins and BPDs through the utilization of Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to determine if a causal relationship exists. Publicly accessible summary statistics on BPDs were obtained from FinnGen Biobank. The data comprised 149,363 individuals, with 30,066 cases and 119,297 controls for BPH, and 123,057 individuals, with 3,760 cases and 119,297 controls for prostatitis. The IEU OpenGWAS provided the Genome-wide association data on ten cathepsins. To evaluate the causal relationship between BPDs and cathepsins, five distinct MR analyses were employed, with the primary method being the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity of the findings. The examination of IVW MR findings showed that cathepsin O had a beneficial effect on BPH (IVW OR=0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.98, P=0.0055), while cathepsin X posed a threat to prostatitis (IVW OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.00-1.16, P=0.047). Through reverse MR analysis, it was revealed that prostatitis had an adverse impact on cathepsin V (IVW OR=0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.99, P=0.035), while no favorable association was observed between BPH and cathepsins. The results obtained from MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode methods were consistent with the findings of the IVW approach. Based on sensitivity analyses, heterogeneity, and horizontal pleiotropy are unlikely to distort the results. This study offers the initial evidence of a genetic causal link between cathepsins and BPDs. Our findings revealed that cathepsin O was beneficial in preventing BPH, whereas cathepsin X posed a potential threat to prostatitis. Additionally, prostatitis negatively affected cathepsin V level.

FinnGen,38955238,No causal relationship between serum urate and neurodegenerative diseases: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies have shown that increased serum urate is associated with a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), but the causality remains unclear. We employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to assess the causal relationship between serum urate and four common subtypes of NDs, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Serum urate data came from the CKDGen Consortium. GWAS data for PD, AD, ALS, and MS were obtained from four databases in the primary analysis and then acquired statistics from the FinnGen consortium for replication and meta-analysis. Inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median (WM), and MR-Egger regression methods were applied in the MR analyses. Pleiotropic effects, heterogeneity, and leave-one-out analyses were evaluated to validate the results. There was no evidence for the effect of serum urate on PD (OR: 1.00, 95 % CI: 0.90-1.11, P = 0.97), AD (OR: 1.02, 95 % CI: 1.00-1.04, P = 0.06), ALS (OR: 1.05, 95 % CI: 0.97-1.13, P = 0.22), and MS (OR: 1.01, 95 % CI: 0.89-1.14, P = 0.90) risk when combined with the FinnGen consortium, neither was any evidence of pleiotropy detected between the instrumental variables (IVs).

However, the causal effects of gut microbiota on adrenal diseases, including Adrenocortical insufficiency, Cushing syndrome, and Hyperaldosteronism, remain unclear. This study conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using summary statistics data of gut microbiota from a large-scale genome-wide association study conducted by the MiBioGen Consortium. Summary statistics data for the three adrenal diseases were obtained from the FinnGen study. The study employed Inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO methods to assess the causal relationship between gut microbiota and these three adrenal diseases. Additionally, a reverse Mendelian randomization analysis was performed for bacteria found to have a causal relationship with these three adrenal diseases in the forward Mendelian randomization analysis. Cochran's Q statistic was used to test for heterogeneity of instrumental variables. The IVW test results demonstrate that class Deltaproteobacteria, Family Desulfovibrionaceae, and Order Desulfovibrionales exhibit protective effects against adrenocortical insufficiency. Conversely, Family Porphyromonadaceae, Genus Lachnoclostridium, and Order MollicutesRF9 are associated with an increased risk of adrenocortical insufficiency. Additionally, Family Acidaminococcaceae confers a certain level of protection against Cushing syndrome. In contrast, Class Methanobacteria, Family Lactobacillaceae, Family Methanobacteriaceae, Genus. Lactobacillus and Order Methanobacteriales are protective against Hyperaldosteronism. Conversely, Genus Parasutterella, Genus Peptococcus, and Genus Veillonella are identified as risk factors for Hyperaldosteronism. This two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis revealed a causal relationship between microbial taxa such as Deltaproteobacteria and Desulfovibrionaceae and Adrenocortical insufficiency, Cushing syndrome, and Hyperaldosteronism.

Cutaneous LP is usually transient and oral LP (OLP) is most often chronic, so we performed a large-scale genetic and epidemiological study of LP to address whether the oral and non-oral subgroups have shared or distinct underlying pathologies and their overlap with autoimmune disease. Using lifelong records covering diagnoses, procedures, and clinic identity from 473,580 individuals in the FinnGen study, genome-wide association analyses were conducted on carefully constructed subcategories of OLP (n = 3,323) and non-oral LP (n = 4,356) and on the combined group. We identified 15 genome-wide significant associations in FinnGen and an additional 12 when meta-analyzed with UKBB (27 independent associations at 25 distinct genomic locations), most of which are shared between oral and non-oral LP. Many associations coincide with known autoimmune disease loci, consistent with the epidemiologic enrichment of LP with hypothyroidism and other autoimmune diseases. Notably, a third of the FinnGen associations demonstrate significant differences between OLP and non-OLP. We also observed a 13.6-fold risk for tongue cancer and an elevated risk for other oral cancers in OLP, in agreement with earlier reports that connect LP with higher cancer incidence.

This Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted to further investigate the causal relationship between 91 inflammatory proteins and BPD. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summarized data of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis were obtained from the FinnGen Biobank. The latest study offered the GWAS data on 91 proteins related to inflammation. We performed a bidirectional MR to investigate the causal association between inflammatory proteins and BPD. The outcomes of the IVW method indicated that decreased levels of circulating interleukin-17 C (IL-17 C) (OR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.85-0.99, p-value = 0.0344) were suggestively associated with a higher risk of BPH and elevated levels of interleukin-10 receptor subunit alpha (IL-10RA) (OR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.05-1.47, p-value = 0.0132) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) (OR = 1.13, 95%CI = 1.00-1.28, p-value = 0.0421) were suggestively related to a higher risk of prostatitis. Furthermore, reverse MR revealed that BPH may promote the expression of circulating factors, including natural killer cell receptor 2B4 (CD244) (OR = 1.07, 95%CI = 1.01-1.13, p-value = 0.0192), T-cell surface glycoprotein CD6 isoform (CD6) (OR = 1.07, 95%CI = 1.01-1.13, p-value = 0.0192), and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIF-R) (OR = 1.07, 95%CI = 1.01-1.15, p-value = 0.0163).

Recent research suggests a metabolic component to the disorder. This study aims to investigate the causal relationship between blood metabolites and postpartum depression using mendelian randomization (MR). This study used a bi-directional MR framework to investigate the causal relationship between 1,400 metabolic biomarkers and postpartum depression. We used two specific genome-wide association studies datasets: one with single nucleotide polymorphisms data from mothers diagnosed with postpartum depression and another with blood metabolite data, both of which focused on people of European ancestry. Genetic variants were chosen as instrumental variables from both datasets using strict criteria to improve the robustness of the MR analysis. The combination of these datasets enabled a thorough examination of genetic influences on metabolic profiles associated with postpartum depression. Statistical analyses were conducted using techniques such as inverse variance weighting, weighted median, and model-based estimation, which enabled rigorous causal inference from the observed associations. postpartum depression was defined using endpoint definitions approved by the FinnGen study's clinical expert groups, which included leading experts in their respective medical fields. The MR analysis identified seven metabolites that could be linked to postpartum depression. Out of these, one metabolite was found to be protective, while six were associated with an increased risk of developing the condition. The results were consistent across multiple MR methods, indicating a significant correlation. This study emphasizes the potential of metabolomics for understanding postpartum depression.

However, further research is required to determine whether these associations are causal. Therefore, we evaluated the bidirectional causality between the genetic liability for OSA and nine mental disorders by using Mendelian randomization (MR). We performed two-sample bidirectional MR of genetic variants for OSA and nine mental disorders. Summary statistics on OSA and the nine mental disorders were extracted from the FinnGen study and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.

However, the causal relationship of the association remains to be investigated. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of GM was obtained from the MiBioGen consortium, and GWAS for endometriosis data was from the FinnGen consortium. Initially, a two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis was performed to identify specific bacteria associated with endometriosis. Inverse variance-weighted (IVW) was used as the main MR analysis to infer causal relationships. The other four popular MR methods including MR-Egger regression, weighted mode, weighted median, and simple mode were used for secondary confirmation. Subsequently, these selected bacteria were employed as exposure to investigate their causal effects on six sub-types of endometriosis. Furthermore, reverse MR analysis was implemented to evaluate the reverse causal effects. Cochran's Q statistics was used to test the heterogeneity of instrumental variables (IVs); MR-Egger regression was used to test horizontal pleiotropy; MR-PRESSO and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis were applied to find significant outliers. A total of 1131 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were collected as IVs for 196 GM taxa with endometriosis as the outcome. We identified 12 causal relationships between endometriosis and GM taxa including 1 phylum, 3 families, 2 orders, and 6 genera (Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Eubacterium ruminantium group, Faecalibacterium, Peptococcus, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, and Ruminococcaceae UCG005). Utilizing the Bonferroni method, we identified phylum Cyanobacteria as the strongest associated GM taxa. Subsequently, 6 significant causal effects were uncovered between the 12 selected specific GM and 6 sub-types of endometriosis. Meanwhile, no reverse causal relationship was found. Further, no horizontal pleiotropy and no significant outliers were detected in the sensitive analysis. This MR analysis revealed significant causal effects between GM and endometriosis and phylum Cyanobacteria had the strongest association. The imbalance of gut microbiota (GM) is suggested to be involved in the development of endometriosis while the causal relationship between GM and endometriosis remains undetermined. This two-sample mendelian randomisation analysis firstly demonstrated the potential association between GM and the risk of endometriosis including 6 sub-types. We revealed 12 causal relationships between endometriosis and GM taxa including 1 phylum, 3 families, 2 orders, and 6 genera while Phylum Cyanobacteria was the strongest associated GM taxa by using Bonferroni method. Meanwhile, we identified 6 significant causal effects between 12 selected specific GM and 6 sub-types of endometriosis. Meanwhile, the result from reverse MR analysis showed that there was no causal effect of endometriosis on the identified specific GM taxa.

We performed the proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) design to estimate the causal associations of protein levels with PSC risk. Therein, genetic associations with 4,907 plasma protein levels were extracted from a proteome-wide genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 35,559 individuals and those with PSC were obtained from the International PSC Study Group (2,871 cases and 12,019 controls) and the FinnGen study (1,491 cases and 301,383 controls). The colocalization analysis was performed to detect causal variants shared by proteins and PSC. The identified proteins were further enriched in pathways and diseases. A phenome-wide association screening was performed and potential drugs were assessed as well. The results indicated that genetically predicted plasma levels of 14 proteins were positively associated with an increased risk of PSC and 8 proteins were inversely associated with PSC risk in both PSC GWAS data sets, and they all survived in sensitivity analyses. The colocalization indicated that AIF1 (allograft inflammatory factor 1) and HLA-DQA2 (major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ alpha 2) were shared proteins with PSC, and they should be direct targets for PSC. The phenome-wide screening suggested that variants located at AIF1 or HLA-DQA2 region were closely associated with several autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, implicating the shared pathogenesis among them.

However, evidence regarding the causal role of IMID and periodontal disease is still lacking. Therefore, we conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to uncover the potential genetic causal effects between IMID and periodontal disease. Bidirectional two-sample MR analysis was employed. Data for ten IMIDs were sourced from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted by the FinnGen Consortium (range from 1023 to 36321 cases) and UK Biobank (UKB) (range from 150 to 17574 cases). Furthermore, GWAS data for periodontal disease were obtained from the FinnGen Consortium (87497 cases), UKB (458 cases), and Gene Lifestyle Interactions in Dental Endpoints (GLIDE) consortium (17,353 periodontitis cases). Subsequently, the causal relationships were analyzed by random effects inverse variance weighting, weighted median, and MR-Egger. Sensitivity analyses were performed using the Cochrane Q test, funnel plot, and Mr-Egger intercept test to ensure robustness. Eventually, replication analysis and meta-analysis across different databases were carried out.

This study aimed to clarify their potential causal association using mendelian randomization (MR). The summary-level statistics for gut microbiome were retrieved from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the MiBioGen consortium. As to PTSD, the Freeze 2 datasets were originated from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Working Group (PGC-PTSD), and the replicated datasets were obtained from FinnGen consortium. Single nucleotide polymorphisms meeting MR assumptions were selected as instrumental variables. The inverse variance weighting (IVW) method was employed as the main approach, supplemented by sensitivity analyses to evaluate potential pleiotropy and heterogeneity and ensure the robustness of the MR results. We also performed reverse MR analyses to explore PTSD's causal effects on the relative abundances of specific features of the gut microbiome. In Freeze 2 datasets from PGC-PTSD, eight bacterial traits revealed a potential causal association between gut microbiome and PTSD (IVW, all P < 0.05). In addition, Genus.Dorea and genus.Sellimonas were replicated in FinnGen datasets, in which eight bacterial traits revealed a potential causal association between gut microbiome and the occurrence of PTSD. The heterogeneity and pleiotropy analyses further supported the robustness of the IVW findings, providing additional evidence for their reliability. Our study provides the potential causal impact of gut microbiomes on the development of PTSD, shedding new light on the understanding of the dysfunctional gut-brain axis in this disorder.

The proteome represents a substantial source of therapeutic targets, and their coding genes may elucidate the mechanisms underlying PCOS. However, reports on the profiles of the human plasma protein-coding genes and PCOS are limited. Here, we aimed to investigate novel biomarkers or drug targets for PCOS by integrating genetics and the human plasma proteome. Our study acquired the protein quantitative trait loci from DECODE Genetics, offering 4,907 proteins in 35,559 individuals while obtaining PCOS summary statistics by accessing the FinnGen biobank (1,639 cases and 218,970 controls) and the genome-wide association study catalog (797 cases and 140,558 controls). Herein, we sequentially used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses and colocalization to verify the causal link between candidate proteins, their coding genes, and PCOS. Further PCOS data download was conducted by accessing the Gene Expression Omnibus and Zenodo platforms. Gene expression level analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, immune cell infiltration, and transcription factor prediction were performed, aiming at detecting specific cell types with enriched expression and exploring potential optimized treatments for PCOS. MR analysis revealed 243 protein-coding genes with a causal relationship to PCOS risk, of which 12 were prioritized with the most significant evidence.

FinnGen,39327062,Investigating the uncertain causal link between gut microbiota and glaucoma: A genetic correlation and Mendelian randomisation study.,"Glaucoma is the most common cause of irreversible blindness, and gut microbiota (GM) is associated with glaucoma. Whether this association represents a causal role remains unknown. This study aims to assess the potential association and causal link between GM and various forms of glaucoma, emphasising the need for cautious interpretation of the strength of these associations. Employing a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomisation (MR) framework with false discovery rate correction and various sensitivity analyses, supplemented by genetic correlation analysis via linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and colocalisation for European summary-level data between MiBioGen consortium and FinnGen Study, we sought to explore the relationship between GM and glaucoma. While certain microbial taxa showed potential associations with glaucoma subtypes (e.g., Erysipelotrichaceae with primary angle closure glaucoma, Senegalimassilia with exfoliation glaucoma), the overall findings suggest a complex and not definitively causal relationship between GM and glaucoma. Notably, reverse MR analysis did not establish a significant causal effect of glaucoma on GM composition, and no consistent genetic correlations were observed between GM and glaucoma. While our study provides some evidence of associations between specific GM taxa and glaucoma, the results underscore the complexity of these relationships and the need for further research to clarify the potential causal links. The findings highlight the importance of interpreting the gut-eye axis with caution and suggest that while GM may play a role in glaucoma, it is unlikely to be a predominant causal factor.",Clinical & experimental ophthalmology,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Glaucoma; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Linkage Disequilibrium; Genome-Wide Association Study",False,6
FinnGen,38776057,Inflammatory cytokines and their potential role in kidney stone disease: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Previous studies have reported a complex relationship between inflammatory cytokines and kidney stone disease (KSD). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential causal impact of inflammatory cytokines on KSD by Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. In our study, a thorough two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed by us to determine the potential causal relationship between inflammatory cytokines and kidney stone disease. Utilizing GWAS summary data of inflammatory cytokines and KSD, we performed the first two-sample MR analysis. Genetic variants in GWASs related to inflammatory cytokines were employed as instrumental variables (IVs). The data on cytokines were derived from 14,824 participants and analyzed by utilizing the Olink Target-96 Inflammation Panel. GWAS summary data related to KSD (9713 cases and 366,693 controls) were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. The primary MR analysis method was Inverse variance weighted. Reverse MR analysis, Cochran's Q test, MR Egger, and MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) were used to assess the stability of the results. 91 cytokines were enrolled in the MR analysis after strict quality control of IV. The IVW analysis revealed 2 cytokines as risk factors for KSD: Cystatin D (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11), Fibroblast growth factor 5 (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00-1.12), suggesting they are positively associated with the occurrence of kidney stones. We also found 3 protective associations between cytokines and KSD: Artemin (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.96), T-cell surface glycoprotein CD6 isoform (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.98), STAM-binding protein (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-0.99). There was no horizontal pleiotropy or significant heterogeneity in our MR analysis, as determined by the p-value results of our MR Egger's intercept test, Cochrane Q-test, and MR-PRESSO, which were all > 0.05.

FinnGen,38932472,An Inherited Allele Confers Prostate Cancer Progression and Drug Resistance via RFX6/HOXA10-Orchestrated TGFβ Signaling.,"Genetic and epigenetic alterations are cancer hallmark characteristics. However, the role of inherited cancer predisposition alleles in co-opting lineage factor epigenetic reprogramming and tumor progression remains elusive. Here the FinnGen cohort phenome-wide analysis, along with multiple genome-wide association studies, has consistently identified the rs339331-RFX6/6q22 locus associated with prostate cancer (PCa) risk across diverse populations. It is uncovered that rs339331 resides in a reprogrammed androgen receptor (AR) binding site in PCa tumors, with the T risk allele enhancing AR chromatin occupancy. RFX6, an AR-regulated gene linked to rs339331, exhibits synergistic prognostic value for PCa recurrence and metastasis. This comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate the oncogenic functions of RFX6 in promoting PCa cell proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistically, RFX6 upregulates HOXA10 that profoundly correlates with adverse PCa outcomes and is pivotal in RFX6-mediated PCa progression, facilitating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and modulating the TGFβ/SMAD signaling axis. Clinically, HOXA10 elevation is associated with increased EMT scores, tumor advancement and PCa recurrence. Remarkably, reducing RFX6 expression restores enzalutamide sensitivity in resistant PCa cells and tumors. This findings reveal a complex interplay of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in PCa pathogenesis and drug resistance, centered around disrupted prostate lineage AR signaling and abnormal RFX6 expression.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2024,"Animals; Humans; Male; Mice; Alleles; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Progression; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Genome-Wide Association Study; Homeodomain Proteins; Prostatic Neoplasms; Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors; Signal Transduction; Transforming Growth Factor beta",False,0

Publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were used for Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. GWASs of NAFLD and fractures were obtained from the FinnGen Consortium. GWASs of bone mineral density (BMD) were derived from a meta-analysis. GWASs of obesity, diabetes, liver function, and serum lipid-related metrics were used to clarify whether the accompanying NAFLD symptoms contributed to fractures. Moreover, two additional GWASs of NAFLD were applied. A causal association was not observed between NAFLD and BMD using GWASs from the FinnGen Consortium. However, a causal relationship between NAFLD and femoral neck-BMD (FN-BMD), a suggestive relationship between fibrosis and FN-BMD, and between NAFLD and osteoporosis were identified in replication GWASs. Genetically proxied body mass index (BMI), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and hip circumference increased the likelihood of lower limb fractures. The waist-to-hip ratio decreased, whereas glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-B) increased the risk of forearm fractures. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) reduced, whereas HbA1C increased the incidence of femoral fractures. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) raised the risk of foot fractures. However, after a multivariate MR analysis (adjusted for BMI), all the relationships became insignificant. NAFLD caused reduced BMD, and genetically predicted HDL, LDL, HbA1C, HOMA-B, ALP, hip circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio causally increased the risk of fractures.

Data for plasma proteins were selected from the deCODE Health study and the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project. Data for hypertension were extracted from the FinnGen Study. Moreover, proteome-wide Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses, 2-step Mendelian randomization, and gene function and network prediction, as well as druggability assessment were performed. We finally identified 8 proteins (ANXA4 [annexin A4], DLK1 [protein delta homolog 1], KLB [β-klotho], MMP8 [matrix metallopeptidase 8], PLAT [tissue-type plasminogen activator], POSTN [periostin], SAT2 [thialysine N-ε-acetyltransferase], and IFNLR1 [interferon λ receptor 1]) mediating association of smoking with hypertension. PLAT and IFNLR1 were identified to be involved in the complement and coagulation cascades and the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway. ANXA4, KLB, MMP8, PLAT, and IFNLR1 had druggability. Moreover, IFNLR1 had strong evidence of genetic colocalization, because the posterior probability for H4 of IFNLR1 was 91.3%.

We performed a comprehensive Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relevance of T2DM to CVD outcomes and cardiac structure/function. Bidirectional two-sample MR was conducted using summary-level data from European-ancestry genome-wide association studies. The T2DM GWAS data included 80 154 cases and 853 816 controls from the DIAGRAM consortium. Outcomes included coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and various quantitative cardiac imaging traits assessed by magnetic resonance imaging.

This investigation harnessed the unparalleled breadth of plasma protein and KSD pooled genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, sourced from the United Kingdom Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKBPPP) and the FinnGen database version R10. Through Mendelian randomization analysis, proteins exhibiting a causal influence on KSD were pinpointed. Subsequent co-localization analyses affirmed the stability of these findings, while enrichment analyses evaluated their potential for pharmacological intervention. Culminating the study, a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) was executed, encompassing all phenotypes (2408 phenotypes) catalogued in the FinnGen database version R10. Our MR analysis identified a significant association between elevated plasma levels of proteins FKBPL, ITIH3, and SERPINC1 and increased risk of KSD based on genetic predictors. Conversely, proteins CACYBP, DAG1, ITIH1, and SEMA6C showed a protective effect against KSD, documented with statistical significance (P",Urolithiasis,2024,Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Proteome; Nephrolithiasis; Phenotype; Proteomics,False,8
FinnGen,38420789,Causal Relationship Between Branched-Chain Amino Acids and Hypertension: A Mendelian Randomization Study.,"This study aimed to investigate the causal relationships between branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and the risks of hypertension via meta-analysis and Mendelian randomization analysis. A meta-analysis of 32 845 subjects was conducted to evaluate the relationships between BCAAs and hypertension. In Mendelian randomization analysis, independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BCAAs at the genome-wide significance level were selected as the instrumental variables. Meanwhile, the summary-level data for essential hypertension and secondary hypertension end points were obtained from the FinnGen study. As suggested by the meta-analysis results, elevated BCAA levels were associated with a higher risk of hypertension (isoleucine: summary odds ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.08-1.47]; leucine: summary odds ratio, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.07-1.52]; valine: summary odds ratio, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.12-1.57]). Moreover, the inverse variance-weighted method demonstrated that an elevated circulating isoleucine level might be the causal risk factor for essential hypertension but not secondary hypertension (essential hypertension: odds ratio, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.12-1.34]; secondary hypertension: odds ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.54-1.68]). The increased levels of 3 BCAAs positively correlated with an increased risk of hypertension. Particularly, elevated isoleucine level is a causal risk factor for essential hypertension. Increased levels of leucine and valine also tend to increase the risk of essential hypertension, but further verification is still warranted.",Journal of the American Heart Association,2024,"Humans; Amino Acids, Branched-Chain; Isoleucine; Leucine; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Valine; Hypertension; Essential Hypertension; Genome-Wide Association Study",False,8
FinnGen,39075078,Association between periodontal disease and schizophrenia: a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"The connection between periodontal disease (PD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) has been reported in observational studies, but it remains unclear. This research aims to examine the bidirectional causal impacts between PD and SCZ. The FinnGen consortium supplied summarized data on PD for 346,731 individuals (87,497 cases and 259,234 controls) of Finnish ancestry, and information on SCZ was acquired from the OpenGWAS repository, encompassing 127,906 individuals (52,017 cases and 75,889 controls) of European ancestry. Next, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to establish a causal inference relationship between PD and SCZ. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was utilized as the primary analysis. Additionally, some sensitivity analyses were utilized to verify the stability of the results. The analysis of IVW results indicated no impact of PD on SCZ (IVW OR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.97-1.24, P = 0.14). Nevertheless, the inverse relationship between PD and SCZ was identified through reverse MR analysis (IVW OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, P = 0.002). The findings from MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode approaches aligned with the outcomes of the IVW method. Based on sensitivity analyses, horizontal pleiotropy is unlikely to distort causal estimates. This study presented the initial proof of a genetic causal relationship between SCZ and PD, albeit with a minimal impact. Further exploration is needed to gain a deeper understanding of this relationship. Furthermore, no genetic causal relationship between PD and SCZ was identified.",Scientific reports,2024,"Schizophrenia; Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Periodontal Diseases; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genome-Wide Association Study; Case-Control Studies; Finland",False,4

FinnGen,39254198,Causal relationships between gut microbiota and polycystic ovarian syndrome: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"Previous studies have established a link between gut microbiota and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but little is known about their precise causal relationship. Therefore, this study aims to explore whether there are precise causal relationships between gut microbiota and PCOS. We performed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Datasets were from the largest published meta-analysis on gut microbiota composition and the FinnGen cohort of the IEU Open Genome-Wide Association Study Project database. Inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, constrained maximum likelihood-based Mendelian randomization, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode were used. Cochran's Q and MR-Egger intercept tests were employed to measure the heterogeneity. A total of 211 gut microbiota taxa were identified in MR analysis. Nine taxa of bacteria, including Alphaproteobacteria (0.55, 0.30-0.99, p = 0.04), Bacilli (1.76, 1.07-2.91, p = 0.03), Bilophila (0.42, 0.23-0.77, p < 0.01), Blautia (0.16, 0.03-0.79, p = 0.02), Burkholderiales (2.37, 1.22-4.62, p = 0.01), Candidatus Soleaferrea (0.65, 0.43-0.98, p = 0.04), Cyanobacteria (0.51, 0.31-0.83, p = 0.01), Holdemania (0.53, 0.35-0.81, p < 0.01), and Lachnospiraceae (1.86, 1.04-3.35, p = 0.03), were found to be associated with PCOS in the above MR methods included at least IVW method. Cochran's Q statistics and MR-Egger intercept test suggested no significant heterogeneity. In addition, 69 taxa were shown significant for at least the IVW method in reverse MR analysis, of these, 25 had a positive correlation, and 37 had a negative correlation. Additionally, Alphaproteobacteria and Lachnospiraceae (0.95, 0.91-0.98, p < 0.01; 0.97, 0.94-0.99, p = 0.02, respectively) were shown a bidirected causally association with PCOS.

FinnGen,38554235,Osteoporosis and Primary Biliary Cholangitis: A Trans-ethnic Mendelian Randomization Analysis.,"Osteoporosis is a major clinical problem in many autoimmune diseases, including primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), the most common autoimmune liver disease. Osteoporosis is a major cause of fracture and related mortality. However, it remains unclear whether PBC confers a causally risk-increasing effect on osteoporosis. Herein, we aimed to investigate the causal relationship between PBC and osteoporosis and whether the relationship is independent of potential confounders. We performed bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to investigate the association between PBC (8021 cases and 16,489 controls) and osteoporosis in Europeans (the UK Biobank and FinnGen Consortium: 12,787 cases and 726,996 controls). The direct effect of PBC on osteoporosis was estimated using multivariable MR analyses. An independent replication was conducted in East Asians (PBC: 2495 cases and 4283 controls; osteoporosis: 9794 cases and 168,932 controls). Trans-ethnic meta-analysis was performed by pooling the MR estimates of Europeans and East Asians. Inverse-variance weighted analyses revealed that genetic liability to PBC was associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis in Europeans (OR, 1.040; 95% CI, 1.016-1.064; P = 0.001). Furthermore, the causal effect of PBC on osteoporosis persisted after adjusting for BMI, calcium, lipidemic traits, and sex hormones. The causal relationship was further validated in the East Asians (OR, 1.059; 95% CI, 1.023-1.096; P = 0.001). Trans-ethnic meta-analysis confirmed that PBC conferred increased risk on osteoporosis (OR, 1.045; 95% CI, 1.025-1.067; P = 8.17 × 10",Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology,2024,"Female; Humans; Male; Asian People; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Osteoporosis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; White People; European People; East Asian People",False,2
FinnGen,39043809,Effects of genetically proxied statins on diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy: a Mendelian randomization study.,"There is no reliable causal evidence for the effect of statins on diabetic nephropathy (DN) and diabetic retinopathy (DR), and the results of previous observational studies are contradictory. Genetic variants linked to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from a UK biobank genome-wide association study and located within a 100kb window around HMGCR were used to proxy statins, comparing with PCSK9 inhibitors (control). DN and DR genome-wide association study summary statistics were obtained from the FinnGen study. Secondary MR analyses and NHANES cross-sectional data were used for validation. Drug-target Mendelian randomization (MR) was applied to investigate the association between the genetically proxied inhibition of HMGCR and PCSK9 with DN and DR, p < 0.0125 was considered significant after Bonferroni Correction. To triangulate the findings, genetic variants of whole blood-derived targets gene expression (cis-eQTL) and plasma-derived protein (cis-pQTL) levels were used to perform secondary MR analyses and data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used for cross-sectional analysis. Genetically proxied inhibition of HMGCR was associated with higher risks of DN and DR (DN: OR = 1.79, p = 0.01; DR: OR = 1.41, p = 0.004), while no such association was found for PCSK9. Secondary MR analyses confirmed these associations. Cross-sectional analysis revealed a positive link between statin use and DR incidence (OR = 1.26, p = 0.03) and a significant negative association with glomerular filtration rate (Beta = - 1.9, p = 0.03). This study provides genetic evidence that genetically proxied inhibition of HMGCR is associated with increased risks of DN/DR, and this effect may not be attributed to their LDL-C-lowering properties.

FinnGen,38811927,Causal relationship between resting-state networks and depression: a bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomization study.,"Cerebral resting-state networks were suggested to be strongly associated with depressive disorders. However, the causal relationship between cerebral networks and depressive disorders remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of resting-state networks on depressive disorders using a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) design. Updated summary-level genome-wide association study (GWAS) data correlated with resting-state networks were obtained from a meta-analysis of European-descent GWAS from the Complex Trait Genetics Lab. Depression-related GWAS data were obtained from the FinnGen study involving participants with European ancestry. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and multiband diffusion imaging of the brain were performed to measure functional and structural connectivity in seven well-known networks. Inverse-variance weighting was used as the primary estimate, whereas the MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outliers (PRESSO), MR-Egger, and weighted median were used to detect heterogeneity, sensitivity, and pleiotropy. In total, 20,928 functional and 20,573 structural connectivity data as well as depression-related GWAS data from 48,847 patients and 225,483 controls were analyzed. Evidence for a causal effect of the structural limbic network on depressive disorders was found in the inverse variance-weighted limbic network (odds ratio, [Formula: see text]; 95% confidence interval, [Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text]), whereas the causal effect of depressive disorders on SC LN was not found(OR=1.0025; CI,1.0005-1.0046; P=0.012). No significant associations between functional connectivity of the resting-state networks and depressive disorders were found in this MR study. These results suggest that genetically determined structural connectivity of the limbic network has a causal effect on depressive disorders and may play a critical role in its neuropathology.",BMC psychiatry,2024,Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Nerve Net; Depressive Disorder; Brain; Female; Connectome; Male,False,9
FinnGen,39257908,Inflammatory factors and risk of lung adenocarcinoma: a Mendelian randomization study mediated by blood metabolites.,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common type of lung cancer, and its pathogenesis remains not fully elucidated. Inflammation and metabolic dysregulation are considered to play crucial roles in LUAD development, but their causal relationships and specific mechanisms remain unclear. This study employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to systematically evaluate the causal associations between 91 circulating inflammatory factors, 1,400 serum metabolites, and LUAD. We utilized LUAD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from the FinnGen biobank and GWAS data of metabolites and inflammatory factors from the GWAS catalog to conduct two-sample MR analyses. For the identified key metabolites, we further used mediator MR to investigate their mediating effects in the influence of IL-17A on LUAD and explored potential mechanisms through protein-protein interaction and functional enrichment analyses. The MR analyses revealed that IL-17A (OR 0.78, 95%CI 0.62-0.99) was negatively associated with LUAD, while 71 metabolites were significantly associated with LUAD. Among them, ferulic acid 4-sulfate may play a crucial mediating role in the suppression of LUAD by IL-17A (OR 0.87, 95%CI 0.78-0.97). IL-17A may exert its anti-LUAD effects through extensive interactions with genes related to ferulic acid 4-sulfate metabolism (such as SULT1A1, CYP1A1, etc.), inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, as well as downstream tumor-related pathways of ferulic acid 4-sulfate (such as MAPK, NF-κB, etc.). This study discovered causal associations between IL-17A, multiple serum metabolites, and LUAD occurrence, revealing the key role of inflammatory and metabolic dysregulation in LUAD pathogenesis. Our findings provide new evidence-based medical support for specific inflammatory factors and metabolites as early predictive and risk assessment biomarkers for LUAD, offering important clues for subsequent mechanistic studies and precision medicine applications.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Genome-Wide Association Study; Inflammation; Interleukin-17; Risk Factors; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,2
FinnGen,38051322,The Association Between SHBG and Osteoporosis: A NHANES Cross-Sectional Study and A Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization.,"This study aimed to examine the association between sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and osteoporosis through a cross-sectional study and a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR). We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 data, with exposure as serum SHBG and outcome as osteoporosis and performed multivariate logistic regression to test the correlation between SHBG and osteoporosis. To determine the causal relationship between SHBG and osteoporosis, a two-sample bidirectional MR was employed. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset for SHBG (n = 189,473) was obtained from the IEU database, and the GWAS dataset for osteoporosis (n = 212,778) was obtained from the FinnGen bioBank. The principal MR technique was inverse-variance weighting (IVW). In MR analyses, the MR-Egger intercept and Cochran Q test were used to detect multiple validity and horizontal heterogeneity. 1249 older adult participants (age ≥ 60) were involved in the cross-sectional study, including 113 osteoporosis cases. We identified a significant relationship between circulating SHBG concentration and osteoporosis risk [OR 3.963, 95% CI (2.095-7.495), P < 0.05]. Subgroup analysis indicated that SHBG was closely linked to the risk of osteoporosis in the female population [OR 1.008, 95% CI (1.002-1.013), P = 0.005] but not in males (P = 0.065). In addition, The IVW approach suggested a causal connection between SHBG and increased osteoporosis risk [OR 1.479, 95% CI (1.144-1.912), P = 0.003], and the MR-Egger intercept and the Cochran Q test validated the consistency of the MR results. Finally, the reverse MR analysis declined to identify a causal relation between SHBG and osteoporosis. Our research demonstrates a significant causal connection between circulating SHBG levels and increased osteoporosis risk. These results indicate that high SHBG may be associated with the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, but more research is needed.",Calcified tissue international,2024,Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Nonoxynol; Nutrition Surveys; Osteoporosis; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin,False,0

Comprehensive data from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) were analyzed, specifically AD data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (71,880 cases/383,378 controls), and DR, PDR, and NPDR data from both the FinnGen consortium (FinnGen release R8, DR: 5,988 cases/314,042 controls; PDR: 8,383 cases/329,756 controls; NPDR: 3,446 cases/314,042 controls) and the IEU OpenGWAS (DR: 14,584 cases/176,010 controls; PDR: 8,681 cases/204,208 controls; NPDR: 2,026 cases/204,208 controls). The study also incorporated Functional Mapping and Annotation (FUMA) for an in-depth analysis of the GWAS results. The MR analyses revealed that genetic susceptibility to AD significantly increases the risk of DR, as evidenced by GWAS data from the FinnGen consortium (OR: 2.5090; 95% confidence interval (CI):1.2102-5.2018, false discovery rate P-value ( This study underscores the contribution of AD to an increased risk of DR, as well as NPDR and PDR subtypes, underscoring the necessity of a holistic approach in the management of patients affected by these conditions.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Alzheimer Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Risk Factors; Diabetic Retinopathy; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,4
FinnGen,38952391,Assessing causal associations of blood counts and biochemical indicators with pulmonary arterial hypertension: a Mendelian randomization study and results from national health and nutrition examination survey 2003-2018.,"Blood counts and biochemical markers are among the most common tests performed in hospitals and most readily accepted by patients, and are widely regarded as reliable biomarkers in the literature. The aim of this study was to assess the causal relationship between blood counts, biochemical indicators and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to assess the causal relationship between blood counts and biochemical indicators with PAH. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) for blood counts and biochemical indicators were obtained from the UK Biobank (UKBB), while the GWAS for PAH were sourced from the FinnGen Biobank. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the primary analysis method, supplemented by three sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results. And we conducted an observational study using data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2018 to verify the relationship.

We aimed to identify it using a national cohort and Mendelian randomization (MR). We enrolled 30,442 participants from the 2007 to 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Demographics, pulmonary function indices (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1], forced vital capacity [FVC]), and variables used to calculate the liver fat score (LFS) were collected. A two-sample MR analysis employing the summary data of genome-wide association studies on MASLD and FEV1/FVC, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma from the Finngen Biobank and Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit was performed. A total of 3,462 participants, 1,335 of whom had MASLD (LFS > -0.640), were finally included in the study.

FinnGen,38479924,Red and processed meat intake and risk of cardiovascular disease: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Previous observational studies have yielded inconsistent findings regarding associations between red/processed meat intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Some studies have suggested positive relationships, while others have demonstrated no significant associations. However, causal effects remain uncertain. This 2023 Mendelianrandomization (MR) study investigated the causal relationship between red and processed meat (porkmeat, mutton meat, beef meat)intake and CVD risk by analyzing summary data from the UK Biobank (exposure), CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (coronary artery disease [CAD]), MEGASTROKE (stroke), Nielsen et al. (atrial fibrillation [AF]), HERMES (heart failure [HF]), and FinnGen (cardiovascular outcomes) public databases. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of red meat (pork, beef, and mutton) and processed meat were sourced from the United Kingdom (UK) Biobank. GWAS data on CVD for this study were obtained from the Gene and FinnGen consortia. The primary method employed for the two-sample MR analysis was inverse variance weighting (IVW). Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the reliability and consistency of the results. Genetically predicted red and processed meat consumption did not demonstrate a causal association with any CVD outcomes when employing the IVW method. For processed meat intake, the odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence intervals CIs) in large consortia were as follows: 0.88 (0.56-1.39) for CAD, 0.91 (0.65-1.27) for AF, 0.84 (0.58-1.21) for HF, and 1.00 (0.75-1.05) for stroke. In FinnGen, the ORs were as follows: 1.15 (0.83-1.59) for CAD, 1.25 (0.75-2.07) for AF, 1.09 (0.73-1.64) for HF, and 1.27 (0.85-1.91) for stroke. For beef intake, the ORs (95% CIs) in large consortia were as follows: 0.70 (0.28-1.73) for CAD, 0.85 (0.49-1.49) for AF, 0.80 (0.35-1.83) for HF, and 1.29 (0.85-1.95) for stroke. In FinnGen, the ORs were as follows: 2.01 (0.75-5.39) for CAD, 1.83 (0.60-5.56) for AF, 0.80 (0.30-2.13) for HF, and 1.30 (0.62-2.73) for stroke. For pork intake, the ORs (95% CIs) in large consortia were as follows: 1.25 (0.37-4.22) for CAD, 1.26 (0.73-2.15) for AF, 1.71 (0.86-3.39) for HF, and 1.15 (0.63-2.11) for stroke. In FinnGen, the ORs were as follows: 1.12 (0.43-2.88) for CAD, 0.39 (0.08-1.83) for AF, 0.62 (0.20-1.88) for HF, and 0.60 (0.21-1.65) for stroke. For mutton intake, the ORs (95% CIs) in large consortia were as follows: 0.84 (0.48-1.44) for CAD, 0.84 (0.56-1.26) for AF, 1.04 (0.65-1.67) for HF, and 1.06 (0.77-1.45) for stroke. In FinnGen, the ORs were as follows: 1.20 (0.65-2.21) for CAD, 0.92 (0.44-1.92) for AF, 0.74 (0.34-1.58) for HF, and 0.75 (0.45-1.24) for stroke. The results remained robust and consistent in both the meta-analysis and supplementary MR analysis.

FinnGen,38800490,A causal examination of the correlation between hormonal and reproductive factors and low back pain.,"The relationship between hormonal fluctuations in the reproductive system and the occurrence of low back pain (LBP) has been widely observed. However, the causal impact of specific variables that may be indicative of hormonal and reproductive factors, such as age at menopause (ANM), age at menarche (AAM), length of menstrual cycle (LMC), age at first birth (AFB), age at last live birth (ALB) and age first had sexual intercourse (AFS) on low back pain remains unclear. This study employed Bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) using publicly available summary statistics from Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and FinnGen Consortium to investigate the causal links between hormonal and reproductive factors on LBP. Various MR methodologies, including inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, and weighted median, were utilized. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure the robustness and validity of the findings. Subsequently, Multivariate Mendelian randomization (MVMR) was employed to assess the direct causal impact of reproductive and hormone factors on the risk of LBP. After implementing the Bonferroni correction and conducting rigorous quality control, the results from MR indicated a noteworthy association between a decreased risk of LBP and AAM (OR=0.784, 95% CI: 0.689-0.891; p=3.53E-04), AFB (OR=0.558, 95% CI: 0.436-0.715; p=8.97E-06), ALB (OR=0.396, 95% CI: 0.226-0.692; p=0.002), and AFS (OR=0.602, 95% CI: 0.518-0.700; p=3.47E-10). Moreover, in the reverse MR analysis, we observed no significant causal effects of LBP on ANM, AAM, LMC and AFS. MVMR analysis demonstrated the continued significance of the causal effect of AFB on LBP after adjusting for BMI. Our study explored the causal relationship between ANM, AAM, LMC, AFB, AFS, ALB and the prevalence of LBP. We found that early menarche, early age at first birth, early age at last live birth and early age first had sexual intercourse may decrease the risk of LBP. These insights enhance our understanding of LBP risk factors, offering valuable guidance for screening, prevention, and treatment strategies for at-risk women.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024,Humans; Low Back Pain; Female; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Menarche; Menopause; Risk Factors; Adult; Menstrual Cycle; Age Factors; Middle Aged,False,9
FinnGen,39098611,Immune thrombocytopenia increases the risk of thrombosis: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a prevalent autoimmune bleeding disorder, with the primary objective of treatment being the prevention of bleeding. Clinical investigations have indicated that individuals with ITP face an elevated risk of thrombosis, and the occurrence of thromboembolic events in ITP patients can be attributed to a multitude of factors. However, establishing a definitive causal relationship between ITP and thrombosis remains challenging. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study utilizing summary data from FinnGen consortium and UK Biobank was undertaken to investigate the causal association between ITP and thrombosis. The primary analysis employed the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, while supplementary analyses were conducted using the MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO approaches. Based on IVW method, there was a statistically significant but small positive correlation between ITP and thrombosis. Specifically, ITP patients exhibited a suggestive positive correlation with myocardial infarction and deep-vein thrombosis. However, our investigation did not identify any causal relationship between ITP and cerebral infarction, arterial embolism, other arterial embolisms, pulmonary embolism, thrombophlebitis, or portal vein thrombosis. Sensitivity analyses further confirmed the accuracy and robustness of these findings. This study presents empirical support for the causal relationship between ITP and thrombosis. It is important to note that a diminished platelet count does not serve as a preventive measure against thrombus formation. Consequently, when managing a newly diagnosed ITP patient, clinicians need to be aware that there is a slight elevation in the risk of thrombosis during treatment.",International journal of cardiology,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic; Thrombosis; Risk Factors",False,2

This study aims to investigate the associations between genetically predicted sarcopenia-related traits and stroke using a two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data for sarcopenia-related traits were acquired from the UK Biobank. Genetic associations for ischemic stroke (IS) and its subtypes were selected from the MEGASTROKE consortium comprising European ancestry participants. GWAS summary data for cerebral hemorrhage were obtained from the FinnGen consortium, including intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). MR estimates were calculated using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method. The robustness of results was assessed for heterogeneity and pleiotropy of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Higher appendicular lean mass (ALM) exhibited a potential causal association with a reduced incidence of large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) (odds ratio [OR] = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.71-0.93; P = 0.003) and small vessel disease (SVD) (OR = 0.83, 95% CI:0.74-0.94; P = 0.002). The associations of ALM with IS and ICH were compromised after adjusting for body fat and physical activity with multivariable MR. Two-step MR mediation analysis explored 33 candidate mediators, among which hypertension and SBP accounted for more than 10% of the mediation proportion in the relationship between ALM and stroke and its subtypes.

This study employs a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and meta-analysis to identify metabolite targets potentially associated with allergic diseases. A two-sample MR analysis was conducted to explore potential causal relationships between circulating and urinary metabolites and allergic diseases. Exposures were derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 486 circulating metabolites and a GWAS of 55 targeted urinary metabolites. Outcome data for allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic rhinitis (AR), and asthma, were obtained from the FinnGen biobank in Europe (cohort 1) and the Biobank Japan in Asia (cohort 2). MR results from both cohorts were combined using a meta-analysis. MR analysis identified 50 circulating metabolites and 6 urinary metabolites in cohort 1 and 54 circulating metabolites and 2 urinary metabolites in cohort 2 as potentially causally related to allergic diseases. A meta-analysis of the MR results revealed stearoylcarnitine (OR 8.654; 95% CI 4.399-17.025; P = 4.06E-10) and 1-arachidonoylglycerophosphoinositol (OR 2.178; 95% CI 1.388-3.419; P = 7.15E-04) as the most reliable causal circulating metabolites for asthma and AR, respectively.

This study was to investigate the potential causal impact of genetically predicted levels of magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), and omega-3 (ω-3) on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and its associated risk factors. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted. The genetic variations obtained from GWAS of individuals with European ancestry were found to be associated with the genetically predicted levels of Ca, Mg, Zn, Se, Fe, or ω-3. The data obtained from the FinnGen Consortium and MAGIC were utilized for the outcome of GWAS. The study found that there was a correlation between genetically predicted higher levels of Se and a reduced risk of insulin resistance, with a decrease of 2.2% according to random-effect IVW (OR 0.978, 95% CI 0.960-0.996, p = 0.015). The association between genetically determined mineral levels and PCOS was found to be limited, with an odds ratio (OR) ranging from 0.875 (95% CI: 0.637-1.202, p value = 0.411) for Ca. Limited scientific proof was found for the efficacy of other genetically determined mineral levels on hyperandrogenism, obesity, and insulin resistance.

FinnGen,38183343,Mendelian randomization study of lipid metabolism characteristics and migraine risk.,"The association between serum lipids and migraine is controversial. However, randomized controlled trials have suggested that statins may be efficacious for the prevention of migraine. In this study, we aim to investigate the relationship between lipids metabolism and migraine risk. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), relating to the serum lipid traits and the effect of lipid-lowering drugs that target APOB, CETP, HMGCR, NPC1L1, and PCSK9, were extracted from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data. The GWAS summary data were obtained from the Global Lipids Genetic Consortium (GLGC), the UK Biobank, and the FinnGen study, respectively. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to evaluate the association between serum lipid traits and lipid-lowering drugs with migraine risk. Regarding serum lipids, it was found that SNPs related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), or triglycerides (TG) levels were not associated with migraine, migraine with aura (MA) or migraine without aura (MO).

We aim to investigate the association between thyroid function levels and infertility in both females and males. A two-sample Mendelian randomization study was conducted using four methods, with the inverse variance weighted method (IVW) as the primary approach. Data on thyroid function as the exposure were obtained from the ThyroidOmics Consortium and UK Biobank, including over 700,000 individuals from a large meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for thyroid function and dysfunction.

GWAS is a powerful approach to identify links between genetic variants and phenotypic variation; however, identifying the genes driving associations identified in GWAS remains challenging. Integration of molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) such as expression QTL (eQTL) using mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses can help with the identification of causal genes. Careful interpretation remains warranted because eQTL can affect the expression of multiple genes within the same locus. We used a combination of genomic features that include variant annotation, activity-by-contact maps, MR, and colocalization with molQTL to prioritize causal genes across 4,611 disease GWAS and meta-analyses from biobank studies, namely FinnGen, Estonian Biobank and UK Biobank. Genes identified using this approach are enriched for gold standard causal genes and capture known biological links between disease genetics and biology. In addition, we find that eQTL colocalizing with GWAS are statistically enriched for corresponding disease-relevant tissues. We show that predicted directionality from MR is generally consistent with matched drug mechanism of actions (> 85% for approved drugs). Compared to the nearest gene mapping method, genes supported by multi-omics evidences displayed higher enrichment in approved therapeutic targets (risk ratio 1.75 vs. 2.58 for genes with the highest level of support). Finally, using this approach, we detected anassociation between the IL6 receptor signal transduction gene IL6ST and polymyalgia rheumatica, an indication for which sarilumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6, has been recently approved.

FinnGen,38681769,The genetic association between hyperthyroidism and heart failure: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Hyperthyroidism is an endocrine disease with multiple etiologies and manifestations. Heart failure (HF) is a common, costly, and deadly medical condition in clinical practice. Numerous studies have suggested that abnormal thyroid function can induce or aggravate the development of heart disease. However, no study has demonstrated a causal relationship between hyperthyroidism and heart failure. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the causal link between hyperthyroidism and HF. Summary data for genetically predicted hyperthyroidism were obtained from a genetic association study. The data examined for genetically determined all-cause heart failure came from 218,208 individuals from the FinnGen Consortium. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to estimate the causal link between hyperthyroidism and heart failure. Statistical analyses were conducted using the inverse variance-weighted, weighted median, simple median, weighted mode, MR-PRESSO (number of distribution = 5000), MR-Egger, and leave-one-out. The results of the inverse-variance weighted analysis indicated a causal association between hyperthyroidism and an increased risk of all-cause heart failure (IVW: β=0.048, OR=1.049, 95%CI: [1.013 to 1.087], P=0.007).

FinnGen,38287401,Correlations between genetically predicted lipid-lowering drug targets and inflammatory bowel disease.,"Millions of individuals globally suffer from Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). There is a dearth of large population-based investigations on lipid metabolism and IBDs, and it is unclear whether lipid-lowering drugs target IBDs causally. Consequently, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of lipid-lowering medication targets on the occurrence and progression of IBDs. Among the more than 400,000 participants in the UK Biobank cohort and the more than 170,000 participants in the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium, a total of nine genes linked to lipid-lowering drug targets were obtained (ABCG5/ABCG8, APOB, APOC3, LDLR, LPL, HMGCR, NPC1L1, PCSK9, and PPARA). IBD data were acquired from de Lange et al. (patients/sample size of IBDs: 25042/59957; ulcerative colitis (UC): 12366/45,975; Crohn's disease (CD): 12194/40,266) and the FinnGen cohort (patients/total sample size of IBDs: 4420/176,899; CD: 1520/171,906; UC: 3325/173,711). All four datasets were cross-combined for validation via Mendelian randomization analysis, and potential mediating factors were explored via mediation analysis. Genetically proxied APOC3 inhibition was related to increased IBD risk (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.87 (0.80-0.95); P < 0.01) and UC risk (0.83 (0.73-0.94); P < 0.01). IBD and CD risk were reduced by genetic mimicry of LDLR and LPL enhancements, respectively (odds ratioLDLR: 1.18 (1.03-1.36); P = 0.018; odds ratioCD: 1.26 (1.11-1.43); P = 2.60E-04). Genetically proxied HMGCR inhibition was associated with increased CD risk (0.68 (0.50-0.94); P = 0.018). These findings were confirmed through Mendelian analysis of the cross-combination of four separate datasets. APOC3-mediated triglyceride levels may contribute to IBDs partly through mediated triglycerides, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Clostridiaceae 1, or the Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group. LDLR enhancement may contribute to IBDs partly through increasing Lactobacillaceae. Vigilance is required to prevent adverse effects on IBDs (UC) for patients receiving volanesorsen (an antisense oligonucleotide targeting ApoC3 mRNA) and adverse effects on CD for statin users.

We used two-sample univariate and multivariate MR (MVMR) analyses to investigate the causal relationship between T1D or T2D and IPF. We obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for T1D and T2D from the European Bioinformatics Institute, comprising 29,652 T1D samples and 101,101 T1D single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 655,666 T2D samples and 5,030,727 T2D SNPs. We also used IPF GWAS data from the FinnGen Biobank comprising 198,014 IPF samples and 16,380,413 IPF SNPs. All cases and controls in these datasets were derived exclusively from European populations. In the univariate MR analysis, we employed inverse variance-weighted (IVW), weighted median (WM), and MR-Egger regression methods.

The present study, therefore, aimed to investigate the potential relationship between osteoporosis and intervertebral disc degeneration using Mendelian randomization and genome-wide association analyses. Specifically, the impact of bone mineral density on the development of intervertebral disc degeneration was evaluated. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data of OP/BMDs and IVDD were collected from the FinnGen consortium, the GEFOS consortium, and MRC-IEU. The relationship between IVDD and OP was then explored using TSMR. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was adopted as the primary effect estimate, and the reliability and stability of the results were validated using various methods, including MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, weighted mode, and MR-PRESSO. No significant causal relationship was observed between OP and IVDD (IVW, P > 0.05) or between femoral neck BMD (FA-BMD) and IVDD when OP and FA-BMD were used as exposures. However, increased levels of total body BMD (TB-BMD) and lumbar spine BMD (LS-BMD) were revealed as significant risk factors for IVDD (TB-BMD: IVW, OR = 1.201, 95% CI: 1.123-1.284,  OP and the level of FA-BMD were revealed to have no causal relationship with IVDD. The increased levels of TB-BMD and LS-BMD could promote the occurrence of IVDD. Both eBMD and FN-BMD have potential causal relationships with the risk of IVDD. No significant relationship exists between IVDD and the risk of OP. Further research is warranted to comprehensively comprehend the molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of OP and BMD on IVDD and vice versa.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024,"Humans; Intervertebral Disc Degeneration; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Bone Density; Osteoporosis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Female; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Male",False,2
FinnGen,38970068,Causal relationship between bone mineral density and intervertebral disc degeneration: a univariate and multivariable mendelian randomization study.,"Although previous studies have suggested a possible association between bone mineral density (BMD) and intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), the causal relationship between them remains unclear. Evidence from accumulating studies indicates that they might mutually influence one another. However, observational studies may be affected by potential confounders. Meanwhile, Mendelian randomization (MR) study can overcome these confounders to assess causality. This Mendelian randomization (MR) study aimed to explore the causal effect of bone mineral density (BMD) on intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Summary data from genome-wide association studies of bone mineral density (BMD) and IDD (the FinnGen biobank) have been acquired. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was utilized as the primary MR analysis approach. Weighted median, MR-Egger regression, weighted mode, and simple mode were used as supplements. The Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) and MR-Egger regression were performed to assess horizontal pleiotropy. Cochran's Q test evaluated heterogeneity. Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was further conducted to determine the reliability of the causal relationship. Multivariate MR (MVMR) analyses used multivariable inverse variance-weighted methods to individually and jointly adjust for four potential confounders, body mass index (BMI), Type2 diabetes, hyperthyroidism and smoking. A reverse MR analysis was conducted to assess potential reverse causation. In the univariate MR analysis, femoral neck bone mineral density (FNBMD), heel bone mineral density (eBMD), lumbar spine bone mineral density (LSBMD), and total body bone mineral density (TB BMD) had a direct causal effect on intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) [FNBMD-related analysis: OR(95%CI) = 1.17 (1.04 to 1.31), p = 0.008, eBMD-related analysis: OR(95%CI) = 1.06 (1.01 to 1.12), p = 0.028, LSBMD-related analysis: OR(95%CI) = 1.20 (1.10 to 1.31), p = 3.38E-7,TB BMD-related analysis: OR(95%CI) = 1.20 (1.12 to 1.29), p = 1.0E-8]. In the MVMR analysis, it was revealed that, even after controlling for confounding factors, heel bone mineral density (eBMD), lumbar spine bone mineral density (LSBMD), and total body bone mineral density (TB BMD) still maintained an independent and significant causal association with IDD(Adjusting for heel bone mineral density: beta = 0.073, OR95% CI = 1.08(1.02 to 1.14), P = 0.013; Adjusting for lumbar spine bone mineral density: beta = 0.11, OR(95%CI) = 1.12(1.02 to 1.23), P = 0.03; Adjusting for total body bone mineral density: beta = 0.139, OR95% CI = 1.15(1.06 to 1.24), P = 5.53E - 5). In the reverse analysis, no evidence was found to suggest that IDD has an impact on BMD. The findings from our univariate and multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis establish a substantial positive causal association between BMD and IDD, indicating that higher bone mineral density may be a significant risk factor for intervertebral disc degeneration. Notably, no causal effect of IDD on these four measures of bone mineral density was observed.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but evidence is mixed regarding causality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential causal relationships of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism with cardiovascular outcomes, including atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and ischemic stroke, as well as their effect on cardiac structure and function assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A comprehensive 2-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was performed using summary data from large-scale meta-analyses of European ancestry individuals. Genetically determined lower TSH levels (odds ratio 0.928; 95% confidence interval 0.884-0.974; P = .003) and genetic risk of hyperthyroidism (odds ratio 1.049; 95% confidence interval 1.016-1.083; P = .003) were associated with increased AF risk. These associations remained significant even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. Colocalization and multivariable Mendelian randomization revealed height as a key mediator between TSH/hyperthyroidism and AF. These findings were further corroborated in the independent FinnGen cohort. However, no clear evidence was found for relationships between thyroid function and other cardiovascular outcomes and cardiac structure and function. Our study shows that reduced TSH levels and hyperthyroidism heighten AF risk, with height serving as an important mediator in these associations. The primary focus of thyroid management in cardiovascular health should be on preventing and treating arrhythmias, particularly AF.

We utilized meta-analysis of observational studies and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to elucidate the association between body mass index (BMI) and MT. In meta-analysis, a search was performed on June 27, 2022, using PubMed and Embase databases. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were extracted from included studies. In MR analyses, the research utilized summary-level data on BMI and MT obtained from Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits and the FinnGen Consortium, respectively. In meta-analysis, four studies comprising 826,383 participants were included. The pooled odds ratio of MT in the high BMI group was 1.32 (95% confidence interval, 0.83-2.09), compared with the nonhigh BMI group. The pooled odds ratio in the under 30 group was 1.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.61-5.03). In MR analyses, one standard deviation increase in genetically predicted BMI was associated with meniscus derangement as a chronic subtype of MT (odds ratio, 1.36; 95% confidential interval, 1.17-1.59).

However, there is still limited understanding of the exact impacts of LTL on these diseases. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the genetic causal association between LTL and female reproductive endocrine diseases by employing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Instruments for assessing genetic variation associated with exposure and outcome were derived from summary data of published genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) was utilized as the main analysis method to investigate the causal relationship between LTL and female reproductive endocrine diseases. The exposure data were obtained from the UK Biobanks GWAS dataset, comprising 472,174 participants of European ancestry. The outcome data were acquired from the FinnGen consortium, including abnormal uterine bleeding (menorrhagia and oligomenorrhea), endometriosis (ovarian endometrioma and adenomyosis), infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Furthermore, to account for potential confounding factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, insomnia, body mass index (BMI) and a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was also conducted. Lastly, a series of pleiotropy tests and sensitivity analyses were performed to ensure the reliability and robustness of our findings. P < 0.0063 was considered to indicate statistically significant causality following Bonferroni correction. Our univariable MR analysis demonstrated that longer LTL was causally associated with an increased risk of menorrhagia (IVW: odds ratio [OR]: 1.1803; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0880-1.2804; P = 0.0001) and ovarian endometrioma (IVW: OR: 1.2946; 95%CI: 1.0970-1.5278; P = 0.0022) at the Bonferroni significance level. However, no significant correlation was observed between LTL and oligomenorrhea (IVW: OR: 1.0124; 95%CI: 0.7350-1.3946; P = 0.9398), adenomyosis (IVW: OR: 1.1978; 95%CI: 0.9983-1.4372; P = 0.0522), infertility (IVW: OR: 1.0735; 95%CI: 0.9671-1.1915; P = 0.1828), PCOS (IVW: OR: 1.0633; 95%CI: 0.7919-1.4278; P = 0.6829), POI (IVW: OR: 0.8971; 95%CI: 0.5644-1.4257; P = 0.6459) or PMS (IVW: OR: 0.7749; 95%CI: 0.4137-1.4513; P = 0.4256). Reverse MR analysis indicated that female reproductive endocrine diseases have no causal effect on LTL. MVMR analysis suggested that the causal effect of LTL on menorrhagia and ovarian endometrioma remained significant after accounting for smoking, alcohol consumption, insomnia, BMI and a history of PID. Pleiotropic and sensitivity analyses also showed robustness of our results. The results of our bidirectional two-sample MR analysis revealed that genetically predicted longer LTL significantly increased the risk of menorrhagia and ovarian endometrioma, which is consistent with the findings from MVMR studies. However, we did not notice any significant effects of LTL on oligomenorrhea, adenomyosis, infertility, PCOS, POI or PMS. Additionally, reproductive endocrine disorders were found to have no impact on LTL. To enhance our understanding of the effect and underlying mechanism of LTL on female reproductive endocrine diseases, further large-scale studies are warranted in the future.",Journal of ovarian research,2024,"Humans; Female; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Telomere; Telomere Homeostasis; Genital Diseases, Female",False,8

In this study, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was used as the instrumental variable for Mendelian analysis, and the SNP data of GCA and PMR were obtained from the FinnGen Biobank databases. SNPs are significantly correlated with GCA and PMR and were screened based on preset thresholds. Inverse variance weighted analysis was used as the main analysis, supplemented with MR-Egger and weighted median. The evidence of the impact of GCA on PMR risk was found in inverse variance weighted results (odds ratio, 1.22 [95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.34]; P < .01), and the evidence of the impact of PMR on GCA risk has also been found (odds ratio, 1.58 [95% confidence interval, 1.28-1.96]; P < .01). Finally, the stability and reliability of the results were tested using the retention method, heterogeneity test, and horizontal gene pleiotropy test. MR analysis indicates that GCA increases the risk of PMR and PMR is an important risk factor for GCA, with a causal relationship. The potential value of reasonable management of PMR in patients with GCA has received high attention.

To test whether in situ and invasive melanoma have independent heritable components, genetic effect estimates were calculated for single-nucleotide variants (SNV; formerly single-nucleotide polymorphisms) throughout the genome for each melanoma. Then, SNV-based heritability was estimated, the genetic correlation between melanoma subtypes was assessed, and polygenic risk scores (PRS) were generated for in situ vs invasive status in Q-MEGA participants. A total of 6 genome-wide significant loci associated with in situ melanoma and 18 loci with invasive melanoma were identified. A strong genetic correlation (genetic r = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.76-1.15) was observed between the 2 classifications. Notably, loci near IRF4, KLF4, and HULC had significantly larger effects for in situ melanoma compared with invasive melanoma, while MC1R had a significantly larger effect on invasive melanoma compared with in situ melanoma. Heritability estimates were consistent for both, with in situ melanoma heritability of 6.7% (95% CI, 4.1-9.3) and invasive melanoma heritability of 4.9% (95% CI, 2.8-7.2). Finally, a PRS, derived from comparing invasive melanoma with in situ melanoma genetic risk, was on average significantly higher in participants with invasive melanoma (odds ratio per 1-SD increase in PRS, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.16-1.77). There is much shared genetic architecture between in situ melanoma and invasive melanoma. Despite indistinguishable heritability estimates between the melanoma classifications, PRS suggest germline genetics may influence whether a person gets in situ melanoma or invasive melanoma. PRS could potentially help stratify populations based on invasive melanoma risk, informing future screening programs without exacerbating the current burden of melanoma overdiagnosis.",JAMA dermatology,2024,"Humans; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Germ-Line Mutation; Melanoma; Melanoma, Cutaneous Malignant; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Skin Neoplasms",False,8

This study investigates the causal relationship between various types of fluid intake and urolithiasis using univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) approaches. Genetic data for urolithiasis were obtained from the FinnGen Consortium (n = 400,681), while genetic measures for nine fluid types were sourced from meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The analysis revealed that genetically predicted coffee intake (OR: 0.571, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.341-0.958, p = 0.034) and ground coffee intake (OR: 0.219, 95% CI: 0.005-0.923, p = 0.038) were protective factors for upper urinary calculi. Additionally, a standard deviation (SD) increase in tea intake was associated with a 53% reduction in risk (OR: 0.473, 95% CI: 0.320-0.700, p < 0.001). Conversely, milk intake (OR: 1.072, 95% CI: 1.018-1.130) and alcohol intakefrequency (OR: 1.304, 95% CI: 1.083-1.570, p = 0.005) increased the risk of upper urinary calculi.

However, the potential association between gut microbiota and prostate disorders is still uncertain. We first identified groups of gut microbiota based on the phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels from consortium MiBioGen. And we acquired prostate diseases statistics from the FINNGEN study and PRACTICAL consortium. Next, two-sample Mendelian randomization was used to investigate the potential associations between three prevalent prostate disease and gut microbiota. In addition, we performed a reverse MR analysis and Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) test for further research. We investigated the connection between 196 gut microbiota and three prevalent prostate diseases. We identified 42 nominally significant associations and 2 robust causative links. Upon correction for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, our analysis revealed a positive correlation between the risk of prostatitis and the presence of the taxonomic order Gastranaerophilales. Conversely, the risk of prostate cancer exhibited an inverse correlation with the presence of the taxonomic class Alphaproteobacteria. Our study revealed the potential association between gut microbiota and prostate diseases.

FinnGen,38780189,Association of sleep traits with risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: a mendelian randomization study.,"Unhealthy sleep patterns are common during pregnancy and have been associated with an increased risk of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) in observational studies. However, the causality underlying these associations remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the potential causal association between seven sleep traits and the risk of HDPs using a two-sample Mendelian randomization study. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics were obtained from the FinnGen consortium, UK Biobank, and other prominent consortia, with a focus on individuals of European ancestry. The primary analysis utilized an inverse-variance-weighted MR approach supplemented by sensitivity analyses to mitigate potential biases introduced by pleiotropy. Furthermore, a two-step MR framework was employed for mediation analyses. The data analyzed included 200 000-500 000 individuals for each sleep trait, along with approximately 15 000 cases of HDPs. Genetically predicted excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) exhibited a significant association with an increased risk of HDPs [odds ratio (OR) 2.96, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.40-6.26], and the specific subtype of preeclampsia/eclampsia (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.06-8.3). Similarly, genetically predicted obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was associated with a higher risk of HDPs (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09-1.47). Sensitivity analysis validated the robustness of these associations. Mediation analysis showed that BMI mediated approximately 25% of the association between EDS and HDPs, while mediating up to approximately 60% of the association between OSA and the outcomes. No statistically significant associations were observed between other genetically predicted sleep traits, such as chronotype, daytime napping, sleep duration, insomnia, snoring, and the risk of HDPs. Our findings suggest a causal association between two sleep disorders, EDS and OSA, and the risk of HDPs, with BMI acting as a crucial mediator. EDS and OSA demonstrate promise as potentially preventable risk factors for HDPs, and targeting BMI may represent an alternative treatment strategy to mitigate the adverse impact of sleep disorders.",Journal of hypertension,2024,"Humans; Female; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Pregnancy; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Genome-Wide Association Study; Risk Factors; Sleep",False,3

To examine the potential causal relationships between CAD, MI, and urate levels with AA, AAA, TAA, AD, respectively, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Genetic instruments that reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10 - 8) for risk factors were obtained from genome-wide association studies(GWASs) conducted on individuals of European origin. On the other hand, genetic instruments of AA, AAA, TAA or AD were chosen from the FinnGen cohort. The primary analysis employed the inverse-variance weighted MR method, while sensitivity analyses were conducted using MR-Egger, weighted median MR, MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier, and Phenoscanner searching. In addition, we performed the MR-Egger intercept analysis to identify potential pleiotropy and utilized Cochran's Q statistics to evaluate heterogeneity. Additionally, we conducted bidirectional Mendelian randomization experiments to mitigate the potential influence of reverse causation. According to the results of our study, there were statistically significant higher risks for AA in relation to CAD/MI(odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.309 (1.150-1.490), and 1.255 (1.147-1.373).

A two-sample MR analysis was conducted using summary-level data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Two sets of polygenic instruments strongly associated (p < 5 × 10 The IVW analysis conducted across four groups confirms no significant causal relationship between SUA concentration and OP: UKB-UKB (OR: 1.001, 95% CI: 0.999-1.003, p=0.464), CKD-UKB (OR: 1.001, 95% CI: 0.999-1.003, p=0.349), UKB-Fin (OR: 0.934, 95% CI: 0.747-1.168, p=0.549), CKD-Fin (OR: 1.041, 95%CI: 0.934-1.161, p=0.470). Furthermore, additional four MR analyses corroborated these findings. Upon excluding all outliers identified by the MR-PRESSO test, no significant directional pleiotropy was observed, except for some data heterogeneity noted in the UKB-UKB group (Q=50.65, P=0.002). Additionally, a leave-one-out analysis indicated that no single SNP exerted undue influence on the results.

FinnGen,39582071,Unveiling therapeutic targets for spinal stenosis from genetic insights: a Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Spinal stenosis is a commonly chronic spinal degenerative disease, which is a major cause of pain and dysfunction in the elderly. Mendelian randomization (MR) has been widely applied to repurpose licensed drugs and identify novel therapeutic targets. Consequently, we intended to identify new therapeutic targets for spinal stenosis and to analyze their possible mechanisms and potential side effects.We conducted the Mendelian randomization analysis to identify potential drug targets for the management of spinal stenosis. Cis-expressed quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) data as genetic instrumental variables were acquired from the eQTLGen consortium. The summary statistics for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations of spinal stenosis were obtained from the FinnGen study(20,807 cases and 294,770 controls). Co-localization analysis was performed to determine whether there was shared causal variation between the SNPs associated with spinal stenosis as well as the eQTL. Multiple external validations were performed to reinforce the reliability and stability of the findings utilizing the cis-eQTL from the GTEx portal, the Ferkingstad et al. pQTL dataset, and the Sun et al. pQTL dataset. The viability of the identified drug targets for future clinical applications was elucidated through the phenome-wide association study and drug candidate prediction. Three drug targets (BMP6, DLK1, and GFPT1) exhibited significant causal associations with spinal stenosis in the eQTLGen cohort by MR analysis, which was strongly supported by the results of the co-localization analysis. The causal association of DLK1 and GFPT1 with spinal stenosis remained remarkable with multiple external validations. Multivariate MR and phenome-wide association study analysis indicated that both targets were not associated with other traits. In addition, phenome-wide association study analysis and drug prediction analysis demonstrated the potential of these two targets for future clinical applications. In this study, DLK1 and GFPT1 were identified as promising novel therapeutic targets for spinal stenosis, providing initial genetic insights for drug development in spinal stenosis.",Scientific reports,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Spinal Stenosis; Quantitative Trait Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genetic Predisposition to Disease",False,2
FinnGen,38016486,Exploring the causal relationship between periodontitis and gut microbiome: Unveiling the oral-gut and gut-oral axes through bidirectional Mendelian randomization.,"This Mendelian randomization (MR) study was performed to explore the potential bidirectional causal relationship between the gut microbiome (GM) and periodontitis. We used genetic instruments from the genome-wide association study of European descent for periodontitis from the GeneLifestyle Interactions in Dental Endpoints (GLIDE) consortium (17,353 cases and 28,210 controls) and the FinnGen consortium (4434 cases and 259,234 controls) to investigate the causal relationship with GM (the MiBioGen consortium, 18,340 samples), and vice versa. Several MR techniques, which include inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode and weighted mode approaches, were employed to investigate the causal relationship between the exposures and the outcomes. Cochran's Q-test was performed to detect heterogeneity. The MR-Egger regression intercept and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier test (MR-PRESSO) were conducted to test potential horizontal pleiotropy. Leave-one-out sensitivity analyses were used to assess the stabilities of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Finally, the IVW results from the two databases were analysed using meta-analysis. We confirmed three potential causal relationships between GM taxa and periodontitis at the genus level. Among them, the genera Alistipes and Holdemanella were genetically associated with an increased risk of periodontitis. In reverse, periodontitis may lead to a decreased abundance of the genus Ruminococcaceae UCG014.

This study applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate this relationship. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics on H. pylori infection [sample size=8735 (EBI, https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/ )] and SS [sample size=368,028 (cases=2495, controls=365533) (FinnGen, https://r9.finngen.fi/ )] were analyzed. We used bidirectional MR to evaluate the association between H. pylori infection and SS and identify causation. The major MR analysis method was inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR, supplemented by MR‒Egger and weighted median approaches. In addition, the stability and reliability of the results were tested using the retention method, heterogeneity test, and horizontal gene pleiotropy test. Evidence of the impact of H. pylori infection on SS risk was found in the IVW results [odds ratio (OR)=1.6705; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.0966 to 2.5446; P=0.0168]. Evidence of the impact of SS on H. pylori infection risk was also found (OR=1.0158; 95% CI=1.0033 to 1.0285; P=0.0128). The results of MR analysis support a causal association between H. pylori infection and SS and indicate that SS can lead to a greater risk of H. pylori infection.

FinnGen,38907314,Dietary factors in relation to hypertension: a mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies have elucidated the associations between dietary factors and hypertension. Nevertheless, the exploration of these relationships using Mendelian randomization remains scarce currently. The Mendelian randomization approach investigated the potential causal relationships between 16 dietary factors and hypertension. To achieve this, we identified genetic variants associated with these dietary factors by utilizing data from European-descent genome-wide association studies with a stringent significance threshold (P < 5 × 10 - 8). Subsequently, we obtained genetic associations with hypertension from the extensive FinnGen Study, encompassing 92,462 cases and 265,626 controls. Our primary analytical method was the inverse variance weighted method, and we also conducted assessments for heterogeneity and pleiotropy to ensure the robustness and reliability of our findings. The study revealed significant associations with hypertension risk for various dietary factors. Specifically, higher weekly alcohol consumption (OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.19-1.96) and more frequent alcohol intake (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.08-1.33) were positively correlated with an increased risk of hypertension. Likewise, increased poultry intake (OR: 3.25, 95% CI: 1.83-5.78) and beef intake (OR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.09-2.97) were also linked to a higher risk of hypertension. Conversely, there were protective factors associated with a decreased risk of hypertension. These included consuming salad and raw vegetables, dried fruits, cheese, and cereals. It is important to note that no evidence of pleiotropy was detected, underscoring the robustness of these findings. This study uncovered causal relationships between various dietary factors and hypertension risk. Specifically, alcohol consumption in terms of drinks per week and intake frequency, as well as poultry and beef intake, were causally associated with an elevated risk of hypertension. In contrast, consuming salad/raw vegetables, dried fruits, cheese, and cereals demonstrated an inverse causal association with hypertension, suggesting a potential protective effect.","Journal of health, population, and nutrition",2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Hypertension; Diet; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alcohol Drinking; Risk Factors; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Animals; Female; Vegetables; Fruit; Poultry",False,2

We performed a Mendelian randomization study (MR) to assess the causal effects of gut microbiota on MS. Independent genetic variants associated with 211 gut microbiota phenotypes were selected as instrumental variables from the largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) previously published by the MiBioGen study. GWAS data for MS were obtained from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) for primary analysis and the FinnGen consortium for replication and collaborative analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate heterogeneity and pleiotropy. After inverse-variance-weighted and sensitivity analysis filtering, seven gut microbiota with potential causal effects on MS were identified from the IMSGC. Only five metabolites remained significant associations with MS when combined with the FinnGen consortium, including genus Anaerofilum id.2053 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.141, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.021-1.276, p = .021), Ruminococcus2 id.11374 (OR = 1.190, 95% CI: 1.007-1.406, p = .042), Ruminococcaceae UCG003 id.11361 (OR = 0.822, 95% CI: 0.688-0.982, p = .031), Ruminiclostridium5 id.11355 (OR = 0.724, 95% CI: 0.585-0.895, p = .003), Anaerotruncus id.2054 (OR = 0.772, 95% CI: 0.634-0.940, p = .010).

However, the exact causal relationships among the gut microbiota, metabolites, and HIV infection remain poorly understood. Our study involving Mendelian randomization (MR) and mediation analysis aims to unveil these causalities. Genetic instrumental variables for the gut microbiota were retrieved from MiBioGen consortium (n = 18,340). Metabolism-related genetic variants were sourced from the CLSA cohort (n = 8299). GWAS summary statistics for symptomatic HIV infection were derived from the FinnGen study (n = 309,154), and the UK Biobank (n = 208,808). We performed the bidirectional two-sample MR to assess causalities with the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary analysis. Moreover, we executed a mediation analysis using two-step MR methods. Compared to the causal effects of HIV infection on gut microbiota (or metabolites), those of gut microbiota (or plasma metabolites) on the risk of HIV infection were more substantial. Phylum Proteobacteria (OR: 2.114, 95% CI 1.042-4.288, P = 0.038), and genus Ruminococcaceae UCG013 (OR: 2.127, 95% CI 1.080-4.191, P = 0.029) exhibited an adverse causal effect on HIV infection, whereas genus Clostridium sensu stricto 1(OR: 0.491, 95% CI 0.252-0.956, P = 0.036) and family Erysipelotrichaceae (OR: 0.399, 95% CI 0.193-0.827, P = 0.013) acted as significant protective factors for HIV. The salicyluric glucuronide level (OR = 2.233, 95% CI 1.120-4.453, P = 0.023) exhibited a considerably adverse causal effect on HIV infection. Conversely, the salicylate-to-citrate ratio (OR: 0.417, 95% CI 0.253-0.688, P = 0.001) was identified as a protective factor for HIV. We identified only one bidirectional causality between 1-palmitoyl-GPI and HIV infection. Mechanistically, genus Haemophilus mediated the causal effects of three phospholipids on HIV infection risk: 1-palmitoyl-GPI (mediation proportion = 33.7%, P = 0.018), 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPI (mediation proportion = 18.3%, P = 0.019), and 1-linoleoyl-2-linolenoyl-GPC (mediation proportion = 20.3%, P = 0.0216). Additionally, 5-Dodecenoylcarnitine (C12:1) mediated the causal effect of genus Sellimonas on the risk of HIV infection (mediation proportion = 13.7%, P = 0.0348). Our study revealed that gut microbiota and metabolites causally influence HIV infection risk more substantially than the reverse.

Independent genetic variants strongly associated with 20 lifestyle factors were selected as instrumental variables from corresponding genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Summary-level data for migraine were obtained from the FinnGen consortium (18,477 cases and 287,837 controls) as a discovery set and the GWAS meta-analysis data (26,052 cases and 487,214 controls) as a replication set. Estimates derived from the two datasets were combined using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Two-step univariable MR (UVMR) and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analyses were conducted to evaluate 19 potential mediators of association and determine the proportions of these mediators. The combined effect of inverse variance weighted revealed that a one standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted Leisure screen time (LST) was associated with a 27.7% increase (95% CI: 1.14-1.44) in migraine risk, while Moderate or/and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was associated with a 26.9% decrease (95% CI: 0.61-0.87) in migraine risk. The results of the mediation analysis indicated that out of the 19 modifiable metabolic risk factors examined, hypertension explains 24.81% of the relationship between LST and the risk of experiencing migraine. Furthermore, hypertension and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) partially weaken the association between MVPA and migraines, mediating 4.86% and 4.66% respectively.

We tried to apply genome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and figure out reliable gene susceptibility of urolithiasis from the largest samples to date in two independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) database of European ancestry. We extracted summary statistics of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) from eQTLGen consortium. Urolithiasis phenotype information was obtained from both FinnGen Biobank and UK Biobank. Multiple two-sample MR analysis with a Bonferroni-corrected P threshold (P < 2.5e-06) was conducted. The primary endpoint was the causal effect calculated by random-effect inverse variance weighted (IVW) method. Sensitivity analysis, volcano plots, scatter plots, and regional plots were also performed and visualized. After multiple MR tests between 19942 eQTLs and urolithiasis phenotype from both cohorts, 30 common eQTLs with consistent effect size direction were found to be causally associated with urolithiasis risk. Finally only one gene (LMAN2) was simultaneously identified among all top significant eQTLs from both FinnGen Biobank (beta = 0.6758, se = 0.0327, P = 6.775e-95) and UK Biobank (beta = 0.0044, se = 0.0009, P = 2.417e-06). We also found that LMAN2 was with the largest beta effect size on urolithiasis phenotype from the two cohorts.

We obtained GWAS summary data for 35 interleukins from eight independent large-scale serum proteome studies of European ancestry populations and for 23 common cancers from the FinnGen Consortium. We then conducted a multicenter Mendelian Randomization (MR) study to explore the relationship between systemic inflammatory status and cancers. 24 causal associations between interleukins and cancers were supported by multicenter data, 18 of which were reported for the first time. Our results indicated that IL-1α (Hodgkin lymphoma), IL-5 (bladder cancer), IL-7 (prostate cancer), IL-11 (bone malignant tumor), IL-16 (lung cancer), IL-17A (pancreatic cancer), IL-20 (bladder cancer), IL-22 (lymphocytic leukemia), IL-34 (breast cancer), IL-36β (prostate cancer), and IL-36γ (liver cancer) were risk factors for related cancers. Conversely, IL-9 (malignant neoplasms of the corpus uteri), IL-17C (liver cancer), and IL-31 (colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, and cutaneous melanoma) exhibited protective effects against related cancers. Notably, the dual effects of serum interleukins were also observed. IL-18 acted as a risk factor for prostate cancer, however, was a protective factor against laryngeal cancer. Similarly, IL-19 promoted the development of lung cancer and myeloid leukemia, while conferring protection against Breast, cervical, and thyroid cancers.

Nonetheless, the genetic causality underlying this association remains unknown. This research employed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the potential causal associations between PFASs exposure and APOs risk. PFASs data were sourced from the GWAS Catalog, and APOs data were retrieved from the FinnGen consortium. Causal estimation primarily employed inverse variance weighting, with Cochran's Q test for instrumental variable heterogeneity, and MR-Egger, MR-PRESSO, and leave-one-out tests for sensitivity analyses. The possibility of reverse causality was investigated through reverse MR. MR evidence revealed a notable correlation between perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and abruptio placentae (OR=1.498, P=0.026), as well as short gestation and low birth weight (OR=1.720, P=0.013). Exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) increased the risk of preeclampsia or eclampsia (OR=1.128, P=0.030) and gestational hypertension (OR=1.076, P=0.049), but decreased the risk of premature rupture of membranes (OR=0.916, P=0.033). The results obtained were consistent across various sensitivity analyses. Reverse MR results was negative. These findings may provide a reference for prevention strategies and intervention measures for PFASs exposure and APOs, and provide a framework for studying the causal effects of environmental pollutant exposure and human diseases.",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2024,Pregnancy; Female; Fluorocarbons; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Humans; Pregnancy Outcome; Maternal Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Caprylates; Alkanesulfonic Acids,False,3

Summary-level data for CRC were obtained from the UK Biobank (5,657 cases and 372,016 controls), FinnGen cohort (3,022 cases and 215,770 controls), and BioBank Japan Project (BBJ, 7,062 cases and 195,745 controls). Thirty-two peripheral markers with consistent definitions were collected from the three biobanks. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to evaluate the causal effect of circulating factors on CRC. The effects from the three consortiums were combined using trans-ancestry meta-analysis methods. Our analysis provided compelling evidence for the causal association of higher genetically predicted eosinophil cell count (EOS, odds ratio [OR], 0.8639; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7922-0.9421) and red cell distribution width (RDW, OR, 0.9981; 95% CI, 0.9972-0.9989) levels with a decreased risk of CRC. Additionally, we found suggestive evidence indicating that higher levels of total cholesterol (TC, OR, 1.0022; 95% CI, 1.0002-1.0042) may increase the risk of CRC. Conversely, higher levels of platelet count (PLT, OR, 0.9984; 95% CI, 0.9972-0.9996), total protein (TP, OR, 0.9445; 95% CI, 0.9037-0.9872), and C-reactive protein (CRP, OR, 0.9991; 95% CI, 0.9983-0.9999) may confer a protective effect against CRC. Moreover, we identified six ancestry-specific causal factors, indicating the necessity of considering patients' ancestry backgrounds before formulating prevention strategies.

The present study aims at evaluating the association between circulating inflammatory cytokines and risk of IA under a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design. For primary analysis, summary statistics of inflammatory regulators was obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) comprising 8293 Finnish participants. Summary data of IA were extracted from a GWAS which comprised 7495 cases and 71,934 controls in European descent. For targeted analysis, summary statistics were extracted from two proteomic studies, which recruit 3301 and 5368 European participants, respectively. Summary data of IA were acquired from FinnGen study with 5342 cases and 342,673 controls. We employed inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as main approach, with sensitivity analyses using weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO methods. Reverse MR analyses were conducted to minimize bias from reverse causality. No causation of cytokines with IA subtypes was identified in both primary and targeted analysis after Bonferroni correction.

We chose to employ Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the potential correlation between immune cells and AS. We sourced the data on immune cells from the latest genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We obtained data on AS from the FinnGen consortium. Our comprehensive univariable MR analysis covered 731 immune cells to explore its potential causal relationship with AS. The primary analysis method was inverse-variance weighted (IVW). Additionally, we used Cochran's Q test and the MR-Egger intercept test to assess the presence of pleiotropy and heterogeneity. We examined whether our results could be influenced by individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the leave-one-out test. We conducted a bidirectional MR to investigate the reverse relationship. We also applied multivariable MR to decrease the potential influence between the immune cells. Overall, our univariable MR analysis revealed eight immune cells associated with AS.

However, the causal nature of this relationship is unclear. We performed a two-way two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate potential causal relationships between leukocytes and inflammatory skin diseases. The circulating white blood cell count, basophil cell count, leukocyte cell count, lymphocyte cell count, eosinophil cell count, and neutrophil cell count data were obtained from the Blood Cell Consortium (BCX). The data for inflammatory skin disorders, including acne, atopic dermatitis (AD), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis (SD), were obtained from the FinnGen Consortium R10. The primary analysis utilized inverse variance weighting (IVW) along with additional methods such as MR-Egger, weighted mode, and weighted median estimator. To assess heterogeneity among instrument variables, Cochran's Q test was employed, while MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO were used to test for horizontal pleiotropy. IVW demonstrated that an elevated monocyte count was significantly associated with a decreased risk of psoriasis (OR = 0.897, 95% CI: 0.841-0.957, P = 0.001, FDR = 0.016). Additionally, an increased eosinophil count was causally associated with a higher risk of AD (OR = 1.188, 95% CI: 1.093-1.293, P = 0.000, FDR = 0.002). No inverse causal relationship between inflammatory skin disease and circulating white blood cell count was found. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that increased monocyte count is associated with a reduced risk of psoriasis and that there is a causal relationship between increased eosinophil counts and an increased risk of AD.

FinnGen,38438963,Causal effects of gut microbiome on HIV infection: a two-sample mendelian randomization analysis.,"The causal association between gut microbiome and HIV infection remains to be elucidated. We conducted a two-sample mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causality between gut microbiome and HIV infection. Publicly released genome-wide association studies summary data were collected to perform the mendelian analysis. The GWAS summary data of gut microbiome was retrieved from the MiBioGen consortium, which contains 18 340 samples from 24 cohorts. GWAS summary data of HIV infection was collected from the R5 release of FinnGen consortium, including 357 HIV infected cases and 218 435 controls. The SNPs were selected as instrumental variables according to our selection rules. And SNPs with a F-statistics less than ten were regarded as weak instrumental variables and excluded. Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted by five methods, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode. The Cochran's Q test and MR-Egger intercept test were performed to identify heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Leave-one-out analysis were used to test the sensitivity of the results. Fifteen gut microbiota taxa showed causal effects on HIV infection according to the MR methods. Four taxa were observed to increase the risk of HIV infection, including Ruminococcaceae (OR: 2.468[1.043, 5.842], P: 0.039), Ruminococcaceae UCG005 (OR: 2.051[1.048, 4.011], P: 0.036), Subdoligranulum (OR: 3.957[1.762, 8.887], P < 0.001) and Victivallis (OR: 1.605[1.012, 2.547], P=0.044). Erysipelotrichaceae was protective factor of HIV infection (OR: 0.278[0.106, 0.731], P < 0.001) and Methanobrevibacter was also found to be associated with reduced risk of HIV infection (OR: 0.509[0.265, 0.980], P=0.043). Horizontal pleiotropy was found for Fusicatenibacter (P<0.05) according to the MR-Egger regression intercept analysis. No heterogeneity was detected. Our results demonstrate significant causal effects of gut microbiome on HIV infection. These findings facilitate future studies to develop better strategies for HIV prophylaxis through gut microbiome regulation.

FinnGen,38941394,The impact of educational attainment on mental health: A Causal Assessment from the UKB and FinnGen Cohorts.,"Observational studies report inverse associations between educational attainment and depression/anxiety risks, but confounding hinders causal inference. This study aimed to assess potential causal relationships using Mendelian randomization (MR). Two-sample MR analysis was conducted using genetic instruments for education, smoking, body mass index, and physical activity from published genome-wide association studies. Depression and anxiety data came from the UK Biobank ([UKB] 117,782 individuals) and FinnGen (215,644 individuals) cohorts. Inverse variance weighted regression determined associations between exposures and mental health outcomes. Increased educational attainment was causally associated with reduced risks of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 0.99 per year, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.990-0.996, P < .001) and anxiety (OR = 0.99, CI: 0.98-0.991, P < .001) in both cohorts. Smoking initiation conferred higher risks of depression (UKB OR = 1.05, CI: 1.03-1.06, P < .001; FinnGen OR = 1.20, CI: 1.10-1.32, P < .001) and anxiety (FinnGen only, OR = 1.10, CI: 1.01-1.21, P < .05). Likewise, maternal smoking history associated with greater depression (UKB OR = 1.15, CI: 1.10-1.35, P = .027) and anxiety susceptibility (FinnGen OR = 3.02, CI: 1.67-5.46, P = .011). Higher body mass index elevated depression risk in both cohorts. Physical activity showed no clear associations. This MR study provides evidence that education may causally reduce mental health disorder risk. Smoking, obesity, and low activity appear detrimentally linked to depression and anxiety. Improving access to education could offer effective strategies for lowering population psychiatric burden.",Medicine,2024,Humans; Female; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Depression; Educational Status; Anxiety; Middle Aged; Body Mass Index; Smoking; Mental Health; United Kingdom; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Exercise; Genome-Wide Association Study; Risk Factors; Causality,False,0

This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and its metabolic pathways with the risk of intervertebral disk degeneration (IVDD), low back pain (LBP), and sciatica. Genetic variation data for 211 gut microbiota taxa at the phylum to genus level were obtained from the MiBioGen consortium. Genetic variation data for 105 taxa at the species level and 205 metabolic pathways were obtained from the Dutch Microbiome Project. Genetic variation data for disease outcomes were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. The causal relationships between the gut microbiota and its metabolic pathways and the risk of IVDD, LBP, and sciatica were evaluated via Mendelian randomization (MR). The robustness of the results was assessed through sensitivity analysis. Inverse variance weighting identified 46 taxa and 33 metabolic pathways that were causally related to IVDD, LBP, and sciatica. After correction by weighted median and MR-PRESSO, 15 taxa and nine pathways remained stable. After FDR correction, only the effect of the genus_Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group on IVDD remained stable. Sensitivity analyses showed no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy, heterogeneity, or reverse causation. Some microbial taxa and their metabolic pathways are causally related to IVDD, LBP, and sciatica and may serve as potential intervention targets.

However, whether these associations are all causal remains unestablished. This study aimed to assess the potential causal associations of apolipoprotein B and coffee intake with the risk of gastric, colorectal, and esophageal cancers using Mendelian randomization analysis. In this study, we utilized a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to access the causal effects of coffee intake and apolipoprotein B on gastric, colorectal, and esophageal cancers. The summary statistics of coffee intake (n = 428,860) and apolipoprotein B (n = 439,214) were obtained from the UK Biobank. In addition, the summary statistics of gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and esophageal cancer were obtained from the FinnGen biobank (n = 218,792). Inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode were applied to examine the causal relationship between coffee intake, apolipoprotein B and gastric, colorectal, and esophageal cancers. MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran's Q test, and leave-one-out analysis were performed to evaluate possible heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Steiger filtering and bidirectional mendelian randomization analysis were performed to evaluate the possible reverse causality. The result of the inverse variance weighted method indicated that apolipoprotein B levels were significantly associated with a higher risk of gastric cancer (OR = 1.392, 95% CI 1.027-1.889, P = 0.0333) and colorectal cancer (OR = 1.188, 95% CI 1.001-1.411, P = 0.0491). Furthermore, multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis also revealed a positive association between apolipoprotein B levels and colorectal cancer risk, but the effect of apolipoprotein B on gastric cancer risk disappeared after adjustment of coffee intake, body mass index or lipid-related traits. However, we did not discover any conclusive evidence linking coffee intake to gastric, colorectal, or esophageal cancers. This study suggested a causal association between genetically increased apolipoprotein B levels and higher risk of colorectal cancer.

Thus, this study used a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the associations between thyroid function and MS. Bidirectional MR was used to explore the causal relationship between thyroid function (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], free thyroxine [FT4], hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism) and MS. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of thyroid function and MS were obtained from the ThyroidOmics Consortium and the FinnGen Consortium, respectively. Inverse-variance weighted method (IVW) was the primary analysis method to assess causality with Weighted median, MR-Egger regression, weighted mode, and simple mode as auxiliary methods. Sensitivity analyses were performed using heterogeneity tests, horizontal pleiotropy tests and leave-one-out method. There was a positive causal relationship between TSH and MS (IVW: OR = 1.202, 95% CI: 1.040-1.389, P = .013), and no strong evidence was found for an effect of FT4 (IVW: OR = 1.286, 95% CI: 0.990-1.671, P = .059), hypothyroidism (IVW: OR = 1.247, 95% CI: 0.961-1.617, P = .096), and hyperthyroidism (IVW: OR = 0.966, 95% CI: 0.907-1.030, P = .291) on the risk of MS. In the reverse MR results, there was no causal relationship between MS and TSH (IVW: β = -0.009, P = .184), FT4 (IVW: β = -0.011, P = .286), hypothyroidism (IVW: OR = 0.992, 95% CI: 0.944-1.042, P = .745), and hyperthyroidism (IVW: OR = 1.026, 95% CI: 0.943-1.117, P = .549).

We explored the association between the various phenotypes of endometriosis and menstruation, ovulation, reproductive function, and mode of delivery, using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) and summary data on endometriosis stages and locations from the FinnGen consortium and women's menstruation, ovulation, reproductive function, and mode of delivery from OpenGWAS and ReproGen. Inverse-variance weighting was used for the primary MR analysis. In addition, a series of sensitivity analyses, confounding analyses, co-localization analyses, and multivariate MR analyses were performed. MR analysis showed a negative effect of moderate to severe endometriosis on age at last live birth (OR = 0.973, 95% CI: 0.960-0.986) and normal delivery (OR = 0.999, 95% CI: 0.998-1.000; values for endpoint were excluded), ovarian endometriosis on age at last live birth (OR = 0.976, 95% CI: 0.965-0.988) and normal delivery (OR = 0.999, 95% CI: 0.998-1.000; values for endpoint were excluded), and fallopian tubal endometriosis on excessive irregular menstruation (OR = 0.966, 95% CI: 0.942-0.990).

FinnGen,38274231,Association between human blood metabolome and the risk of delirium: a Mendelian Randomization study.,"Delirium significantly contributes to both mortality and morbidity among hospitalized older adults. Furthermore, delirium leads to escalated healthcare expenditures, extended hospital stays, and enduring cognitive deterioration, all of which are acknowledged detrimental outcomes. Nonetheless, the current strategies for predicting and managing delirium remain constrained. Our aim was to employ Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the potential causal relationship between metabolites and delirium, as well as to identify potential therapeutic targets. We identified 129 distinct blood metabolites from three genome-wide association studies (GWASs) conducted on the metabolome, involving a total of 147,827 participants of European descent. Genetic information pertaining to delirium was sourced from the ninth iteration of the Finngen Biobank, encompassing 359,699 individuals of Finnish ancestry. We conducted MR analyses to evaluate the connections between blood metabolites and delirium. Additionally, we extended our analysis to encompass the entire phenome using MR, aiming to uncover potential on-target consequences resulting from metabolite interventions. In our investigation, we discovered three metabolites serving as causal mediators in the context of delirium: clinical low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (odds ratio [OR]: 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-1.73,  (1) Limited representation of the complete blood metabolome, (2) reliance on the PheCode system based on hospital diagnoses may underrepresent conditions with infrequent hospital admissions, and (3) limited to European ancestry. The genetic prediction of heightened O-methylascorbate levels seems to correspond to a diminished risk of delirium, in contrast to the association of elevated clinical LDL-C and sphingomyelin levels with an amplified risk. A comprehensive analysis of side-effect profiles has been undertaken to facilitate the prioritization of drug targets. Notably, O-methylascorbate emerges as a potentially auspicious target for mitigating and treating delirium, offering the advantage of lacking predicted adverse side effects.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023,"Humans; Aged; Cholesterol, LDL; Risk Factors; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Sphingomyelins; Delirium",False,2

In the present study, we investigated the causal relationships between diet-derived circulating antioxidants and 2 non-scarring alopecia using Mendelian randomization (MR). Instrumental variables for antioxidants (lycopene, retinol, ascorbate, β-carotene, α-tocopherol, and γ-tocopherol) were selected from published studies. Data for alopecia areata (AA) and androgenetic alopecia (AGA) was obtained from the FinnGen study project (R9 released in 2023), including 195 cases and 201,019 controls for AGA and 682 cases and 361,140 controls for AA. We used the inverse variance weighted method as the primary MR method. Three additional methods were used as sensitivity analysis to validate the robustness of the results. We found a causal relationship between absolute β-carotene levels and AGA risk (P = .039), but not with AA (P = .283). The results of Wald ratio showed a protective effect of absolute β-carotene levels against AGA, with per 0.1 ln-transformed β-carotene being associated with a 76% lower risk of AGA (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.06-0.93). Based on the fixed effects inverse variance weighting results, we found that α-tocopherol was protective against both AGA (P = .026) and AA (P = .018). For each unit increase in α-tocopherol, the effects of change in AGA and AA were 0.02 (95% CI: 0.00-0.61) and 0.10 (95% CI: 0.01-0.67), respectively.

Emerging evidence implicates immune cells in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, particularly in angiogenesis, tissue proliferation, and lesion invasion. This investigation employs two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) to dissect the bidirectional causal relationships between immune cell profiles and endometriosis. We leveraged publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to elucidate the causal interplay between immune cell traits and endometriosis. Utilizing GWAS summary statistics ranging from accession numbers GCST90001391 to GCST90002121 and endometriosis data from the FinnGen study GWAS (8,288 endometriosis cases and 68,969 controls), we adopted stringent criteria for instrumental variable selection. We applied MR-Egger, weighted median, inverse variance weighted (IVW), and weighted mode methods to derive causal estimates. To address potential heterogeneity and pleiotropy, Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept, and leave-one-out analyses were executed. Reverse-direction MR and bidirectional MR analyses evaluated potential reciprocal causation and the influence of endometriosis on immune cell composition. Our analysis identified five immune phenotypes inversely associated with endometriosis risk. These phenotypes comprise: a percentage of CD11c + HLA-DR + + monocytes, CD25 expression on CD39 + CD4 + T cells, elevated CD25 on CD45RA + CD4 + non-regulatory T cells, HLA-DR intensity on HLA-DR + CD8 bright (CD8br) T cells, and the proportion of naïve double-negative (CD4 - CD8- %DN) T cells. In contrast, eleven phenotypes were positively correlated with endometriosis risk, including: CD127 expression on T cells, the proportion of CD24 + CD27 + B cells within lymphocytes, CD25 expression on CD28 + CD4 + T cells, CD28 expression on CD39 + activated regulatory T cells (activated Tregs), the frequency of bright CD33 HLA-DR + CD14 - cells within the CD33br HLA-DR + compartment, CD45 expression on lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, activation status of central memory CD8 bright (CM CD8br) T cells, CX3CR1 expression on monocytes, and the percentage of HLA-DR + NK cells within the NK cell subset. Sensitivity assessments that excluded significant heterogeneity and pleiotropy confirmed the stability of these associations, thereby reinforcing the validity of our findings. This study provides novel evidence of the potential causal impact of specific immune cells on the risk of developing endometriosis. These findings enhance our understanding of endometriosis pathophysiology and may inform innovative approaches for its diagnosis and management. While our findings provide novel insights, limitations such as potential horizontal pleiotropy and reliance on European ancestry data should be considered.

Genetic contribution to CIDP is unclear and no genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been reported so far. In this study, we aimed to identify CIDP-related risk loci, genes, and pathways. We first focused on CIDP, and 516 CIDP cases and 403,545 controls were included in the GWAS analysis. We also investigated genetic risk for inflammatory polyneuropathy (IP), in which we performed a GWAS study using FinnGen data and combined the results with GWAS from the UK Biobank using a fixed-effect meta-analysis. A total of 1,261 IP cases and 823,730 controls were included in the analysis. Stratified analyses by gender were performed. Mendelian randomization (MR), colocalization, and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) analyses were performed to identify associated genes. Gene-set analyses were conducted to identify associated pathways. We identified one genome-wide significant locus at 20q13.33 for CIDP risk among women, the top variant located at the intron region of gene CDH4. Sex-combined MR, colocalization, and TWAS analyses identified three candidate pathogenic genes for CIDP and five genes for IP.

In this study, we employed Mendelian Randomization (MR) to evaluate the presence of causality and to elucidate the specific causal relationship. We employed six, five, and three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables for relative carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake, identified from a genome-wide association study that included 268,922 individuals of European descent. Furthermore, we acquired summary statistics for genome-wide association studies on AF from the FinnGen consortium, which involved 22,068 cases and 116,926 controls. To evaluate the causal estimates, we utilized the random effect inverse variance weighted method (IVW) and several other MR methods, including MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO, to confirm the robustness of our findings. Our analysis indicates a convincing causal relationship between genetically predicted relative carbohydrate and protein intake and reduced AF risk.

FinnGen,38779749,The impact of neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders on the risk of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"Neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders have been proved that they can comorbid more often with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) than general population. However, the potential causal association between these disorders and iNPH has not been assessed. Thus, our study aims to investigate the causal relationship between them based on a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Random effects of the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method were conducted to obtain the causal association among the neurocognitive disorders, psychiatric disorders, and iNPH. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 12 neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders were downloaded via the OpenGWAS database, GWAS Catalog, and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, whereas GWAS data of iNPH were obtained from the FinnGen consortium round 9 release, with 767 cases and 375,610 controls of European ancestry. We also conducted the sensitivity analysis in these significant causal inferences using weighted median model, Cochrane's Q test, MR-Egger regression, MR Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier detect and the leave-one-out analysis. For most of the neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders, no causal association was established between them and iNPH. We have found that iNPH (odds ratio [OR] = 1.030, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.011-1.048, p = .001) is associated with increased risk for schizophrenia, which failed in validation of sensitivity analysis. Notably, genetically predicted Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with increased risk of iNPH (OR = 1.256, 95% CI: 1.045-1.511, p = .015). Our study has revealed the potential causal effect in which PD associated with an increased risk of iNPH.

FinnGen,39628070,Investigating the Mediating Role of Mental Disorders in the Relationship Between Early Sexual Intercourse and Intentional Self-Harm: A Two-Step and Multivariable Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Epidemiological studies have established an association between early sexual intercourse and intentional self-harm. However, the causal mechanisms, particularly the role of mental health disorders, remain elusive. In this Mendelian randomization (MR) study, we leveraged genome-wide association study data from multiple sources. Age at first sexual intercourse (AFSI) statistics were derived from the UK Biobank, encompassing up to 406,457 participants of European ancestry. Intentional self-harm (ISH) genome-wide association study (GWAS) data were obtained from the FinnGen Biobank, comprising 218,792 European-descent individuals. We investigated the causal relationship between AFSI and ISH and quantified the mediating effects of major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 173,005), schizophrenia (SCZ; n = 127,906), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n = 55,374). Both two-step and multivariable MR approaches were employed to estimate the mediation effects of these psychiatric disorders. The F-statistics of all retained SNPs are over 10, indicating our study has no weak instrument bias. The odds ratio (OR) indicated that early sexual intercourse substantially increases the risk of ISH (IVW: OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.54-0.66, p < 0.05). Specifically, MDD was found to mediate 31% of this effect and SCZ 12%, collectively accounting for 46% of the total effect. Early sexual intercourse is associated with an increased risk of intentional self-harm, potentially mediated by psychiatric disorders. These findings emphasize the need for mental health screening and early intervention in adolescents with early sexual debuts.",Brain and behavior,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Self-Injurious Behavior; Genome-Wide Association Study; Male; Female; Depressive Disorder, Major; Coitus; Schizophrenia; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Adult; Middle Aged; Mental Disorders",False,9
FinnGen,37979213,Exploring the causal relationship between inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory arthritis: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Previous studies have reported an association between inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory arthritis, including Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This study aims to explore the causal relationship between inflammatory cytokines and AS, RA, and PsA using Mendelian randomization (MR). We conducted a bidirectional two-sample MR analysis using genetic summary data from a publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) that included 41 genetic variations of inflammatory cytokines, as well as genetic variant data for AS, RA, and PsA from the FinnGen consortium. The main analysis method used was Inverse variance weighted (IVW) to investigate the causal relationship between exposure and outcome. Additionally, other methods such as MR Egger, weighted median (WM), simple mode, and weighted mode were employed to strengthen the final results. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to ensure the reliability of the findings. The results showed that macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) was associated with an increased risk of AS (OR = 1.163, 95 % CI = 1.016-1.33, p = 0.028). Conversely, high levels of TRAIL and beta nerve growth factor (β-NGF) were associated with a decreased risk of AS (OR = 0.892, 95 % CI = 0.81-0.982, p = 0.002; OR = 0.829, 95 % CI = 0.696-0.988, p = 0.036). Four inflammatory cytokines were found to be associated with an increased risk of PsA: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (OR = 1.161, 95 % CI = 1.057-1.275, p = 0.002); Interleukin 12p70 (IL12p70) (OR = 1.189, 95 % CI = 1.049-1.346, p = 0.007); IL10 (OR = 1.216, 95 % CI = 1.024-1.444, p = 0.026); IL13 (OR = 1.159, 95 % CI = 1.05-1.28, p = 0.004). Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1rα) was associated with an increased risk of seropositive RA (OR = 1.181, 95 % CI = 1.044-1.336, p = 0.008). Similarly, genetic susceptibility to inflammatory arthritis was found to be causally associated with multiple inflammatory cytokines. Lastly, the sensitivity analysis supported the robustness of these findings.

FinnGen,38902823,Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Genes for Hair Growth and Patterning are Associated With Pilonidal Disease.,"Pilonidal sinus disease is a highly morbid condition characterized by the formation of chronic sinus tracts throughout the sacrococcygeal region. Despite its commonality and strong association with family history, no prior investigation of genetic risk factors for pilonidal sinus disease exists. To identify genetic risk factors for pilonidal sinus disease. A genome-wide association study. The United Kingdom Biobank, FinnGen Biobank, and Penn Medicine BioBank. There were 772,072 participants. Genome-wide significant variants ( p < 5 × 10 -8 ) were mapped to genes using physical distance and gene expression in skin. Genetic correlation between pilonidal sinus disease and morphometric, androgen-driven, and hair phenotypes was estimated with linkage disequilibrium score regression. Finally, a genome-first approach to rare predicted deleterious variants in hair shaft genes TCHH , PADI3 , and TGM3 was conducted for association with pilonidal sinus disease via the Penn Medicine BioBank. A genome-wide association study comprising 2835 individuals with pilonidal sinus disease identified 5 genome-wide significant loci, prioritizing HDAC9, TBX15, WARS2, RP11-293M10.1 , PRKAR1B , TWIST1, GPATCH2L, NEK9 , and EIF2B2 , as putative causal genes; several of these genes have known roles in balding and hair patterning. There was a significant correlation between the genetic background of pilonidal sinus disease and the androgen-driven hair traits of male pattern baldness and young age at first facial hair. In a candidate analysis of genes associated with syndromic hair disorders, rare coding variants in TCHH , a monogenic cause of uncombable hair syndrome, were associated with increased prevalence of pilonidal sinus disease (OR 4.81 [95% CI, 2.06-11.2]). This study is limited to European ancestry. However, because there is a higher incidence of pilonidal sinus disease in men of European ancestry, this analysis is focused on the at-risk population. Genetic analysis of pilonidal sinus disease identified shared genetic architecture with hair biology and androgen-driven traits. As the first study investigating the genetic basis of pilonidal sinus disease, this provides biological insight into the long-appreciated connection between the disease state, male sex, and hair.

La correlación genética entre la enfermedad del seno pilonidal y los fenotipos morfométricos, androgénicos y de cabello se estimó con regresión de puntuación LD. Por último, se realizó una aproximación genómica a variantes deletéreas raras predichas en los genes del tallo piloso TCHH, PADI3 y TGM3 para su asociación con la enfermedad del seno pilonidal a través del Biobanco PennMedicine.RESULTADOS:El estudio de asociación de todo el genoma, que incluyó a 2.835 individuos con enfermedad del seno pilonidal, identificó 5 loci significativos en todo el genoma, dando prioridad a HDAC9, TBX15, WARS2, RP11-293M10.1, PRKAR1B, TWIST1, GPATCH2L, NEK9 y EIF2B2, como genes causales putativos; varios de estos genes tienen funciones conocidas en la calvicie y el patrón del cabello. Se observó una correlación significativa entre los antecedentes genéticos de la enfermedad del seno pilonidal y los de los rasgos calvicie de patrón masculino y edad temprana del primer vello facial impulsados por andrógenos. En un análisis de genes candidatos asociados a trastornos capilares sindrómicos, las variantes raras de codificación en TCHH, una causa monogénica del síndrome capilar incombustible, se asociaron a una mayor prevalencia de la enfermedad del seno pilonidal (OR 4,81 [IC del 5%, 2,06-11,2]).LIMITACIONES:Este estudio se limita a la ascendencia europea. Sin embargo, debido a que hay una mayor incidencia de la enfermedad sinusal pilonidal en los hombres de ascendencia europea, este análisis se centra en la población de riesgo.CONCLUSIÓN:El análisis genético de la enfermedad del seno pilonidal identificó una arquitectura genética compartida con la biología del cabello y los rasgos impulsados por andrógenos. Siendo el primer estudio que investiga las bases genéticas de la enfermedad del seno pilonidal, esto proporciona una visión biológica de la conexión, apreciada desde hace tiempo, entre el estado de la enfermedad, el sexo masculino y el cabello.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between daytime napping and CVDs, as well as to validate causality in this relationship by Mendelian randomization (MR). A two-sample MR method was used to evaluate the causal effect of daytime napping on CVDs. The exposure of daytime napping was extracted from publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in the UK Biobank, and the outcomes of 14 CVDs were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. A total of 49 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used as the instrumental variables. The effect estimates were calculated by using the inverse-variance weighted method. The MR analyses showed that genetically predicted daytime napping was associated with an increased risk of five CVDs, including heart failure (odds ratio (OR): 1.71, 95% CI: 1.19-2.44, p = 0.003), hypertension (OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.05-2.16, p = 0.026), atrial fibrillation (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.02-2.88, p = 0.042), cardiac arrythmias (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.01-2.13, p = 0.042) and coronary atherosclerosis (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.17-2.68, p = 0.006).

We aimed to investigate the potential causal relationship between NAFLD and kidney stones using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). Genetic instruments were used as proxies for NAFLD. Summary-level data for the associations of exposure-associated SNPs with kidney stones were obtained from the UK Biobank study (6536 cases and 388,508 controls) and the FinnGen consortium (9713 cases and 366,693 non-cases). MR methods were conducted, including inverse variance weighted method (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO. MR-Egger Regression Intercept and Cochran's Q test were used to assess the directional pleiotropy and heterogeneity. cALT-associated NAFLD did not exhibit an association with kidney stones in the Inverse variance weighted (IVW) methods, in both the FinnGen consortium (OR: 1.02, 95%CI: 0.94-1.11, p = 0.632) and the UKBB study (OR: 1.000, 95%CI: 0.998-1.002, p = 0.852).

FinnGen,39551000,A mendelian randomization study investigating the association between sleep apnea risk and cheese consumption through biomarker analysis.,"Cheese consumption may play a role in mitigating sleep apnea risk, according to our Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Sleep apnea, a prevalent disorder associated with various health complications, affects millions worldwide, generating interest in dietary interventions. This study analyzed data from the UK Biobank and the FinnGen Biobank, focusing on cheese intake and its potential impact on sleep apnea through various biomarkers. Results revealed a significant inverse association between cheese consumption and sleep apnea risk (OR=0.724, p=0.00478), indicating that higher cheese intake is linked to a reduced likelihood of developing the disorder. Additionally, the analysis identified six biomarkers, including aspartate aminotransferase (1.33 %), urea (3.85 %), cystatin C (2.98 %), sex hormone-binding globulin (1.78 %), testosterone (1.94 %), and diastolic blood pressure (5.46 %), as mediators of this relationship. Notably, cheese consumption influenced levels of 23 biomarkers. These findings underscore the potential of dietary interventions in public health strategies aimed at decreasing sleep apnea prevalence and associated health risks.

This study aims to determine the impact of sarcopenia-related muscle traits on depression. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was performed on the summary-level data from the FinnGen cohort to estimate the causal association of appendicular lean mass (ALM), walking pace, or low hand grip strength with depression. Additionally, multivariable MR (MVMR) was performed to assess the dependence of each muscle trait in the causality and adjust the effect of body mass index (BMI). Supplementary backward MR analyses were performed to estimate the effect of depression on sarcopenia-related muscle traits. Univariable MR analyses demonstrated that there were causal associations of ALM (odds ratio [OR]: 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88-0.99), walking pace (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.32-0.88), and low hand grip strength (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.05-1.38) with depression. MVMR analyses showed that ALM was the only trait that had a significant causal relationship with depression (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85-0.98) after accounting for the other two muscle traits. Moreover, the independent association of ALM with depression remained (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85-0.99) after being adjusted by BMI. The backward MR analyses showed no causal associations of depression with any sarcopenia-related muscle traits. Low muscle mass independently increases the risk of depression. This study determined the muscle-related risk factors of depression, which may help establish the causality between sarcopenia and depression and provide evidence-based recommendations for improving mental health in the elderly.",The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,2024,"Aged; Humans; Body Mass Index; Depression; Hand Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Sarcopenia; Mendelian Randomization Analysis",False,8
FinnGen,39118079,Exploring the relationship between gut microbiota and breast cancer risk in European and East Asian populations using Mendelian randomization.,"Several studies have explored the potential link between gut microbiota and breast cancer; nevertheless, the causal relationship between gut microbiota and breast cancer remains unclear. We utilized summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the gut microbiome from the MiBioGen project with summary data from GWAS on breast cancer from the FinnGen consortium and the IEU database, with the IEU data sourced from the Biobank Japan. Preliminary statistical analyses were conducted using inverse variance weighting (IVW), supplemented by various sensitivity analysis methods, including MR-Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, simple median, and simple mode, to ensure the robustness of our findings. Heterogeneity and pleiotropy were assessed to avoid misleading conclusions caused by unconsidered confounders or non-specific effects of genetic variants, ensuring that the results reflect a genuine causal relationship. In European populations, four types of gut microbiota were associated with breast cancer. The genus Erysipelatoclostridium was positively associated with the risk of breast cancer, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.083-1.358), false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.0039. The class Coriobacteriia, order Coriobacteriales, and family Coriobacteriaceae, which belong to the same phylogenetic system, showed a consistent inversely association with breast cancer risk, with an OR of 0.757 (95% CI 0.616-0.930), FDR = 0.0281. In East Asian populations, three types of gut microbiota were related to breast cancer. The Eubacterium ruminantium group was positively associated with breast cancer risk, with an OR of 1.259 (95% CI 1.056-1.499), FDR = 0.0497. The families Porphyromonadaceae and Ruminococcaceae were inversely associated with breast cancer risk, with ORs of 0.304 (95% CI 0.155-0.596), FDR = 0.0005, and 0.674 (95% CI 0.508-0.895), FDR = 0.03173, respectively. However, these two taxa had limited instrumental variables, restricting the statistical power and potentially affecting the interpretation of the results. This MR analysis demonstrated a probable causal link between specific gut microbiota and breast cancer.

This study utilizes Bidirectional Two-Sample and Mediation Mendelian Randomization to explore the causal relationships and mediation effects of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), total testosterone (TT), and estradiol on these associations. We analyzed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with SUA and sex hormone levels using data from large-scale GWAS of European populations. Female infertility data were sourced from 6,481 cases and 75,450 controls in the FinnGen Consortium. We employed methods including Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), Weighted Median, and MR-Egger regression to assess causality. We found that elevated SUA levels causally increase the risk of female infertility (IVW OR: 1.13, P=0.047). Elevated SUA levels significantly decrease SHBG levels (β=-0.261; P=2.177e-04), with SHBG mediating 27.93% of the effect of SUA on infertility (OR=0.854; 95%CI, 0.793-0.920; P=2.853e-05). Additionally, elevated TT levels, which were associated with decreased SUA levels (β=-0.127), showed an indirect effect on infertility mediated by SUA (β=-0.0187; 95% CI, -0.041 to -0.003; P=0.046).

A total of 2,659 participants in the FinnGen biobank project had a schizophrenia diagnosis and clozapine purchases with longitudinal electronic health record follow-up for up to 25 years after clozapine initiation. Diseases and health-related events enriched during clozapine use were identified, adjusting for disease severity. The incidence and recurrence of ADEs over years of clozapine use, their effect on clozapine discontinuation and deaths, and their pharmacogenetics were studied. Median follow-up time after clozapine initiation was 12.7 years. Across 2,157 diseases and health-related events, 27 were enriched during clozapine use, falling into five disease categories: gastrointestinal hypomotility, seizures, pneumonia, other acute respiratory tract infections, and tachycardia, along with a heterogeneous group including neutropenia and type 2 diabetes, among others. Cumulative incidence estimates for ileus (severe gastrointestinal hypomotility) and pneumonia were 5.3% and 29.5%, respectively, 20 years after clozapine initiation. Both events were significantly associated with increased mortality among clozapine users (ileus: odds ratio=4.5; pneumonia: odds ratio=2.8). Decreased genotype-predicted CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 activities were associated with higher pneumonia risk. Clozapine-induced ileus and pneumonia were notably more frequent than has previously been reported and were associated with increased mortality.

Methods: We analyzed the summary statistics of a genome-wide association study summary statistics for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pulmonary embolism (PE), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), lung cancer, sepsis, and sepsis-related mortality. We employed the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method and four additional MR methods. Heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy were assessed using the Cochrane's Q test, MR-Egger intercept, and MR-PRESSO test. A sensitivity analysis was also performed. Results: MR analysis showed associations between COPD and lung cancer with increased sepsis risk (odds ratio (OR)IVW 1.138, P = 0.006; (OR)IVW 1.123, P = 0.031; respectively) and sepsis mortality ((OR)IVW 1.350, P = 0.022; (OR)IVW 1.312, P = 0.022; respectively). Asthma exhibited a potential protective effect against sepsis mortality ((OR)IVW = 0.300, P = 0.039), while PE demonstrated a risk effect ((OR)IVW = 1.148, P = 0.032). No causal association was observed between asthma, PE, and sepsis ( P > 0.05). IPF and OSA were not significantly associated with sepsis or sepsis-related mortality ( P > 0.05). Heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy were not evident for asthma or lung cancer ( P > 0.05). However, horizontal pleiotropy was suggested for COPD by the MR-Egger regression ( P < 0.05), but not by the MR-PRESSO test ( P > 0.05). IPF and OSA were not significantly associated with sepsis or sepsis-related mortality ( P > 0.05). Conclusion: Our MR analysis offers new insights into potential links between noninfectious respiratory diseases and the risk of sepsis. However, additional investigation into the underlying mechanisms and clinical studies are necessary to confirm these findings.","Shock (Augusta, Ga.)",2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Sepsis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Asthma",False,8

But whether gut microbiota promotes or hampers the genesis and development of liver cirrhosis remains vague. This study aimed to establish a causal relationship between gut microbiota and the development of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. To achieve this, we employed a 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis utilizing genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. This approach enabled us to assess the potential impact of gut microbiota on liver cirrhosis. The independent genetic instruments of gut microbiota were obtained from the MiBioGen (up to 18,340 participants), which is a large-scale genome-wide genotype and 16S fecal microbiome dataset. Cirrhosis data were derived from the FinnGen biobank analysis, which included 214,403 individuals of European ancestry (811 patients and 213,592 controls). To assess the causal relationship between gut microbiota and cirrhosis, we applied 4 different methods of MR analysis: the inverse-variance weighted method (IVW), the MR-Egger regression, the weighted median analysis (WME), and the weighted mode. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. Results of MR analyses provided evidence of a causal association between 4 microbiota features and cirrhosis, including 2 family [Lachnosiraceae: odds ratio (OR): 1.82626178; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05208209, 3.17012532; P = 0.0323194; Lactobacillaceae : OR: 0.62897502; 95% CI: 0.42513162, 0.93055788; P = 0.02033345] and 2 genus [Butyricicoccus: OR: 0.41432215; 95% CI: 0.22716865, 0.75566257; P = 0.0040564; Lactobacillus: OR: 0.6663767; 95% CI: 0.45679511, 0.97211616; P = 0.03513627].

Despite these findings, evidence is still lacking to determine whether these metabolites directly promote or prevent BCC's progression. Therefore, our study aims to examine the potential effects of circulating metabolites on BCC progression. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using data from two separate genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The primary study included data for 123 blood metabolites from a GWAS with 25,000 Finnish individuals, while the secondary study had data for 249 blood metabolites from a GWAS with 114,000 UK Biobank participants.GWAS data for BCC were obtained from the UK Biobank for the primary analysis and the FinnGen consortium for the secondary analysis. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy. In the primary analysis, significant causal relationships were found between six metabolic traits and BCC with the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method after multiple testing [P < 4 × 10-4 (0.05/123)]. Four metabolic traits were discovered to be significantly linked with BCC in the secondary analysis, with a significance level of P < 2 × 10-4 (0.05/249). We found that all the significant traits are linked to Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) and their degree of unsaturation.

Thus, we performed a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to identify this association. The prospective cohort studies reporting the relationship between tea consumption and kidney stones were searched from PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science from inception to December 1, 2023. For MR analysis, the summary-level data for tea consumption and kidney stones were extracted from the UK Biobank available data and the 8th release of the FinnGen consortium, respectively. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was the primary analytical method. In our dose-response meta-analysis, four prospective cohort studies involving 1,263,008 participants were included, and tea consumption was found to have significant associations with kidney stones (RR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.73-0.87). We also observed a substantially linear negative relationship between tea consumption and the risk of kidney stones. In MR analysis, the IVW method indicated that tea consumption was inversely associated with kidney stones (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.53-0.94).

This study aims to identify the key proteins and gain insights into SA pathogenesis. We integrated data from the brain proteome (N = 376) and blood proteome (N = 35,559) and combined it with the largest SA GWAS summary statistics to date (N = 518,612). A comprehensive set of methods was employed, including Mendelian randomization (MR), Steiger filtering, Bayesian colocalization, proteome‑wide association studies (PWAS), transcript-levels, cell-type specificity, correlation, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Validation was performed using other protein datasets and the SA dataset from FinnGen study. We identified ten proteins (GLRX5, GMPPB, B3GALTL, FUCA2, TTLL12, ADCK1, MMAA, HIBADH, ACP1, DOC2A) associated with SA in brain proteomics. GLRX5, GMPPB, and FUCA2 showed strong colocalization evidence and were supported by PWAS and transcript-level analysis, and were predominantly expressed in glutamatergic neuronal cells. In blood proteomics, one significant protein (PEAR1) and three near-significant proteins (NDE1, EVA1C, B4GALT2) were identified, but lacked colocalization evidence. Moreover, despite the limited correlation between the same protein in brain and blood, the PPI network analysis provided new insights into the interaction between brain and blood in SA. Furthermore, GLRX5 was associated with the GSTP1, the target of Clozapine. The comprehensive analysis provides strong evidence supporting a causal association between three genetically determined brain proteins (GLRX5, GMPPB, and FUCA2) with SA.

Genetic variants associated with diet-derived circulating antioxidants (retinol, ascorbate, β-carotene, lycopene, α-tocopherol, and γ-tocopherol) were assessed as absolute and metabolic instrumental variables. POAG and glaucoma-related traits data were derived from a large, recently published genome-wide association study database; these traits included intraocular pressure (IOP), macular retinal nerve fiber layer (mRNFL) thickness, macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (mGCIPL) thickness, and vertical cup-to-disc ratio (vCDR). MR analyses were performed per outcome for each exposure. We found no causal association between six diet-derived antioxidants and POAG using the International Glaucoma Genetics Consortium data. For absolute antioxidants, the odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.011 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.854-1.199; P = 0.895) per natural log-transformed β-carotene to 1.052 (95% CI, 0.911-1.215; P = 0.490) for 1 µmol/L of ascorbate. For antioxidant metabolites, the OR ranged from 0.998 (95% CI, 0.801-1.244; P = 0.989) for ascorbate to 1.210 (95% CI, 0.870-1.682; P = 0.257) for γ-tocopherol, using log-transformed levels. A similar result was obtained with the FinnGen Biobank. Furthermore, our results showed no significant genetic association between six diet-derived antioxidants and glaucoma-related traits. Our study did not support a causal association among six diet-derived circulating antioxidants, POAG, and glaucoma-related traits. This suggests that the intake of antioxidants may not have a preventive effect on POAG and offers no protection to retinal nerve cells.

FinnGen,38260127,Controversial causal association between IGF family members and osteoporosis: a Mendelian randomization study between UK and FinnGen biobanks.,"Osteoporosis, a prevalent skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength, is closely linked to the IGF system, crucial for skeletal metabolism. However, the precise nature of this relationship remains elusive. In this study, we employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to unravel the associations between genetically predicted serum IGF system member levels and osteoporosis. A two-sample MR approach was employed to investigate these causal associations based on two individual datasets. Predictions of 14 serum levels of IGF system members were made using 11,036,163 relevant Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within a cohort of 4,301 individuals of European descent. Genetic association estimates for osteoporosis were derived from two publicly available GWAS consortia: the Finnish consortium from the FinnGen biobank, comprising 212,778 individuals of Finnish descent (3,203 cases and 209,575 controls), and the UK consortium from the UK Biobank, including 337,159 individuals of European descent (5,266 cases and 331,893 controls). According to the UK dataset, IGF-1 levels were associated with a reduced risk of osteoporosis, as indicated by the weighted median method (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.998, 95% CI = 0.997-1.000, P = 0.032). Additionally, higher levels of IGFBP-3 were linked to a decreased risk of osteoporosis using the Inverse-Variance Weighted (IVW) method (OR = 0.999, 95% CI = 0.998-1.000, P = 0.019), and CTGF levels exhibited a negative association with osteoporosis, as determined by the weighted median method (OR = 0.998, 95% CI = 0.996-0.999, P = 0.004). In the FinnGen dataset, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were not identified to be associated with osteoporosis. While, IGF-LR1 levels displayed a negative association with osteoporosis, according to the MR-Egger method (OR = 0.886, 95% CI = 0.795-0.987, P = 0.036), while CYR61 was linked to an increased risk of osteoporosis based on both the weighted median and IVW methods (OR = 1.154, 95% CI = 1.009-1.319, P = 0.037, and OR = 1.115, 95% CI = 1.022-1.215, P = 0.014, respectively). This study provides compelling evidence that certain IGF family members play a role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis between different datasets, indicating population specific causal effects between IGF family and osteoporosis. Although the results from both datasets demonstrated that IGF family involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, but the responding key molecules might be various among different population. Subsequent research is warranted to evaluate the potential of these biomarkers as targets for osteoporosis prevention and treatment in specific population.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023,Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Biological Specimen Banks; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Osteoporosis; United Kingdom,False,8

A 2-sample Mendelian randomization study was conducted to ascertain the causal connection between CeD and thyroid dysfunction. Using data from the FinnGen Consortium, a 2-sample Mendelian randomization study was conducted to look at the connection between thyroid dysfunction and CeD. Another replication of the data from the UK Biobank was subsequently performed to confirm our findings. Furthermore, a sequence of sensitivity analyses was performed. The inverse variance weighting technique demonstrates that genetically determined CeD is substantially linked with hypothyroidism, thyrotoxicosis, Graves' disease, and free thyroxine. However, no significant associations were found between CeD and thyroid-stimulating hormone or thyroiditis. Moreover, we achieve the same results in duplicate datasets, which increases the reliability of our findings.

It is crucial to identify novel therapeutic targets based on underlying causes. Here, we aimed to use proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to identify the associations between genetically predicted elevated levels of circulating proteins and distinct HF outcomes, along with specific HF etiologies. Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data for circulating proteins were sourced from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, encompassing 7,213 individuals and profiling 4,657 circulating proteins. Genetic associations for outcomes were obtained from the HERMES Consortium and the FinnGen Consortium. Colocalization analysis was employed to assess the impact of linkage disequilibrium on discovered relationships. For replication, two-sample MR was conducted utilizing independent pQTL data from the deCODE study. Multivariable MR (MVMR) and two-step MR were further conducted to investigate potential mediators. Two proteins (PCSK9 and AIDA) exhibited associations with HF in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), and four proteins (PCSK9, SWAP70, NCF1, and RELT) were related with HF in patients receiving antihypertensive medication. Among these associations, strong evidence from subsequent analyses supported the positive relationship between genetically predicted PCSK9 levels and the risk of HF in the context of CHD. Notably, MVMR analysis revealed that CHD and LDL-C did not exert a complete mediating effect in this relationship. Moreover, two-step MR results yielded valuable insights into the potential mediating proportions of CHD or LDL-C in this relationship. Our findings provide robust evidence supporting the association between PCSK9 and concomitant HF and CHD.

FinnGen,39428439,The mendelian randomized study revealed the association of prostatitis with prostate cancer risk.,"In recent observational studies, a potential link between prostatitis and prostate cancer (PCa) has been hinted at, yet the causality remains ambiguous. In our endeavor to scrutinize the conceivable causal nexus between prostatitis and PCa, we embarked upon a Mendelian randomization (MR) study. MR circumvents arbitrary groupings by employing genetic variations that have a strong association with the exposure as instrumental variables to infer causal relationships between exposures and outcomes. The etiology of PCa remains elusive. Given that prostatitis and prostate cancer occupy the same anatomical region, MR can more effectively delineate their relationship by mitigating confounding variables. This method can indirectly elucidate disease correlations, thereby contributing to cancer prevention strategies. FinnGen Consortium data were used for the prostatitis genome-wide association study (GWAS), including 74,658 participants. UK biobank baseline data (ncase = 3436, ncontrol = 459574), European Bioinformatics Institute Database (ncase = 79148, ncontrol = 61106), and IEU openGWAS database (ncase = 79148, ncontrol = 61106) were used for PCa outcomes, mostly for European population samples. Data from the GWSAs for prostatitis were compared with data from the three GWASs for PCa, respectively, in an analysis of an MR. Utilizing the inverse variance weighting (IVW) methodology as our primary analytical framework, we delved into a meticulous exploration of the conceivable causal association between prostatitis and PCa. Furthermore, we deployed supplementary methodologies, including Maximum Likelihood, MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO, to thoroughly assess and scrutinize the causality aspect comprehensively. Cochran's Q statistic is employed as a metric to quantify the heterogeneity inherent in instrumental variables. The inverse variance weighted analysis revealed no discernible effect of prostatitis on PCa in the three PCa GWAS databases (odds ratio [OR]: 1.001, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.999-1.002, p = 0.28), (OR: 1.015, 95% CI: 0.981-1.050, p = 0.40), (OR: 1.015, 95% CI: 0.981-1.050, p = 0.40). Similarly, employing MR-Egger did not yield substantial evidence (OR: 0.999, 95% CI: 0.999-1.002, p = 0.89), (OR: 1.103, 95% CI: 1.006-1.209, p = 0.07), (OR: 1.103, 95% CI: 1.006-1.209, p = 0.07). The weighted median analysis also failed to provide convincing support for the impact of prostatitis on the incidence of PCa (OR: 1.001, 95% CI: 1.000-1.002, p = 0.064), (OR: 0.989, 95% CI: 0.946-1.034, p = 0.64), (OR: 0.989, 95% CI: 0.945-1.036, p = 0.65).

However, the causal association between iron status, PE, and GH is still not clear. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study using the genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of iron status, included serum iron, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation (TSAT) from the largest available GWAS meta-analysis, and the summary statistics of PE and GH were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. Fixed-effect inverse variance weighted (IVW), random-effect IVW, maximum likelihood (ML), MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO methods were used. A total of 21, 58, 28, and 22 SNPs were used as IVs for serum iron, ferritin, TIBC, and TSAT, respectively. The F-statistics of IVs ranged from 95.23 to 421.36. The results of the fixed effects IVW method suggested that for per SD unit increase in serum iron, the risk of PE increases by 24 % (OR = 1.24, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.50, P = 0.02). No significant heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy was found. The association between ferritin, TIBC, TSAT and PE were statistically insignificant (P>0.05).

However, confounding factors and reverse causality make the causal relationship between gut microbiota and DN uncertain. We aimed to investigate the interactive causal relationships between the abundance of gut microbiota and DN. We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine the causal relationship between gut microbiota and DN. Genomic data on gut microbiota at the genus level were obtained from the MiBioGen Consortium, including 18,340 individuals of European descent. Data on diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) were obtained from the FinnGen Consortium, which included 1,048 cases and 374,434 controls, while data on diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) were also obtained from the FinnGen Consortium, including 111 cases and 374,434 controls. Causal effects were primarily estimated using inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis, supplemented with four validation methods, and additional sensitivity analyses to assess the pleiotropy, heterogeneity, and robustness of instrumental variables. The IVW analysis indicated that  Our study identified a causal relationship between gut microbiota and the increased or decreased risk of diabetic neuropathy.

However, the specific causal relationships underlying these associations remain unclear. This study utilized summary statistics of GM from the MiBioGen consortium, along with an unprecedented dataset comprising 1091 blood metabolites and 309 metabolite ratios from the UK Biobank, in conjunction with OC data from the FinnGen Consortium R9 release. We conducted bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to investigate the causal relationships between GM and OC. Additionally, a two-step MR approach was employed to identify potential mediating metabolites. Our analysis revealed significant associations between 6 specific microbiota taxa and OC. Furthermore, we identified several plasma metabolites that act as mediators of the association between GM and OC. In the two-step MR analysis, we observed a negative correlation between 4-methoxyphenol sulfate and pregnenetriol disulfate levels with OC. The genus Lachnospiraceae UCG008 potentially increases the risk of OC by decreasing 4-methoxyphenol sulfate levels, while the genus Howardella may elevate the risk of OC by reducing pregnenetriol disulfate levels, with mediation proportions of 22.35% and 4.23%, respectively. Additionally, levels of dilinoleoyl-GPE (18:2/18:2) and N-acetylkynurenine (2) were positively correlated with OC. The inhibitory effect of the genus Ruminococcus 1 on OC may be mediated through 1,2-dilinoleoyl-GPE (18:2/18:2) and N-acetylkynurenine (2), with mediation proportions of 10.15% and 11.32%, respectively.

FinnGen,38283337,Two-sample Mendelian randomization to study the causal association between gut microbiota and atherosclerosis.,"According to some recent observational studies, the gut microbiota influences atherosclerosis via the gut microbiota-artery axis. However, the causal role of the gut microbiota in atherosclerosis remains unclear. Therefore, we used a Mendelian randomization (MR) strategy to try to dissect this causative link. The biggest known genome-wide association study (GWAS) (n = 13,266) from the MiBioGen collaboration was used to provide summary data on the gut microbiota for a two-sample MR research. Data on atherosclerosis were obtained from publicly available GWAS data from the FinnGen consortium, including cerebral atherosclerosis (104 cases and 218,688 controls), coronary atherosclerosis (23,363 cases and 187,840 controls), and peripheral atherosclerosis (6631 cases and 162,201 controls). The causal link between gut microbiota and atherosclerosis was investigated using inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode approaches, among which inverse variance weighting was the main research method. Cochran's Q statistic was used to quantify the heterogeneity of instrumental variables (IVs), and the MR Egger intercept test was used to assess the pleiotropy of IVs. Inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) estimation showed that  We discovered that the presence of probiotics and pathogens in the host is causally associated with atherosclerosis, and atherosclerosis at different sites is causally linked to specific gut microbiota. The specific gut microbiota associated with atherosclerosis identified by Mendelian randomization studies provides precise clinical targets for the treatment of atherosclerosis.

FinnGen,39568808,Evaluating the causal effects between Grave's disease and diabetes mellitus: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"Graves' disease (GD) is an autoimmune disease associated with an increased incidence of other autoimmune diseases. To investigate the causality between GD and Diabetes mellitus (DM), we designed bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) and multivariable MR (MVMR) studies. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with GD, thyroid peroxidase (TPO), thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), type 1 diabetes (T1D), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) were obtained from the IEU Open GWAS and FinnGen biobank databases. For the forward MR study, we used GD (sample size = 458,620) as the exposure and T1D (sample size = 520,580) and T2D (sample size = 211,766) as the outcomes. Next, high risk of T1D and T2D were used as exposure variables, and GD was used as the outcome variable for the reverse MR analysis. Finally, MVMR analysis was conducted to investigate the probable relationship between DM and indicators for thyroid function like TPO, Tg, and TSH. The inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the main method. Finally, the heterogeneity and sensitivity were assessed. There were 27, 88, and 55 SNPs associated with GD, T1D, and T2D, respectively. A significant causal connection between higher genetic liability of GD and the risk of T2D (OR [95% CI] = 1.059 [1.025-1.095], P = 5.53e-04) was found in the forward MR analysis. Comparatively, the significant causal relationship between higher genetic liability of GD and the risk of T1D was not demonstrated (OR [95% CI] = 0.998[0.927,1.074], P=0.949). However, reverse MR suggested that there was a genetic susceptibility to T1D that increased the likelihood of developing GD (OR [95% CI] = 1.173[1.117,1.231], P = 1.913e-10), while T2D did not (OR [95% CI] = 0.963 [0.870-1.066],  There was no increased risk of T1D with an increase in genetic susceptibility to GD, although higher genetic susceptibility to T1D has been shown to be associated with increased risk of developing GD.

Traits of circulating lipids have been related to the onset and progression of endometriosis in previous observational studies but the results have remained contradictory. We performed univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using instrument variables to genetically predict the associations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and B from the UK Biobank with endometriosis (consisting of 8288 cases and 68 969 controls from the FinnGen consortium). The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary estimate, whereas MR-Egger and weighted median were conducted as complements to the IVW model. Increased levels of triglycerides were associated with higher risk of endometriosis and endometriosis of the pelvic peritoneum in the univariable MR analyses. In multivariable MR analysis including apoB, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in the same model, triglycerides still retained a robust effect. Decreased levels of apoA-I and HDL cholesterol were associated with increased risk of endometriosis and endometriosis of the pelvic peritoneum in univariable MR analyses. After mutual adjustment, HDL cholesterol retained a robust effect whereas the association for apoA-I was attenuated. This is the first MR-based evidence to suggest that triglycerides and HDL cholesterol are the predominant traits that account for the aetiological relationship of lipoprotein lipids with risk of endometriosis, in particular endometriosis of the pelvic peritoneum.

To comprehensively investigate the causal effects of telomere length throughout the human disease spectrum, we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization study (MR-PheWAS) and a systematic review of MR studies. We conducted a PheWAS to screen for associations between telomere length and 1 035 phenotypes in the UK Biobank (n = 408 354). The exposure of interest was the genetic risk score (GRS) of telomere length. Observed associations passing multiple testing corrections were assessed for causality by 2-sample MR analysis. A systematic review of MR studies on telomere length was performed to harmonize the published evidence and complement our findings. Of the 1 035 phenotypes tested, PheWAS identified 29 and 78 associations of telomere length GRS at a Bonferroni- and false discovery rate-corrected threshold; 24 and 66 distinct health outcomes were causal in the following principal MR analysis. The replication MR using data from the FinnGen study provided evidence of causal effects of genetically instrumented telomere length on 28 out of 66 outcomes, including decreased risks of 5 diseases in respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, and myocardial infarction, and increased risks of 23 diseases, mainly comprised neoplasms, diseases of the genitourinary system, and essential hypertension. A systematic review of 53 MR studies found evidence to support 16 out of the 66 outcomes. This large-scale MR-PheWAS identified a wide range of health outcomes that were possibly affected by telomere length, and suggested that susceptibility to telomere length may vary across disease categories.","The journals of gerontology.

FinnGen,38499600,Unveiling potential drug targets for hyperparathyroidism through genetic insights via Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses.,"Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) manifests as a complex condition with a substantial disease burden. While advances have been made in surgical interventions and non-surgical pharmacotherapy for the management of hyperparathyroidism, radical options to halt underlying disease progression remain lacking. Identifying putative genetic drivers and exploring novel drug targets that can impede HPT progression remain critical unmet needs. A Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to uncover putative therapeutic targets implicated in hyperparathyroidism pathology. Cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) data serving as genetic instrumental variables were obtained from the eQTLGen Consortium and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal. Hyperparathyroidism summary statistics for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations were sourced from the FinnGen study (5590 cases; 361,988 controls). Colocalization analysis was performed to determine the probability of shared causal variants underlying SNP-hyperparathyroidism and SNP-eQTL links. Five drug targets (CMKLR1, FSTL1, IGSF11, PIK3C3 and SLC40A1) showed significant causation with hyperparathyroidism in both eQTLGen and GTEx cohorts by MR analysis. Specifically, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK3C3) and solute carrier family 40 member 1 (SLC40A1) showed strong evidence of colocalization with HPT. Multivariable MR and Phenome-Wide Association Study analyses indicated these two targets were not associated with other traits. Additionally, drug prediction analysis implies the potential of these two targets for future clinical applications. This study identifies PIK3C3 and SLC40A1 as potential genetically proxied druggable genes and promising therapeutic targets for hyperparathyroidism. Targeting PIK3C3 and SLC40A1 may offer effective novel pharmacotherapies for impeding hyperparathyroidism progression and reducing disease risk. These findings provide preliminary genetic insight into underlying drivers amenable to therapeutic manipulation, though further investigation is imperative to validate translational potential from preclinical models through clinical applications.",Scientific reports,2024,Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Quantitative Trait Loci; Class III Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Cost of Illness; Hyperparathyroidism; Genome-Wide Association Study; Follistatin-Related Proteins,False,8

We used a two-sample, two-step MR to determine:1) the causal effect of BT levels on AD; 2) the causal effect of two lipid metabolites, obesity and LDLc on AD; and 3) the mediating effects of these metabolites. Pooled data for BT levels and lipid metabolism were obtained from the UK Biobank. AD data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Project International Genomics Consortium, FinnGen Consortium, and UK Biobank study. Effect estimates from external genome-wide association study (GWAS) pooled statistics were obtained using inverse variance-weighted (IVW) MR analysis. Higher levels of BT were associated with a reduced risk of AD (odds ratio [OR] 0.9992, 95% CI 0.9985-0.9998, P = 0.019), and there was a negative correlation with LDLc (OR 0.9208, 95% CI 0.8569-0.9895, P = 0.024) and obesity class 2 (OC2) (OR 0.7445, 95% CI 0.5873-0.9437, P = 0.014).

Traditional epidemiological and cell biology studies, have identified correlations between blood traits and cancer risks. These findings are important as they suggest potential risk factors and biological mechanisms. However, these studies often can't confirm causality, pointing to the need for further investigation to understand these relationships better. Mendelian randomization (MR), utilizing single-nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables, was employed to investigate blood cell trait causal effects on cancer risk. Thirty-six blood cell traits were analyzed, and their impact on 28 major cancer outcomes was assessed using data from the FinnGen cohort, with eight major cancer outcomes and 22 cancer subsets. Furthermore, 1,008 MR analyses were conducted, incorporating sensitivity analyses (weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO) to address potential pleiotropy and heterogeneity. The analysis (data from 173,480 individuals primarily of European descent) revealed significant results. An increase in eosinophil count was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal malignancies (OR = 0.7702 per 1 SD higher level, 95% CI = 0.6852 to 0.8658; P = 1.22E-05).

For each increase in the standard deviation of triglyceride levels, there was a 12.0% increase in the risk of IBS rather than that of FD. Low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein A, and apolipoprotein B levels were not associated with the risk of IBS or FD. Through this study, we identified the causal role of triglycerides in the pathogenesis of IBS, which could benefit further basic and clinical research.",Scientific reports,2024,Humans; Irritable Bowel Syndrome; Dyspepsia; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Apolipoproteins; Cholesterol; Lipids,False,8
FinnGen,37605959,The relationship between sex hormone-binding protein and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease using Mendelian randomisation.,"The incidence of non-alcohol fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing annually with the improvement of living standards. Numerous epidemiological observations have linked sex hormone-binding protein (SHBG) levels to NAFLD. However, evidence of the causal role of SHBG in the development and progression of NAFLD is still absent. Therefore, a systematic assessment of the causal relationship is needed. A two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis was conducted. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for SHBG were obtained online from the IEU database (ebi-a-GCST90012111) as exposure. GWAS data from the NAFLD of the Finngen consortium were used for preliminary analysis, while NAFLD data from another GWAS involving 8434 participants were used for replication and meta-analyses. Causal effects were investigated with inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median and MR-Egger regression. Sensitivity analyses including Cochran's Q test, leave-one-out analysis and MR-Egger intercept analysis were simultaneously conducted to assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy. After rigorous selection, 179 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified as strongly correlated instrumental variables. Preliminary analysis suggested a significant causal relationship between genetically determined serum SHBG levels and NAFLD [odds ratio (OR)  The genetic tendency to high levels of SHBG was causally correlated with a reduced risk of NAFLD, indicating that circulating high levels of SHBG was a protective factor for NAFLD.",European journal of clinical investigation,2024,"Humans; Blood Proteins; Databases, Factual; Genome-Wide Association Study; Gonadal Steroid Hormones; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease",False,8
FinnGen,38310246,Bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis identifies causal associations between cardiovascular diseases and frozen shoulder.,"Although prior observational studies indicate an association between cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and frozen shoulder (FS), the potential causal relationship between them remains uncertain. This study aims to explore the genetic causal relationship between CVDs and FS using Mendelian randomization (MR). Genetic variations closely associated with FS were obtained from the FinnGen Consortium. Summary data for CVD, including atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and ischemic stroke (IS), were sourced from several large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). MR analysis was performed using inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR Egger, and weighted median methods. IVW, as the primary MR analysis method, complemented by other sensitivity analyses, was utilized to validate the robustness of the results. Further reverse MR analysis was conducted to explore the presence of reverse causal relationships. In the forward MR analysis, genetically determined risk of stroke and IS was positively associated with FS (OR [95% CI] = 1.58 (1.23-2.03), P < 0.01; OR [95% CI] = 1.46 (1.16-1.85), P < 0.01, respectively). There was no strong evidence of an effect of genetically predicted other CVDs on FS risk. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. In the reverse MR analysis, no causal relationships were observed between FS and various CVDs. The study suggests that stroke increases the risk of developing FS.

FinnGen,38878456,Associations between genetically predicted TIMP-3 levels and risk of venous thromboembolism: A two sample Mendelian randomization study.,"TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 (TIMP-3) may contribute to the pathogenesis of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, few studies have investigated the effect of TIMP-3 on VTE. Therefore, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to investigate the association between TIMP-3 levels and VTE. Seven independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for TIMP-3 levels were obtained from a published genome-wide association study (the KORA Consortium, including 997 Europeans). We obtained outcome datasets for VTE, pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from the FinnGen Consortium. The primary analytical method used in the MR analysis was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method. To enhance the robustness of the MR results, some other MR methods including weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO were conducted. Moreover, several sensitivity analyses were performed to identify potential horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity. In primary IVW MR analyses, per log increase in genetically predicted TIMP-3 levels were positively associated with the incidence of VTE (odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.01, 1.06; P = 0.010), PE (OR, 1.04; 95 % CI, 1.01, 1.08; P = 0.009), and DVT (OR, 1.06; 95 % CI, 1.02, 1.10; P= 0.003). The results of the weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO were similar to the main findings. No unbalanced pleiotropy or heterogeneity was observed. The study suggests that genetically predicted high levels of TIMP-3 may be associated with an increased risk of VTE. These findings indicate that strategies targeting TIMP-3 may provide a basis for the prevention and treatment of VTE. Further investigation is required to clarify this potential mechanism.",Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Venous Thromboembolism; Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Pulmonary Embolism; Risk Factors; Venous Thrombosis",False,2
FinnGen,39432624,Causal association between hypothyroidism and obstructive sleep apnea: A bidirectional 2-sample Mendelian Randomization study.,"Although previous epidemiological studies have investigated the correlation between hypothyroidism and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the results are controversial and conflicting. Therefore, we used a bidirectional 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to infer the causal relationship between hypothyroidism and OSA. We performed a bidirectional 2-sample MR analysis to infer the causal relationship between hypothyroidism and OSA using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. The hypothyroidism dataset was obtained from GWAS of the IEU database (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/). The GWAS dataset associated with OSA was obtained from the FinnGen Biobank (https://www.finngen.fi/en). MR results were estimated using the inverse variance weighted, weighted median, MR-Egger, simple mode, and weighted mode methods. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and leave-one-out tests. Scatter plots, forest plots, funnel plots, and leave-one-out plots were used as visualizations of MR results. According to the inverse variance weighted method, forward MR analysis showed that hypothyroidism was significantly associated with OSA (odds ratio, 1.870 [95% confidence interval, 1.055-3.315]; P = .032). There was no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between OSA and the risk of hypothyroidism in reverse MR analysis (P = .881). Furthermore, sensitivity analysis further confirmed the robust results. Our bidirectional 2-sample MR analysis revealed that hypothyroidism could increase the risk of developing OSA but did not provide evidence to support a causal relationship of OSA on hypothyroidism. Thus, patients with hypothyroidism should strengthen their sleep quality monitoring, and further research is needed to understand the role of hypothyroidism effects on OSA.",Medicine,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Hypothyroidism; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Genome-Wide Association Study",False,8

Further, the immune cell changes mediating the impact of GM on BI are not completely understood. We made use of the summary statistics of 211 GM (MiBioGen consortium), 731 immune cells, and 2 different BIs (FinnGen consortium), namely traumatic BI (TBI) and focal BI (FBI), from the extensive genome-wide association studies to date. We executed bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to ascertain the causal relationships between the GM and BI, and 2-step MR to validate possible mediating immune cells. Additionally, thorough sensitivity analyses verified the heterogeneity, robustness, as well as horizontal pleiotropy of the results. Based on the results of inverse-variance weighted (IVW) and sensitivity analyses, in MR analyses, 5 specific GM taxa and 6 specific GM taxa were causally associated with FBI and TBI, respectively; 27 immunophenotypes and 39 immunophenotypes were causally associated with FBI and TBI, respectively. Remarkably, Anaerofilum, LachnospiraceaeNC2004group, RuminococcaceaeUCG004, CCR2 on myeloid dendritic cell (DC), CD123 on CD62L+ plasmacytoid DC, and CD123 on plasmacytoid DC were causally associated with TBI and FBI (all P < .040). However, our reverse MR did not indicate any influence of TBI and FBI on the specific GM. In mediation analysis, we found that the associations between Escherichia.Shigella and FBI were mediated by CD123 on CD62L + plasmacytoid DC in addition to CD123 on plasmacytoid DC, each accounting for 4.21% and 4.21%; the association between FamilyXIIIAD3011group and TBI was mediated by CCR2 on myeloid DC, with mediated proportions of 5.07%. No remarkable horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity of instrumental variables was detected. Our comprehensive MR analysis first provides insight into potential causal links between several specific GM taxa with FBI/TBI. Additionally, CD123 on plasmacytoid DC in conjunction with CCR2 on myeloid DC may function in gut microbiota-host crosstalk in FBI and TBI, correspondingly.

GWAS data for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) was extracted from the FinnGen consortium, comprising 179 cases and 218 613 controls. Genetic variation data for 211 gut microbiota were obtained as instrumental variables from MiBioGen. Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to determine the causal relationship between the two, with inverse variance weighting (IVW) being the primary method for causal analysis. The MR results were validated through several sensitivity analyses. The study identified a protective effect against SCLC for the genus Eubacterium ruminantium group (OR = 0.413, 95% CI: 0.223-0.767, p = 0.00513), genus Barnesiella (OR = 0.208, 95% CI: 0.0640-0.678, p = 0.00919), family Lachnospiraceae (OR = 0.319, 95% CI: 0.107-0.948, p = 0.03979), and genus Butyricimonas (OR = 0.376, 95% CI: 0.144-0.984, p = 0.04634).

FinnGen,39316794,Assessing the causal association of sleep abnormalities with preeclampsia and eclampsia: a Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Preeclampsia and eclampsia are severe pregnancy disorders marked by hypertension and potential organ damage. The etiological basis of preeclampsia and eclampsia is not fully understood. Previous studies have revealed a link between sleep abnormality and preeclampsia/eclampsia, but the causal relationship remains unclear. In this study, we explored the genetic links between sleep and preeclampsia/eclampsia using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. RNA sequence dataset GSE114691 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, comprising placental tissues from patients with preeclampsia and controls. Differential expression analysis was conducted with R (v4.2.3) and DESeq2 (v1.38.3). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was carried out using HTSanalyzeR2. GWAS summary data on preeclampsia/eclampsia and genetic markers for sleep abnormality were sourced from the FinnGen Consortium and IEU genetic databases. The Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted with TwoSampleMR (v0.6.2), and the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach was employed as the principal method. GSEA analysis revealed that the orexin receptor pathway showed heightened expression in the preeclampsia group versus controls. The random-effects IVW results showed that sleeplessness/insomnia has a genetic causal relationship with preeclampsia (OR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.07-4.06,  This study provides significant evidence for a genetic causal association between sleep abnormalities and preeclampsia/eclampsia.

In this study, we conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets. We initially analyzed depression data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and the UK Biobank (n = 500,199), alongside COPD data from the FinnGen Consortium (n = 329,552). The second phase involved comparing depression data from FinnGen (n = 372,472) with COPD data from the UK Biobank (n = 361,194). Our Mendelian analysis employs various methods to guarantee a comprehensive and rigorous investigation. In the initial analytic phase utilizing the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, COPD does not significantly contribute to the incidence of depression (IVW odds ratio (OR) = 0.989, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.895 to 1.092, P = 0.824). Conversely, the data suggested a statistically significant association where depression may precipitate the development of COPD, with a notable increase in risk (IVW OR = 1.421, 95 % CI = 1.149 to 1.756, P = 0.001). Subsequent validation through a second-step analysis reinforced the hypothesis that depression elevates the likelihood of COPD onset (IVW OR = 1.002, 95 % CI = 1.0003 to 1.0046, P = 0.028). Our study, utilizing Mendelian randomization analysis, determined that COPD does not escalate the risk of depression. Conversely, our analysis suggests that depression may elevate the risk of developing COPD.

The primary objective of this study was to elucidate the causal interplay between cholecystitis and augmented risk of sudden cardiac death. We used large-scale genetic summary data from genome-wide association study, genetic summary statistics were sourced from 3 eminent repositories: the UK Biobank (N = 463,010), the FinnGen consortium (N = 215,027), and the European Bioinformatics Institute (N = 471,251). By employing 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to decipher the causal interplay between cholecystitis and sudden death etiologies, a meta-analytical approach was employed to amalgamate the findings derived from these disparate data sources. The primary MR methodologies used included inverse variance weighting with random effects, inverse variance weighting with fixed effects, maximum likelihood, MR-Egger, and weighted median. Subsequently, we performed heterogeneity testing, polyvalency examination, and sensitivity analysis to bolster the robustness of causal relationship assessments. Meta-analysis and amalgamating variegated data sources revealed a statistically significant inverse correlation between cholecystitis and ventricular arrhythmias (odds ratio, 0.896; 95% confidence interval: 0.826-0.971; P = .008). Similarly, an inverse association was observed between cholecystitis and aortic aneurysm (odds ratio, 0.899; 95% confidence interval: 0.851-0.951, P < .001). This study substantiates the absence of a direct causal link between cholecystitis and cerebrovascular accidents (P = .771), pulmonary embolism (P = .071), and acute myocardial infarction (P = .388).

Our study aims to delineate the bidirectional relationship between plasma metabolites and GC and find potential metabolic pathways. We undertook a bidirectional 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationship, specificity, and direction of association between 1400 plasma metabolites and GC. The GWAS data for metabolites was obtained from a cohort of 8299 European individuals. And the GC's GWAS data was from FinnGen Consortium with 2384 European individuals, and the GWAS catalog with 1029 European ancestry cases for validation. Causal estimates were primarily calculated by the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method. To ensure robustness, we performed comprehensive sensitivity analyses to assess heterogeneity and address concerns regarding horizontal pleiotropy. We validated the forward relationship between metabolites and GC from another database and implemented meta-analysis. Furthermore, we conducted metabolic enrichment and pathway analysis of these causal metabolites using MetaboAnalyst5.0/6.0 with the database of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. All statistical analysis was carried out using R software. Metabolites like 2s, 3R-dihydroxybutyrate, 4-acetamidobutanoate, ferulic acid 4-sulfate and methyl indole-3-acetate was proven positively linked with the development of GC. Asparagine, glucose to maltose ratio, glycohyocholate, Gulonate levels, linoleoyl ethanolamide and Spermidine to (N(1) + N(8))-acetylspermidine ratio was proven to be negatively associated with GC. Moreover, linoleic acid, histidine, glutamine, bilirubin, Succinate to proline ratio were found to be potentially linked to the development of GC. Furthermore, our analysis identified 18 significant metabolic pathways, including Arginine and proline metabolism (P < .009) and Valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis (P < .031).

In this study, we performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess the associations of genetically determined liver fat, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and body mass index (BMI) with the risk of PLC. The summary statistics of exposures were obtained from two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) based on the UK Biobank (UKB) imaging cohort and the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. GWAS summary statistics for PLC were obtained from FinnGen consortium R7 release data, including 304 PLC cases and 218 488 controls. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) was used as the primary analysis, and a series of sensitivity analyses were performed to further verify the robustness of these findings. IVW analysis highlighted a significant association of genetically determined liver fat (OR per SD increase: 7.14; 95% CI: 5.10-9.99; P = 2.35E-30) and VAT (OR per SD increase: 5.70; 95% CI: 1.32-24.72; P = .020) with PLC but not of BMI with PLC. The findings were further confirmed by a series of MR methods. No evidence of horizontal pleiotropy between these associations existed.

FinnGen,38863045,Genetic Causal Associations between Various Serum Minerals and Risk of Depression: A Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Previous observational studies have discovered a connection between depression and mineral status. Confirming this potential connection is challenging due to confounding factors and potential reverse causality which is inherent in observational studies. We performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to estimate the causal association of serum minerals with depression. Leveraging summary-level data on depression, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was applied. The data on serum minerals were collected from the FinnGen Biobank database. MR assessments representing causality were produced by inverse-variance weighted approaches with multiplicative random and fixed effects. Sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the reliability of the results. A noteworthy correlation emerged between serum zinc levels and reduced risk of depression. An odds ratio (OR) of 0.917 for depression associated with a one standard deviation increase in serum zinc levels (OR = 0.968; 95% CI = 0.953-0.984, p = 1.19 × 10-4, random effects model inverse variance weighted (IVW)); (OR = 0.928; 95% CI = 0.634-1.358, p = 0.766, MR Egger). Sensitivity assessments supported this causation. However, the risk of depression did not exhibit an association with other minerals.

FinnGen,38728465,Gene association analysis to determine the causal relationship between immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and frozen shoulder.,"Multiple studies have indicated a potential correlation between immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) and Frozen shoulder (FS). To explore the genetic causal relationship between IMIDs and FS using 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data for FS were obtained from Green's study, while data for 10 IMIDs were sourced from the FinnGen Consortium. The MR analysis was performed using inverse variance weighting, MR Egger, and weighted median methods. IVW, as the primary MR analysis technique, was complemented with other sensitivity analyses to validate the robustness of the results. Additionally, reverse MR analysis was further conducted to investigate the presence of reverse causal relationships. In the forward MR analysis, genetically determined 4 IMIDs are causally associated with FS: rheumatoid arthritis (odds ratio [OR] (95% confidence interval [95% CI]) = 1.05 [1.02-1.09], P < .01); type 1 diabetes (OR [95% CI] = 1.06 [1.03-1.09], P < .01); hypothyroidism (OR [95% CI] = 1.07 [1.01-1.14], P = .02); and Celiac disease (OR [95% CI] = 1.02 [1.01-1.04], P = .01). However, no causal relationship was found between 6 IMIDs (autoimmune hyperthyroidism, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, sicca syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus) and FS. Sensitivity analyses did not detect any heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy. In the reverse MR analysis, no causal relationship was observed between FS and IMIDs.

FinnGen,37951389,Causal Association between Tea Intake and Acute Cerebrovascular Events: A Multivariate Mendelian Randomized Study in European Populations.,"Numerous research works have investigated the association between tea consumption and the risk of acute cerebrovascular events; however, the results are inconsistent. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the causal association between tea intake and several acute cerebrovascular events, including any ischemic stroke, large atherosclerotic stroke (LAS), cardiogenic embolic stroke (CES), small vessel stroke (SVS), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We obtained summary genome-wide association study (GWAS) data on tea intake and acute cerebrovascular events in populations of European ancestry. The GWAS on tea intake is derived from the UK Biobank, where we have chosen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) closely associated with it as instrumental variables. We also obtained summary data on ischemic stroke from a GWAS meta-analysis, as well as summary data on ICH and SAH from the FinnGen study. We first explored the causal association between tea intake and several acute cerebrovascular events using univariate Mendelian randomization (UVMR), and then further assessed the causal association between tea intake and SVS using multivariate Mendelian randomization (MVMR) corrected for multiple confounders. In UVMR, genetically predicted increases in tea intake were linked to a lower risk of SVS (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.86). There was no causal association between tea intake and the risk of other acute cerebrovascular events. In the MVMR, our results show that there was still a significant causal association between drinking tea and SVS, after adjusting body mass index, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and alcohol consumption. This MR study provides new genetic evidence that increased tea intake reduces the risk of SVS in the European population. However, possibly because of limited statistical power, the study did not find that tea consumption reduced the risk of several other acute cerebrovascular events.",The Journal of nutrition,2024,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Ischemic Stroke; Stroke; Cholesterol, LDL; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Tea; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",False,7
FinnGen,37612215,Investigation of the causal relationship between Interleukin-6 signaling and gastrointestinal tract cancers: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies indicate that interleukin-6(IL-6) has been associated with gastrointestinal tract cancers. However, the causal association is still confusing. Thus, we aimed to putative the causality between IL-6 signaling and gastrointestinal tract cancers. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to assess the causal effects. Two groups of IL-6 signaling-related single nucleotide polymorphisms were chosen from two Genome-wide association studies. Summary-level data for gastrointestinal tract cancers including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancer, were obtained from the FinnGen consortium and UK Biobank study. We also performed survival analysis to explore the prognostic value of IL-6 in gastrointestinal tract cancers. Genetically predicted plasma sIL6R level, which inhibits IL-6 Signaling, was associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer in FinnGen. In the combined analysis of the two sources, genetically predicted sIL6R was associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer (OR = 0.943, 95%CI: 0.904,0.983, p = 0.006). Survival analysis results indicated the prognostic value of IL-6 in gastric cancer. These results present evidence indicating that genetically-determined reduced IL-6 signaling lowers the risk of gastric cancer, which may provide potential prevention and therapeutic strategies for gastric cancer. Additionally, IL-6 may be a prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer.",Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,2024,"Humans; Stomach Neoplasms; Interleukin-6; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8

The inverse-variance weighted method, along with Cochran's Q test, Mendelian randomization-Egger regression, Mendelian randomization-PRESSO global test, and the leave-one-out approach, were applied to infer causality and assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Findings indicate hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with structural brain alterations, including reduced cortical thickness in areas like the insula, isthmus cingulate gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, temporal pole, and transverse temporal gyrus, and an increased surface area in the superior frontal gyrus. Specific associations were found for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy subtypes: chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia increased cortical thickness in the supramarginal gyrus; preeclampsia/eclampsia led to thinner cortex in the lingual gyrus and larger hippocampal volume and superior parietal lobule surface area. Chronic hypertension was associated with reduced cortical thickness in the caudal and rostral anterior cingulate and increased surface area of the cuneus and thickness of the pars orbitalis cortex. Gestational hypertension showed no significant brain region changes. These insights clarify hypertensive disorders of pregnancies' neurological and cognitive effects by identifying affected brain regions.","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2024,"Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Brain; Genome-Wide Association Study; Magnetic Resonance Imaging",False,3

However, it is unclear whether a cause-effect relationship exists between them. We aimed to examine the casual effect of IBD on the risk of HSP and ITP. Based on summary statistics from International IBD Genetics (IIBDG) Consortium and FinnGen study, a two-sample Mendelian randomization study was carried out to determine whether IBD including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) is causally related to HSP, ITP or secondary thrombocytopenia. To support the results, a variety of sensitivity analyses were performed. Significant causal relationships between IBD and HSP (odds ratios = 1.20, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.36, adjusted P = 0.006) and ITP (odds ratios =1.22, 95% confidence interval: 1.08-1.38, adjusted P = 0.006) were found. Both genetically predicted UC and CD were positively related with ITP, while CD alone may be responsible for the higher risk of HSP. Besides, no significant association was observed between IBD and secondary thrombocytopenia. The results of this Mendelian randomization study supported the causal association of IBD with HSP and ITP.

FinnGen,37807832,The effect of metformin on urate metabolism: Findings from observational and Mendelian randomization analyses.,"To evaluate the effect of metformin on urate metabolism. Using the UK Biobank, we first performed association analyses of metformin use with urate levels, risk of hyperuricaemia and incident gout in patients with diabetes. To explore the causal effect of metformin on urate and gout, we identified genetic variants proxying the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)-lowering effect of metformin targets and conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) utilizing the urate and gout genetic summary-level data from the CKDGen (n = 288 649) and the FinnGen cohort. We conducted two-step MR to explore the mediation effect of body mass index and systolic blood pressure. We also performed non-linear MR in the UK Biobank (n = 414 055) to show the results across HbA1c levels. In 18 776 patients with type 2 diabetes in UK Biobank, metformin use was associated with decreased urate [β = -4.3 μmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.0, -1.7, p = .001] and reduced hyperuricaemia risk (odds ratio = 0.87, 95% CI 0.79, 0.96, p = .004), but not gout. Genetically proxied averaged HbA1c-lowering effects of metformin targets, equivalent to a 0.62% reduction in HbA1c, was associated with reduced urate (β = -12.5 μmol/L, 95% CI -21.4, -4.2, p = .004). Body mass index significantly mediated this association (proportion mediated = 33.0%, p = .002). Non-linear MR results suggest a linear trend of the effect of metformin on urate reduction across various HbA1c levels. The effect of metformin may reduce urate levels but not incident gout in the general population.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2024,"Humans; Uric Acid; Hyperuricemia; Metformin; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Glycated Hemoglobin; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Gout; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8

However, it is unknown whether the role of NRG4 in lipid homeostasis is causal to atherosclerosis and whether the effect is beneficial across different atherosclerosis subtypes. We investigated the causal role of the levels of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides regulated by NRG4 in subtypes of atherosclerosis through two sample Mendelian randomization. Aggregated genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data for serum lipid level of 1.32 million individuals with European ancestry were obtained from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium. GWAS summary data for four atherosclerosis subtypes (peripheral, coronary, cerebral and the other atherosclerosis) were obtained from FinnGen Consortium. Generalized inverse-variance-weighted Mendelian randomization and several sensitivity analyses were used to obtain the causal estimates. A 1-SD genetically elevated LDL-C level mediated by NRG4 was validated to be nominally associated with the risk of peripheral atherosclerosis (log (odds ratio)= 4.14, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 8.17, P = 0.04), and the other associations were not significant or could not be validated by sensitivity analyses.

FinnGen,39054435,The genetic effects of hormones modulated by the Pituitary-Thyroid/Adrenal/Gonadal axis on the risk of developing venous thromboembolism: a mendelian randomization study.,"The aim of this study was to explore the genetic effects of hormones modulated through the pituitary-thyroid/adrenal/gonadal axis on the risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) and to investigate the potentially causal relationships between them. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design was used. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) used as instrumental variables for various hormones and hormone-mediated diseases were derived from published genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Summary statistics for the risk of developing VTE (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism [PE]) were obtained from the UK Biobank and the FinnGen consortium. Inverse-variance weighting (IVW) was applied as the primary method to analyse causal associations. Other MR methods were used for supplementary estimates and sensitivity analysis. A genetic predisposition to greater free thyroxine (FT4) concentrations was associated with a greater risk of developing DVT (OR = 1.0007, 95%CI [1.0001-1.0013], p = 0.0174) and VTE (OR = 1.0008, 95%CI [1.0002-1.0013], p = 0.0123). Genetically predicted hyperthyroidism was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing DVT (OR = 1.0685, 95%CI [1.0139-1.1261], p = 0.0134) and VTE (OR = 1.0740, 95%CI [1.0165-1.1348], p = 0.0110). According to the initial MR analysis, testosterone concentrations were positively associated with the risk of developing VTE (OR = 1.0038, 95%CI [1.004-1.0072], p = 0.0285). After sex stratification, estradiol concentrations were positively associated with the risk of developing DVT (OR = 1.0143, 95%CI [1.0020-1.0267], p = 0.0226) and VTE (OR = 1.0156, 95%CI [1.0029-1.0285], p = 0.0158) in females, while the significant relationship between testosterone and VTE did not persist. SHBG rs858518 was identified as the only SNP that was associated with an increased risk of developing VTE, mediated by estradiol, in females. Genetically predicted hyperthyroidism and increased FT4 concentrations were positively associated with the risk of developing VTE. The effects of genetically predicted sex hormones on the risk of developing VTE differed between males and females.

However, whether these factors contribute to polyps remains unclear. This study aims to use Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationship between gut microbiota and 4 types of polyps (nasal, gallbladder, colon, and gastric polyps), as well as to analyze the mediating role of immune traits. This study utilized large-scale GWAS meta-analyses of gut microbiota (MiBioGen Consortium), 731 immune traits, and 4 types of polyps (one from the FinnGen Consortium and three from the NBDC Human Database). Univariate MR with the inverse variance weighted (IVW) estimation method was employed as the primary analytical approach. A two-step MR analysis was performed to identify potential mediating immune traits. Additionally, multivariable MR approach based on Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) was employed to further prioritize gut microbiota and immune traits associated with polyp development. Based on IVW method in univariate MR analysis, we identified 39 gut microbial taxa and 135 immune traits significantly causally associated with at least one type of polyp. For nasal polyps, 13 microbial taxa and 61 immune traits were causally associated. After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, CD3 on Central Memory CD8 Our findings shed light on the causal relationships between gut microbiota, immune traits, and polyp development, underscoring the crucial roles of gut microbiota and immune status in polypogenesis.

In this study, we utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationship between immune cell traits and endometriosis for the first time. Seven hundred and thirty-one immune cell signatures associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were extracted from a published genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 472 174 individuals, while endometriosis data, including four stages and seven subtypes, were obtained from the FinnGen consortium.

FinnGen,37788476,Assessing Causality Between Second-Hand Smoking and Potentially Associated Diseases in Multiple Systems: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study.,"The global disease burden may be exacerbated by exposure to passive smoking (SHS), with the workplace being a primary location for such exposure. Numerous epidemiological studies have identified SHS as a risk factor for diseases affecting various systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, immune, endocrine, and nervous systems. The conventional observational study has certain methodological constraints that can be circumvented through a Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Our MR study intends to investigate the causal link between workplace exposure to SHS and the potential associated diseases. Summary statistics data involving European participants were sourced from three databases: the UK Biobank, the FinnGen study, and the European Bioinformatics Institute. Genetic variants linked with exposure to SHS in the workplace were identified as instrumental variables. The MR was carried out using inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median methods. Sensitivity tests were also undertaken within the MR to evaluate the validity of the causality. According to the IVW model, genetically determined atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke (p = 6.64E-04 and 5.68E-07, odds ratio = 2.030 and 2.494, 95% confidence interval = 1.350 to 3.051 and 1.743 to 3.569) were robustly associated with exposure to SHS in the workplace. Suggestive associations were found between workplace SHS and myocardial infarction (MI), asthma, and depression. The MR study demonstrates that exposure to SHS in the workplace is a significant risk factor for AF and stroke in European individuals. Whether workplace exposure to SHS influences other diseases and the causality between them requires further exploration. This study explored the causality between exposure to SHS in the workplace and potential associated diseases in multiple systems, including MI, AF, stroke, lung cancer, asthma, allergic disease, type 2 diabetes, and depression, using an MR study. The MR study can circumvent the methodological constraints of observational studies and establish a causal relationship. The two-sample MR analysis provides evidence supporting the causal association of frequent workplace SHS with AF and stroke. Individuals exposed to SHS in the workplace may also have a heightened risk of MI, asthma, and depression. However, whether SHS affects other diseases and the causality between them requires further investigation. To our knowledge, this is the first two-sample MR study to determine the causal relationship between SHS and potential diseases. Exposure to SHS in the workplace is a prevalent issue and may contribute to a global disease burden.

Nevertheless, due to the influence of the inflammatory microenvironment, the causal relationship between specific inflammatory mediators and the development of IDD remains uncertain. The understanding of the causal relationship between inflammatory mediators and IDD is of great importance in preventing and delaying disc degeneration in the future. We utilized genetic data concerning systemic circulating inflammatory regulators obtained from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) analyzing 41 serum cytokines in a cohort of 8293 individuals from Finland. The genetic data for IDD were derived from the most recent GWAS summary statistics conducted within the FinnGen consortium, encompassing 37,636 IDD cases and 270,964 controls. Our analysis employed bidirectional 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) techniques, which included several MR methods such as MR Egger, weighted median, inverse variance weighted, weighted mode, and simple mode. Additionally, the MR-PRESSO method was employed to identify horizontal pleiotropy, heterogeneity was quantified using the Cochran Q statistic, and MR-Egger intercept analysis was performed to assess pleiotropy. We established causal relationships between 3 specific inflammatory factors and IDD. Elevated levels of MIP-1β (OR = 0.956, 95% CI: -0.08 to -0.006; P = .02) and IFN-G (OR = 0.915, 95% CI: -0.16 to -0.02; P = .01) expression were associated with a reduced risk of IDD. Conversely, genetic susceptibility to IDD was linked to a decrease in IL-13 levels (OR = 0.967, 95% CI: -0.063 to -0.004; P = .03).

Many HBCs are diagnosed in the late stage, which increases the disease burden, indicating that effective prevention strategies and identification of risk factors are urgent. Many studies have reported the role of thyroid hormones on HBC. Our research aims to assess the causal effects and investigate the mediation effects between thyroid function and HBC. Utilizing the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, the study employs single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables (IVs) to explore causal links between thyroid function [free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism] and HBC. Data were sourced from the ThyroidOmic consortium and FinnGen consortium. The analysis included univariable and multivariable MR analysis, followed by mediation analysis. The study found a significant causal association between high FT4 levels and the reduced risk of BTC, but not HCC. However, TSH, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism had no causal associations with the risk of HBC. Notably, we also demonstrated that only higher FT4 levels with the reference range (FT4-RR) could reduce the risk of BTC because this protective effect no longer existed under the conditions of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Finally, we found that the protective effect of FT4-RR on BTC was mediated partially by decreasing the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and reducing the waist circumference (WC). The findings suggest that higher FT4-RR may have a protective effect against BTC, which is partially mediated by decreased risk of MetS and a reduction in WC. This study highlights the potential role of FT4 in the pathogenesis of BTC and underscores that MetS and WC may play mediation effects as two mediators in this process.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Biliary Tract Neoplasms; Thyroxine; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Mediation Analysis; Risk Factors; Hypothyroidism; Female; Male; Hyperthyroidism; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular",False,0

However, the credibility of these associations could be influenced by various confounding factors. Consequently, our study sought to employ a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to elucidate a potential causal relationship between psycho-emotional disorders and GERD. Information on independent genetic variants linked to mood swings, highly strung, and anxious feelings was gathered from European populations participating in the IEU Open GWAS research. The FinnGen Consortium provided the genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for GERD. Our analysis employed the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method under the random effects model as the main analytical method. To further bolster our findings, we employed the weighted median and MR Egger methods. In addition, we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses. Our study supports the existence of a causal relationship between psycho-emotional disorders and GERD. Mood swings, highly strung, and anxious feelings adversely affected GERD risk (mood swings: OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.19-5.59, p = 3.09 × 10-2; highly strung: OR 5.63, 95% CI 1.77-17.94, p = 3.42 × 10-3; anxious feelings: OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.08-4.33, p = 2.89 × 10-2).

It is an incurable condition, and most treatments are aimed at alleviating symptoms. This study aimed to investigate the impact of statins on osteoarthritis by using a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach, using genetic variants associated with statin use as instrumental variables. Information on single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with statin medication was obtained from the FinnGen study, and data on osteoarthritis were sourced from the UK Biobank. The inverse variance weighted method was used as the primary analytical approach for the Mendelian randomization analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity. To examine the genetic relationship between statins and osteoarthritis, linkage disequilibrium score regression-based estimates were used. Mendelian randomization analysis indicated a positive effect of statin use on the treatment of osteoarthritis (odds ratio 0.951, 95% confidence interval 0.914-0.99, p < 0.05). This conclusion was supported by various Mendelian randomization methods. Sensitivity analyses revealed no significant directional pleiotropy or influential single nucleotide polymorphisms that could compromise the overall causal inference. Linkage disequilibrium score regression-based estimates suggested a modest genetic correlation between statin use and osteoarthritis (Rg = 0.098, Se = 0.034, p < 0.05), thus reinforcing the robustness of the Mendelian randomization analysis.

FinnGen,38551043,Mendelian Randomization Highlights Gut Microbiota of Short-chain Fatty Acids' Producer as Protective Factor of Cerebrovascular Disease.,"Recent research advancements have indicated a potential association between gut microbiota and cerebrovascular diseases, although the precise causative pathways and the directionality of this association remain to be fully elucidated. This study utilized a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) methodology to explore the causal impact of gut microbiota compositions on the risk of cerebrovascular disease. Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) data pertaining to gut microbiota were obtained from the MiBioGen consortium. For Ischemic Stroke (IS), Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), Vascular Dementia (VD), and Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH), GWAS summary data were sourced from the FinnGen consortium, the IEU Open GWAS project, and the GWAS catalog, respectively. Our MR analyses identified that specific bacterial strains, notably those involved in the production of Short-chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), including Barnesiella, Ruminococcus torques group, and Coprobacter, serve as protective factors against IS, TIA, and SAH. Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) analysis corroborated a significant genetic correlation between these gut microbiota strains and various forms of cerebrovascular disease. In contrast, reverse MR analysis failed to establish a bidirectional causal relationship between genetically inferred gut microbiota profiles and these cerebrovascular conditions. This investigation has pinpointed particular strains of gut microbiota that play protective or detrimental roles in cerebrovascular disease pathogenesis. These findings offer valuable insights that could be pivotal for the clinical management, prevention, and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases.",Current neurovascular research,2024,"Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Protective Factors; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,6

A Mendelian randomization study.,"In recent years, epidemiological studies have revealed the relationship between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this study, we utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the potential causal impact of GDM on cardiovascular disease for the first time.  We retrieved summary statistics from published genome-wide association studies. MR was first performed using significant SNPs extracted from the eighth data release of the FinnGen study. Next, a replication analysis for coronary artery disease (CAD) was conducted in another European ancestry population to validate our findings. Finally, mediation analysis was carried out to assess potential mediation effects. Our data analysis revealed that genetically predicted GDM was significantly associated with increased CAD risk (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18, p 0.006). Replication analysis confirmed a significant genetic association between GDM and CAD (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12, p 0.003) in another European ancestry population. Mediation analysis indicated no significant mediation effect by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on the GDM-CAD relationship (mediation effect β [95% CI]: 0.005 [-0.003, -0.017]). Women with a prior history of GDM face an elevated risk of future CAD. This increased risk of CAD cannot be solely attributed to the subsequent onset of diabetes.

FinnGen,39110727,Fast and scalable ensemble learning method for versatile polygenic risk prediction.,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) enhance population risk stratification and advance personalized medicine, but existing methods face several limitations, encompassing issues related to computational burden, predictive accuracy, and adaptability to a wide range of genetic architectures. To address these issues, we propose Aggregated L0Learn using Summary-level data (ALL-Sum), a fast and scalable ensemble learning method for computing PRS using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). ALL-Sum leverages a L0L2 penalized regression and ensemble learning across tuning parameters to flexibly model traits with diverse genetic architectures. In extensive large-scale simulations across a wide range of polygenicity and GWAS sample sizes, ALL-Sum consistently outperformed popular alternative methods in terms of prediction accuracy, runtime, and memory usage by 10%, 20-fold, and threefold, respectively, and demonstrated robustness to diverse genetic architectures. We validated the performance of ALL-Sum in real data analysis of 11 complex traits using GWAS summary statistics from nine data sources, including the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium, Breast Cancer Association Consortium, and FinnGen Biobank, with validation in the UK Biobank. Our results show that on average, ALL-Sum obtained PRS with 25% higher accuracy on average, with 15 times faster computation and half the memory than the current state-of-the-art methods, and had robust performance across a wide range of traits and diseases. Furthermore, our method demonstrates stable prediction when using linkage disequilibrium computed from different data sources.

FinnGen,38191483,Associations of fatty acids with the risk of biliary tract calculus and inflammation: a Mendelian randomization study.,"The presence of gallstones in both the gallbladder and bile ducts is referred to as cholelithiasis. The prevalence of cholecystolithiasis and bile duct stones differs. Observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have elucidated the significant contributing role of numerous fatty acids (FAs) in the development of cholelithiasis. Despite numerous studies about cholelithiasis, evidence on the relationship between serum FA levels and cholecystolithiasis, as well as bile duct stones with or without inflammation, remains insufficient. A two-sample MR study was designed to clarify the impact of serum FA levels on various bile duct inflammatory diseases. The summary statistics of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with fatty acids were obtained from the UK Biobank (UKB) and included data from 114,999 participants. The researchers obtained GWAS summary statistics for cholecystolithiasis and bile duct stones in 463,010 and 361,194 European participants, including cases with and without inflammation. No sample overlap between the exposure and outcome was verified through the ""mr-lap"" package. The SNPs were screened to identify instrumental variables (IVs). Cochran's Q test was applied for heterogeneity assessment. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) (fixed effects or random effects), MR-Egger regression and weighted median methods were used for MR. Multivariable MR was applied to determine the direct effect of each exposure on the outcome. A false discovery rate (FDR) was applied to adjust for multiple testing correction based on the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Finally, the FinnGen Consortium was used to validate some results. The overall concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the serum was negatively associated with the risk of calculus of the gallbladder with acute cholecystitis (IVW, OR = 0.996, P = 0.038, CI 0.992-0.999; weighted median, OR = 0.995, P = 0.025, CI 0.991-0.999). The percentage of PUFAs to total monounsaturated fatty acids(MUFAs) (IVW, OR = 0.998, P = 0.045, CI 0.997-0.999) and the percentage of PUFAs to total FAs (IVW, OR = 0.997, P = 0.025, CI 0.995-0.999) had a protective role against cholecystitis. The percentage of PUFAs to total FAs had a protective role against calculus of the gallbladder without cholecystitis (IVW, OR = 0.995, P = 0.026, CI 0.990-0.999; MR Egger, OR = 0.99, P = 0.03, CI 0.982-0.998; weighted median, OR = 0.991, P = 5.41e-06, CI 0.988-0.995). Conversely, the percentage of MUFAs to total FAs increased the risk for cholecystitis (IVW, OR = 1.001, P = 0.034, CI 1.0001-1.002). However, there were no causal effects of the above exposures on the outcomes through multivariable MR and multiple testing correction. Finally, the causal effects of the above exposures on cholecystitis were validated in the FinnGen Consortium, which suggested that the percentage of PUFAs to total FAs (IVW, OR = 0.744, P = 0.021, CI 0.579-0.957) had a protective role against cholecystitis. These Mendelian randomization findings suggested that more attention should be focused on people who have low serum PUFA levels, which may have a potential role in the occurrence of calculus of the gallbladder or cholecystitis rather than calculus of the bile duct without cholangitis or cholecystitis.",Lipids in health and disease,2024,Humans; Gallstones; Fatty Acids; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Biliary Tract; Inflammation; Cholecystitis,False,8
FinnGen,39720899,Relation of 91 Circulating Inflammatory Proteins to Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomisation Study.,"Increasingly, emerging research evidence has demonstrated that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a disease closely associated with systemic inflammation. However, the specific upstream inflammatory factors engaged in the pathogenesis of NAFLD remain unclear. Our study aimed to identify the inflammatory regulators causally associated with NAFLD pathogenesis through Mendelian randomisation. A two-sample Mendelian randomisation method was applied to analyse the causal association between 91 circulating inflammatory proteins and NAFLD. Data on circulating inflammatory proteins were derived from samples of European ancestry (14,824 samples) and NAFLD data were obtained from the FinnGen consortium (2025 cases and 284,826 controls). Instrumental variables were selected from the genetic variance and F-statistics were calculated to avoid bias. We adopted the random-effects inverse variance weighting (IVW) method as our primary analytical approach. Supplementary analyses were also implemented, including weighted median, MR-Egger and weighted mode. Moreover, we conducted pleiotropy and heterogeneity analyses to validate the accuracy of the findings. The application of Mendelian randomisation analysis identified four inflammatory factors that might be causally associated with NAFLD at the genetic level. Elevated levels of eotaxin (or = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.05-1.53, p = 0.014), osteoprotegerin (OPG) (or = 1.29, 1.03-1.60, p = 0.023) and TNFRSF9 (or = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.06-1.64, p = 0.014) may be causally related to an increasing risk of NAFLD. Conversely, heightened leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) levels (or = 0.63, 0.44-0.92, p = 0.016) were linked to a lower risk of NAFLD onset. There was no causal relationship between levels of other circulating inflammatory proteins and NAFLD. Our analysis uncovered four upstream inflammatory factors genetically associated with the pathogenesis of NAFLD. These results highlight the potential involvement of inflammation in NAFLD, which provides partial insights for further research in this field in the future.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2024,"Humans; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Inflammation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Biomarkers",False,8
FinnGen,38194289,Mechanisms of thyrotropin receptor-mediated phenotype variability deciphered by gene mutations and M453T-knockin model.,"The clinical spectrum of thyrotropin receptor-mediated (TSHR-mediated) diseases varies from loss-of-function mutations causing congenital hypothyroidism to constitutively active mutations (CAMs) leading to nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism (NAH). Variation at the TSHR locus has also been associated with altered lipid and bone metabolism and autoimmune thyroid diseases. However, the extrathyroidal roles of TSHR and the mechanisms underlying phenotypic variability among TSHR-mediated diseases remain unclear. Here we identified and characterized TSHR variants and factors involved in phenotypic variability in different patient cohorts, the FinnGen database, and a mouse model. TSHR CAMs were found in all 16 patients with NAH, with 1 CAM in an unexpected location in the extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain (p.S237N) and another in the transmembrane domain (p.I640V) in 2 families with distinct hyperthyroid phenotypes. In addition, screening of the FinnGen database revealed rare functional variants as well as distinct common noncoding TSHR SNPs significantly associated with thyroid phenotypes, but there was no other significant association between TSHR variants and more than 2,000 nonthyroid disease endpoints. Finally, our TSHR M453T-knockin model revealed that the phenotype was dependent on the mutation's signaling properties and was ameliorated by increased iodine intake. In summary, our data show that TSHR-mediated disease risk can be modified by variants at the TSHR locus both inside and outside the coding region as well as by altered TSHR-signaling and dietary iodine, supporting the need for personalized treatment strategies.",JCI insight,2024,"Animals; Humans; Mice; Hyperthyroidism; Iodine; Mutation; Phenotype; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; Receptors, Thyrotropin",False,8

This two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study utilized summary level data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Gut microbiota GWAS data were obtained from the MiBio-Gen consortium meta-analysis (n=13,266), while osteoporosis summary statistics were sourced from the FinnGen consortium R9 release data (7300 cases and 358,014 controls). Metabolite data, including 1400 metabolites or metabolite ratios, were derived from a study involving 8,299 unrelated individuals. The primary MR method employed was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method. Reverse MR analysis was conducted on bacteria causally associated with osteoporosis in forward MR. The gut microbiota with the smallest p-value was selected as the top influencing factor for subsequent mediation analysis. A two-step MR approach quantified the proportion of the blood metabolite effect on gut microbiota influencing osteoporosis. IVW and Egger methods were used to assess heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. IVW estimates indicated a suggestive effect of family Christensenellaceae on osteoporosis (odds ratio(OR) = 1.292, 95% confidence interval(CI): 1.110-1.503, P =9.198 × 10-4). Reverse MR analysis revealed no significant causal effect of osteoporosis on family Christensenellaceae (OR = 0.947, 95% CI: 0.836-1.072, P =0.386). The proportion of the effect of family Christensenellaceae on osteoporosis mediated by circulating levels of 3,4-dihydroxybutyrate was 9.727%. No significant heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy was detected in the instrumental variables used for MR analysis.

Despite the existence of several off-label treatment options that have shown clinical effectiveness in managing HG symptoms, the variability in treatment response highlights the need for more effective therapies. Our study aims to identify novel therapeutic targets that could lead to the development of additional, more effective treatment options. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to estimate the causal effects of blood-druggable genes on HG. Summary statistics for HG were obtained from the FinnGen study and UK Biobank. Cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) for blood druggable genes were obtained from the eQTLGen Consortium and used as genetic instrumental variables. Another MR method, summary level mendelian randomization (SMR), was used to further confirm our results. We also used eQTL data of other vomiting-related tissues, brain regions, and esophagus, to validate our MR results. Finally, the potential side effects of the druggable genes for HG treatment were assessed using a phenome-wide MR. Overall, 2499 unique druggable genes were gathered. Two blood drug targets (OVGP1 and LGALS1) showed significant MR results in two independent datasets. No significant heterogeneity of instrumental variables or pleiotropy was detected. In addition, SMR analysis further confirmed the significance of these two prior druggable genes in the brain and esophagus tissues. Further phenome-wide MR analysis revealed no association between genetic proxies of OVGP1, and LGALS1 has been detected in increasing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and other common diseases.

To mitigate confounding factors and establish the causal relationship between sepsis and osteoporosis, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using publicly available summary statistics. Methods: Utilizing summary data from FinnGen Biobank, we employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to predict the causal relationship between osteoporosis and sepsis. The MR analysis primarily utilized the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, supplemented by MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode analyses, with Bayesian weighted MR (BWMR) analysis employed for result validation. Sensitivity analyses included MR-PRESSO, ""leave-one-out"" analysis, MR-Egger regression, and Cochran Q test. Results: In the European population, an increase of one standard deviation in osteoporosis was associated with an 11% increased risk of sepsis, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.11 (95% CI, 1.06-1.16; P = 3.75E-06). BWMR yielded an OR of 1.11 (95% CI, 1.06-1.67; P = 1.21E-05), suggesting osteoporosis as a risk factor for sepsis. Conversely, an increase of one standard deviation in sepsis was associated with a 26% increased risk of osteoporosis, with an OR of 1.26 (95% CI, 1.11-1.16; P = 0.45E-03). BWMR yielded an OR of 1.26 (95% CI, 1.09-1.45; P = 1.45E-03), supporting sepsis as a risk factor for osteoporosis. Conclusion: There is an association between osteoporosis and sepsis, with osteoporosis serving as a risk factor for the development of sepsis, while sepsis may also promote the progression of osteoporosis.","Shock (Augusta, Ga.)",2024,Humans; Sepsis; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Osteoporosis; Risk Factors,False,8

In addition, the final results were reinforced by the methods of MR Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode. The sensitivity analyses were used to validate the robustness of results and ensure the absence of heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. MR-Steiger was used to assess whether the causal direction was correct to avoid reverse causality.

FinnGen,39362746,Genetic variants associated with cardiac hypertrophy-related sudden cardiac death and cardiovascular outcomes in a Finnish population.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common cause of non-ischaemic sudden cardiac death (SCD). Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) without cardiomyopathy-related myocardial disarray is a common autopsy finding and is often associated with prior hypertension in SCD subjects. Our aim was to investigate novel rare gene variants among SCD subjects with presumably hypertension-related LVH and myocardial fibrosis at autopsy. Whole exome sequencing was used to study rare variants (minor allele frequency<0.005) estimated to be deleterious in 96 non-ischaemic SCD subjects with presumably hypertension-related LVH and myocardial fibrosis. Associations of the identified variants with cardiac disease endpoints were replicated in the Finnish national genetic study (FinnGen) dataset. 18 variants were estimated likely to affect protein function and 14 of these were associated with cardiomyopathies, heart failure, conduction abnormalities, hypertension and/or cardiac arrest in Finnish population (FinnGen). Three of the variants were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. These include the splice site variant NM_000449.3:c.234-1G>A in regulatory factor X5 and frameshift variants NM_000449.3:c.234-1G>A in dehydrogenase/reductase 7C and NM_015873.3:c.1164del in villin like.

Genetic variants associated with RA (12,555 cases and 240,862 controls), miscarriage (1475 cases and 149,622 controls), and IUGR (3558 cases and 207,312 controls) were obtained from the FinnGen consortium, and supplementary data on RA (5201 cases and 457,732 controls) and miscarriage (7069 cases and 250,492 controls) were obtained from the Medical Research Council Integrated Epidemiology Unit (MRC-IEU). 47 Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with RA were screened as instrumental variables (IV). The causal relationship between RA and pregnancy loss and IUGR were assessed by 5 MR methods, mainly inverse variance weighting (IVW). Sensitivity analyses were also performed to test the stability of the results. Bidirectional MR showed that genetically predicted RA was causally associated with pregnancy loss and IUGR in forward MR analyses, and that RA significantly increased pregnancy loss [odds ratio (OR) = 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.33, P = .03] and IUGR (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01-1.15, P = .019). In the reverse MR, there was no causal association between pregnancy loss (P = .15) and IUGR (P = .87) and RA. This study found a significant genetic association between RA and pregnancy loss and IUGR. RA is considered to be a high-risk factor for adverse maternal outcomes.

FinnGen,39303836,Landscape of stroke comorbidities: A disease-wide association study.,"Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with diverse comorbidities that influence its clinical outcomes. However, a comprehensive understanding of the short- and long-term patterns of stroke-related comorbidities remains limited. To address this gap, we conducted a disease-wide association study (DWAS) to systematically explore the landscape of stroke comorbidities in a population-based cohort. Using data from the FinnGen cohort, which included 337,194 participants and 27,496 ischemic stroke cases, we analyzed 1,757 medical events as potential stroke comorbidities. We employed Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for sex and age, to identify significant associations between stroke and these medical events. Comorbidities were classified into pre- and post-stroke categories, and their temporal patterns were analyzed over a 1- to 15-year follow-up period. Our findings revealed that stroke comorbidities span multiple disease taxonomies, with significant enrichment in the circulatory, digestive, and musculoskeletal systems. Notably, the study identified distinct pre-stroke and post-stroke comorbidities that persist or evolve over time, supporting the concept of a disease continuum. These temporal patterns suggest that stroke risk and outcomes are shaped by sequential comorbidities rather than simultaneous occurrences. This study provides the most comprehensive profile of stroke comorbidities to date, highlighting the interconnected nature of diseases. By mapping the progression of comorbidities across time and disease categories, DWAS offers valuable insights for early intervention and long-term treatment. Our findings emphasize the importance of viewing stroke as part of a broader disease continuum, offering new opportunities for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies tailored to individual risk profiles.",Progress in cardiovascular diseases,2024,"Humans; Male; Female; Comorbidity; Aged; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Risk Assessment; Time Factors; Stroke; Ischemic Stroke; Prognosis; Aged, 80 and over",False,0
FinnGen,37840448,Associations of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cirrhosis with liver cancer in European and East Asian populations: A Mendelian randomization study.,"The positive relationships of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cirrhosis with liver cancer were shown in previous observational studies, while further Mendelian randomization (MR) investigations are needed to confirm the possible causal associations. This study aimed to explore whether NAFLD and cirrhosis were causally related to liver cancer using MR in European and East Asian populations. For European populations, NAFLD data were obtained from a genome-wide meta-analysis (8434 patients and 770 180 controls). The data on chronic elevation of alanine aminotransferase (cALT), a proxy of NAFLD, were derived from Million Veteran Program (68 725 patients and 95 472 controls). Cirrhosis data were collected from two sources: a genome-wide association study of five cohorts (4829 patients and 72 705 controls) and FinnGen (1931 patients and 216 861 controls). Liver cancer data were collected from FinnGen (304 patients and 174 006 controls). For East Asian populations, the data on cirrhosis (2184 patients and 210 269 controls) and hepatocellular carcinoma (1866 patients and 195 745 controls) were obtained from Biobank Japan. Three, 41, seven, six, and three single-nucleotide polymorphisms were used for NAFLD (European), cALT (European), cirrhosis (European-five cohorts), cirrhosis (European-FinnGen), and cirrhosis (East Asian), respectively. We used inverse-variance weighted as the primary method to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Among European populations, genetically-predicted NAFLD, cALT, cirrhosis (five cohorts), and cirrhosis (FinnGen) were positively associated with liver cancer, with ORs (95% CIs) of 6.62 (3.81-11.50) (p < .001), 2.59 (1.70-3.94) (p < .001), 3.38 (2.41-4.75) (p < .001), and 2.62 (1.20-5.72) (p = .015). Among East Asian populations, there was also a positive association between genetically-predicted cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.78-2.52; p < .001). This study utilized MR to complementarily confirm the positive connections of NAFLD and cirrhosis with liver cancer, as identified in earlier observational research.

However, consistent conclusions have not been reached due to various limitations. In order to determine whether SS and PD are causally related, we conducted a Mendelian randomization study (MR) with two samples. Data for SS derived from the FinnGen consortium's R9 release (2495 cases and 365 533 controls). Moreover, data for PD were acquired from the publicly available GWAS of European ancestry, which involved 33 674 cases and 449 056 controls. The inverse variance weighted, along with four other effective methodologies, were employed to comprehensively infer the causal relationships between SS and PD. To assess the estimation's robustness, a number of sensitivity studies were performed. To determine the probability of reverse causality, we performed a reverse MR analysis. There was no evidence of a significant causal effect of SS on PD risks based on the MR [odds ratio (OR) = 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.95-1.11; p = .45]. Similarly, no evidence supported the causal effects of PD on SS (OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.81-1.04; p = .20). These findings held up under rigorous sensitivity analysis.

A two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to investigate the causal associations between RA, cataract and glaucoma in European and East Asian populations. In the European population, genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for cataract (372,386 individuals) and glaucoma (377,277 individuals) were obtained from the FinnGen consortium (R9), while RA summary data were derived from a meta-analysis of GWAS encompassing 97173 samples. In the East Asian population, summary data for cataract (212453 individuals), glaucoma (212453 individuals), and RA (22515 individuals) were sourced from the IEU Open GWAS project. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW, random-effects) method served as the primary analysis, complemented by MR‒Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode and simple mode methods. Additionally, various sensitivity tests, including Cochran's Q test, MR‒Egger intercept, MR pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier test and leave-one-out test were performed to detect the heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy and stability of the analysis results. Following stringent screening, the number of selected instrumental variables ranged from 8 to 56.

Nevertheless, the causal relationship of SE on CRC remains unknown. A two-sample Mendelian randomization study was performed with the summary statistics of SE (27:1/14:0) which is from the largest available genome-wide association study meta-analysis(n = 377277) conducted by FinnGen consortium. The summary data were obtained from UK Biobank repository (377673 cases and 372016 controls).

However, it remains unclear whether there is a direct cause-and-effect link between mood swings and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). A STROBE-compliant cross-sectional observational study was conducted and analyzed using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to examine the potential causal relationship between mood swings and a range of CVDs, such as arrhythmia, artery aneurysm, coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, hypertension, stroke, ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease. We sourced genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data for mood swings from the UK Biobank, and for CVDs from the GWAS Catalog and FinnGen databases. We excluded single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to potential confounders such as obesity, smoking, sex, diabetes, as well as SNPs suspected of horizontal pleiotropy, as identified by MR-PRESSO and the MR-pleiotropy method, prior to the final analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using the MR-Egger, inverse variance weighted, and leave-one-out methods. After screening, 57 SNPs were identified as instrumental variables for mood swings, and 9 SNPs related to confounding factors were excluded. An increase in mood swing frequency is correlated with a significant increase in the likelihood of various conditions. Notably, arrhythmia in the FinnGen dataset showed an odds ratio (OR: 2.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44-3.61, P < .001), and atrial fibrillation had an OR (OR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.23-4.11, P = .01). CHD risk was elevated in both the IEU OpenGWAS project (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.30-3.21, P < .001) and GWAS Catalog (OR: 4.45, 95% CI: 1.75-11.33, P < .001).

FinnGen,38148419,Causal relationship between cigarette smoking behaviors and the risk of hernias: a Mendelian randomization study.,"As the global population continues to age, there is a noticeable yearly rise in the incidence of hernias. Simultaneously, smoking, a widespread addictive behavior and a significant contributor to mortality, has evolved into a pervasive public health concern. Existing literature has already established a connection between smoking and an increased risk of postoperative recurrence and postoperative infections following hernia surgery. However, there remains a dearth of research exploring the association between smoking and hernia morbidity. In this study, our objective is to systematically evaluate the causal relationship between cigarette smoking behaviors and hernia morbidity using a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. Hernia-related data were sourced from the FinnGen Biobank database, while cigarette smoking behavior data were gathered from the GWAS and Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine Use. To assess the causal relationship, we employed five methods: the weighted median, the weighted mode the inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and the simple mode. Sensitivity analysis was conducted, incorporating Cochran's Q test, the MR-Egger intercept test, leave-one-out analysis, and funnel plot. The presentation of the causal relationship is expressed as an odds ratio (OR) along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Employing the IVW method as the reference standard, we found that smoking intensity is associated with an increased risk of diaphragmatic hernia (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.00-1.46, P = 0.047). These consistent findings were further corroborated by the weighted median and weighted mode methods (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.03-1.54, P = 0.026; OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.52, P = 0.045). Conversely, when applying the IVW method, we identified no statistically significant causal relationship between smoking age, smoking initiation status, smoking cessation status, and the incidence of hernia. Our MR study has uncovered genetic evidence linking smoking intensity and the occurrence of diaphragmatic hernia. The risk of developing diaphragmatic hernia rises in tandem with the intensity of smoking.

However, it is not clear how biomarkers of inflammation are causally related to infertility. To explore whether genetic variants in circulating cytokines are associated with the pathogenesis of infertility, we performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. A total of 31,112 individuals of European ancestry were included in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 47 circulating cytokines as instrumental variables (IVs). Outcome data were female infertility, including four different subtypes, and male infertility, from the FinnGen consortium. Five MR methods, including inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, simple mode, weighted median, and weighted mode were employed to examine the genetic association between cytokines and the risk of female infertility and male infertility. The false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. After FDR correction, cis-protein quantitative trait locus (cis-pQTL) instruments showed that the cytokines GROa and MCSF were positively associated with female infertility. In analyses of subtypes of female infertility, eotaxin and sICAM were inversely associated with ovulation-related infertility; MCP3 alone was positively associated with uterus-related infertility; GROa and MCSF were positively correlated with infertility of cervical, vaginal, and other or unspecified origin; and MIP1a was negatively correlated with tubal origin infertility. The cytokines HGF, IL-2ra, and RANTES were positively correlated with male infertility. Similar findings were obtained in sensitivity analyses. There was no evidence of pleiotropy or heterogeneity in the results. These findings contribute to current understanding of the role of cytokine biomarkers in the etiology of female and male infertility.

FinnGen,38240193,Genetic association of circulating interleukins and risk of colorectal cancer: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"Previous studies have reported that inflammation, especially interleukin family members, plays an important role in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, because of various confounders and the lack of clinical randomized controlled trial, the causal relationship between genetically predicted level of interleukin family and CRC risk has not been fully explained. Bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted to investigate the causal association between interleukin family members and CRC. Several genetic variables were extracted as instrumental variables (IVs) from summary data of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for interleukin and CRC. IVs of interleukin family were obtained from recently published GWAS studies and the summary data of CRC was from FinnGen Biobank. After a series of quality control measures and strict screening, six models were used to evaluate the causal relationship. Pleiotropy, heterogeneity test, and a variety of sensitivity analysis were also used to estimate the robustness of the model results. Genetically predicted higher circulating levels of IL-2 (odds ratio [OR]: 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63-0.92; p = .0043), IL-17F(OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.62-1.00; p = .015), and IL-31 (OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79-0.98; p = .023) were suggestively associated with decreased CRC risk. However, higher level of IL-10 (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.18-1.65; p = .000094) was causally associated with increased risk of CRC. Reverse MR results indicated that the exposure of CRC was suggestively associated with higher levels of IL-36α (OR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.01-1.49; p = .040) and IL-17RD (OR: 1.22; 95% CI, 1.00-1.48; p = .048) and lower level of IL-13 (OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.65-0.95; p = .013). The overall MR results did not provide evidence for causal relationships between other interleukins and CRC (p > .05).

This study aimed to investigate the causal association between plasma TSH levels and cardiovascular diseases, particularly ischemic heart disease and heart failure (HF). Summary statistics from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit Open genome-wide association studies Project and FinnGen consortium were used to investigate the causal relationship between plasma TSH levels and the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using inverse-variance weighting as the primary method was performed.

In the secondary analysis, genetically determined higher TSH levels were associated with a higher risk for unstable angina pectoris (OR 1.0913, 95% CI 1.0350-1.1507), but were associated with a lower risk for HF + overweight (OR 0.9265, 95% CI 0.8821-0.9731). These results were further validated using sensitivity analysis. Our findings show that increased plasma TSH levels in patients with euthyroidism may increase the risk of unstable angina pectoris but reduce the risk of HF in overweight patients. This evidence indicates that plasma TSH levels may need to be carefully controlled in specific patients.",Medicine,2024,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Overweight; Heart Failure; Myocardial Ischemia; Angina, Unstable; Thyrotropin",False,7
FinnGen,39725839,The causal association between asthma and the risk of frailty: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"The correlation between asthma and frailty is increasingly garnering attention. The association between asthma and frailty remains inconclusive in observational studies, and the causality of this relationship still needs to be established. Therefore, we employed two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses using genetic instruments to determine the causal association of asthma on frailty. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to assess the causal effect of asthma on frailty. The genetic variants strongly associated with asthma (P < 5E-08) during the discovery and replication stages were derived from a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (N = 408,442) in the UK Biobank and a GWAS in the FinnGen Consortium (N = 217,421), respectively. Summary statistics of the frailty index (N = 175,226) are derived from the latest released GWAS dataset on frailty index. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was employed as the primary approach for calculating estimated values, with additional sensitivity analyses and heterogeneity analyses utilized to further validate the results. Using the IVW method, genetic susceptibility to asthma was associated with an increased risk of frailty in the discovery stage (odds ratio [OR] = 1.092, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.075-1.109, P = 5.00E-28), which was also validated in the replication stage (OR = 1.073, 95% CI = 1.052-1.096, P = 1.41E-11). Sensitivity analyses yielded consistent causal estimate, and no significant pleiotropy was found throughout the MR study. The present study demonstrated that asthma is causally associated with an elevated risk of frailty. Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential pathophysiological mechanisms between asthma and frailty.",Aging clinical and experimental research,2024,"Asthma; Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Frailty; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Aged",False,4
FinnGen,39696529,Investigating the causal relationship between immune factors and ankylosing spondylitis: insights from a Mendelian Randomization study.,"Despite previous studies indicating a close relationship between immune system and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the causal relationship between them remains unclear. Genome-wide association data were utilized to explore the causal link between 731 immune cells and AS using a bidirectional two-sample MR approach. The data included immune cell data from Orrù et al.'s study and AS data from the FinnGen consortium. Cochran's Q test and leave-one-out checked instrument variable (IV) heterogeneity. IVW was the primary method for causal analysis, with MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO addressing horizontal pleiotropy. FDR correction was applied to both analysis directions to rectify multiple testing errors. In our study, 22 immune phenotypes out of 731 were casually linked to AS. After excluding 5 less robust features, 17 immune factors remained, with 4 being protective and the rest posing risks. Through FDR correction, we found a significant causal relationship between HLA DR on CD14- CD16+ monocyte and AS (OR (95%CI) = 0.70(0.60 ~ 0.83), P = 2.06*10 Our study identified various features associated with AS in different types of immune cells.

FinnGen,38232082,Causal associations between liver enzymes and diabetic microvascular complications: A univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization.,"Observational studies show that liver enzymes are diabetes risk factors. However, previous observational investigations on the relationship between liver enzymes and diabetic microvascular complications produced contradictory results. The purpose of this research is to examine the independent causal effects of liver enzymes on diabetic microvascular complications. Univariable Mendelian randomization (UVMR) and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) were utilized to disentangle the causal effects. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary-level statistics were collected from the UK biobank and the FinnGen consortium. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as genetic instruments with genome-wide significance (p < 5 ×10-8). Five UVMR approaches, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), Bayesian weighted Mendelian randomization, MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO), weighted median, and MR-Egger, and three MVMR approaches, including the extended versions of IVW, MR-Egger, and the Q-minimization methods, were performed to evaluate the causal effects. The robustness of the MR results was further confirmed using several sensitivity analyses. UVMR revealed that a genetically predisposed per standard deviation increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level increased the risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (IVW OR = 1.489, 95% CI = 1.206-1.772, p = 0.006). Likewise, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels showed similar results (IVW OR = 1.376, 95% CI = 1.115-1.638, p = 0.017). Furthermore, these effects were consistent after controlling for glycemia and blood pressure using MVMR analysis. Additionally, sensitivity analyses further strengthened the causality. However, no significant associations were found between alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and diabetic microvascular complications. Robust evidence was demonstrated for an independent causal effect of serum ALT or AST concentration on the risk of DR in T2DM. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the potential biological mechanisms and confirm their clinical significance for early prevention and intervention.",PloS one,2024,"Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Bayes Theorem; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Diabetic Retinopathy; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Liver",False,8
FinnGen,38551704,Assessment of bidirectional relationships between autoimmune diseases and primary ovarian insufficiency: insights from a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis.,"The simultaneous occurrence of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and autoimmune diseases has been noted and debated in some epidemiological research. This bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study aimed to investigate the causal relationships between autoimmune diseases and POI. We obtained summary-level data for ten autoimmune diseases and POI from published large-scale genome-wide association studies and the FinnGen consortium of European ancestry. A series of filtering steps was performed to discern independent genetic variants. Causal estimates were mainly calculated by the inverse variance weighting method and verified through multiple sensitivity analyses. Of the ten autoimmune diseases, genetically predicted Addison's disease (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.47, P = 0.003) and systemic lupus erythematosus (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.24, P = 0.021) were associated with an increased risk of POI, and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. In addition, there were weak associations between liability to POI and elevated risks of type 1 diabetes (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.10, P = 0.046) and autoimmune thyroid disease (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, P = 0.015).

A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted to ascertain the causal connection between the 2 disorders. In our two-sample MR analysis, we identified independent genetic variants associated with CeD using publicly accessible GWAS data from people of European ancestry. Summary data for sarcoidosis were obtained from the FinnGen Consortium, the UK-Biobank, and a large GWAS dataset. To assess the association between CeD and sarcoidosis, our MR analysis used inverse variance weighted (IVW) as the primary method, incorporating the MR-Egger, weighted median (WM), and MR-PRESSO (outliers test) as a complementary method. In order to ensure that the findings were reliable, several sensitivity analyses were performed. Our study indicated that CeD had a significant causal relationship with sarcoidosis (IVW odds ratio (OR) = 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-1.20, P = 5.58E-05; WM OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03-1.23, P = 1.03E-02; MR-Egger OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.96-1.19, P = 2.20E-01). Additionally, we obtain the same results in the duplicated datasets as well, which makes our results even more reliable. The results of this investigation did not reveal any evidence of horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity. Our MR analysis showed a causal effect between CeD and an elevated risk of sarcoidosis.

FinnGen,37522462,Body mass index and risk of inflammatory breast disease: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Introduction: in previous studies, obesity was identified as a risk factor for inflammatory breast disease, but its causality is uncertain. In the present study, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analysis to investigate the causal relationship between obesity and inflammatory breast disease. Methods: we use body mass index (BMI) as a measure of obesity. Data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BMI were obtained from UK Biobank. Data for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with mastitis were obtained from FinnGen Biobank. We used several MR analysis methods, such as inverse-variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode and weighted mode to make our results more convincing. We also performed MR-PRESSO test, MR-Egger test, heterogeneity test, pleiotropy test and leave-one-out analysis to make our analysis results more robust and credible. We used odds ratio (OR) to evaluate the causal relationship between BMI and mastitis. Results: based on the IVW random effects model, we found that a one-standard deviation (SD) increase in BMI increased the risk of mastitis by 62.1 % (OR = 1.621, 95 % CI: 1.262-2.083, p = 1.59E-4), which is almost consistent with the results of several other methods. Conclusions: in European individuals, an increase in the number of BMI increases the risk of inflammatory breast disease. People with high BMI need to control their weight to reduce the incidence of inflammatory breast disease. Introducción: en estudios previos, la obesidad se identificó como un factor de riesgo para la enfermedad inflamatoria de mama, pero su causalidad es incierta. En el presente estudio, se realizó un análisis de aleatorización mendeliana de dos muestras (TSMR) para investigar la relación causal entre la obesidad y la enfermedad inflamatoria de mama. Métodos: se empleó el índice de masa corporal (IMC) como medida de obesidad. Los datos de los polimorfismos de nucleótido único (SNP) asociados con el IMC se obtuvieron del Biobank de Reino Unido y los datos de los polimorfismos de nucleótido único (SNP) asociados con la mastitis se obtuvieron de FinnGen Biobank. Se utilizaron varios métodos de análisis de RM, como la ponderación inversa de la varianza (IVW), RM-Egger, mediana ponderada, modo simple y modo ponderado para que nuestros resultados fueran más convincentes. También se realizaron la prueba MR-PRESSO, la prueba MR-Egger, la prueba de heterogeneidad, el test de pleiotropía y la validación dejando uno fuera (en inglés, leave-one-out) para que los resultados de nuestro análisis fueran más sólidos y creíbles. Se utilizó la odds ratio (OR) para evaluar la relación causal entre el IMC y la mastitis. Resultados: basándonos en el modelo de efectos aleatorios IVW, se halló que un aumento de una desviación estándar (DE) en el IMC aumentaba el riesgo de mastitis en un 62,1 % (OR = 1,621, IC 95 %: 1,262-2,083, p = 1,59E-4), que es casi consistente con los resultados de otros diversos métodos.

FinnGen,39465791,Mendelian randomization study reveals a causal relationship between body mass index in children and risk of autoimmune diseases.,"Newly emerging evidence indicates that body mass index (BMI) is a potential risk factor for autoimmune diseases (ADs). Nevertheless, the exact causal connection between ADs and BMI in children remains uncertain. To investigate the relationship between BMI in children and ADs, a 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted. In this analysis, several regression methods were utilized, including the inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted mode, weighted median, and MR-Egger regression. Publicly available summary statistics datasets from meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were employed, specifically focusing on BMI in children of European descent (n = 39,620) from the UK Biobank (ebi-a-GCST90002409) as the exposure group. The outcomes were derived from individuals included in the Finnish biobank study FinnGen, with 42,202 cases and 176,590 controls representing the ADs group (finngen_R5_AUTOIMMUNE). For instrumental variables, we carefully selected 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from GWAS on BMI in children. Our analysis implemented the IVW method, which demonstrated supporting evidence for a causal association between BMI in children and ADs. The results indicated a significant effect with a beta coefficient of 0.22, standard error (SE) of 0.05, odds ratio (OR) of 1.25, and a 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from 1.13 to 1.38, with a P-value of <.05. We also utilized the weighted median method, which yielded similar findings to the IVW method. The OR estimates from the weighted median analysis showed a beta coefficient of 0.20, SE of 0.06, OR of 1.22, and a 95% CI ranging from 1.08 to 1.36, with a P-value of <.05. No significant association was observed in the MR-Egger and Weighted mode analyses.

The study employed the MR analysis, leveraging genetic variants as instrumental variables to facilitate robust causal inference. Data for gut microbiota was extracted from the MiBioGen study, integrating genome-wide genotyping data with 16S fecal microbiota profiles. Outcome metrics were based on the Finngen study. Genetic instruments were meticulously extracted based on stringent criteria, and harmonized with SNP outcomes associated with ""Poisoning by narcotics and psychodysleptics (hallucinogens)"". The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was utilized for MR analysis, supplemented by sensitivity analyses including MR-Egger Regression, Weighted Median Approach, and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation. Among various microbial groups, nine showed significant statistical links. Specifically, Class Negativicutes (OR 5.68, 95% CI 2.13-15.16, p = 0.0005) and Order Selenomonadales (OR 5.68, 95% CI 2.13-15.16, p = 0.0005) were notably associated. These findings were consistent across different sensitivity analyses. The relationship between gut microbiota and the adverse effects of narcotics and psychodysleptics is an emerging area of research. Our MR study identifies certain microbes that might influence the body's response to these substances.

In order to investigate the possible causal relationships, we used a Mendelian randomization analysis. Data for generically predicted breast cancer were identified based on the BCAC consortium. A meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) comprising 1,500,861 participants for VTE as well as data from the FinnGen study for VTE, DVT and PE was used for the causal-effect estimation. Our primary method was inverse-variance weighted (IVW), and our supplementary methods included weighted median and MR-Egger. We also carried out sensitivity analysis for the study. No evidence of causal-effect was detected of overall breast cancer on VTE in both the GWAS meta-analysis (OR=1.01, 95%CI:0.98-1.04, p = 0.495) and the FinnGen consortium (OR=1.00,95%CI:0.96-1.04, p = 0.945).

The mechanism underlying IBS remains unclear, and little evidence exists for clarifying the causal relationship between blood metabolites and IBS. We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study using two samples. Exposure data for 7824 Europeans were extracted from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on metabolite levels. The IBS GWAS data from the GWAS database were used for the initial analysis. The primary analysis of causal relationships was conducted using inverse-variance weighting (IVW) with MR-Egger and weighted medians as supplementary analyses. Sensitivity analyses were performed using a combination of the Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier, and leave-one-out analysis. For significant associations, replication and meta-analyses were performed using additional independent IBS case GWAS data released by the FinnGen Consortium R9. To identify the metabolites, score regression, confounding analysis, and reverse MR were performed to further assess the causal relationships between the metabolites. After rigorous screening, we identified four known metabolites to be associated with IBS (stearate, odds ratio [OR]: 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-0.92; arginine, OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.07-1.74; 1-palmitoylglycerol, OR:1.49, 95% CI: 1.07-2.07; 1-palmitoylglycerophosphoinositol, OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.71-0.99).

However, sun exposure remains ambiguous in its relationship to CRC. We carried out a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to explore the potential associations between them. We examined the exposure to sunlight summary statistics of the UK Biobank Consortium using a 2-sample MR analysis. Using data from the FinnGen consortium, we derived summary statistics for CRC. We conducted our analysis with various methods, incorporating inverse variance weighted (IVW) along with 4 other approaches. A Cochran Q statistic was used to measure the heterogeneity of instrumental variables (IVs). We screened 133 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (time spent outdoors in summer), 41 SNPs (time spent outdoors in winter), and 35 SNPs (frequency of solarium/sunlamp use) representing sunlight exposure for MR analysis. All selected SNPs had an F-statistic >20, indicating that IVs did not weakly bias the results. The summer outdoor activity trait exhibited significant heterogeneity (Cochran Q statistic = 183.795, P = .002 < 0.05), but we found no horizontal polymorphisms or significant heterogeneity for the other exposure traits. According to IVW estimates, no causal association exists between time spent outdoors in summer and CRC (Odds Ratio, OR = 0.735, 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.494-1.017, P = .128 > 0.017). No causal relationship existed between time spent outdoors in winter and CRC, as indicated by Bonferroni-corrected adjusted p-values. The OR was 0.877 with a 95% CI of 0.334-2.299, and the P value was .789, more significant than the significance threshold of 0.017. The solarium/sunlamp use frequency was not associated with CRC (OR = 1.567, 95%CI = 0.243-10.119, P = .637 > .017). Also, an IVW with random effects was applied to determine the causal relationship between summer outdoor time and CRC. No causal association between summer outdoor time and CRC was found (OR = 0.735, 95% CI = 0.494-1.017, P = .128 > .017). Additionally, 4 additional analyses yielded similar results. The findings of our study suggest that exposure to sunlight may reduce CRC risk, but the causal relationship remains unsolved. There is no evidence to suggest that exposure to sunlight prevents CRC.

Autoimmune thyroiditis is the most common autoimmune endocrine disease and could overlap with other autoimmune diseases. It remains elusive whether autoimmune thyroiditis affects the risk of AAV development. We performed a 2-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to explore the true association between autoimmune thyroiditis and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), a subtype of AAV. Independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis or Grave disease with genome-wide significance were selected as instrumental variables from large genome-wide association study.

FinnGen,39772304,Causal association between gut microbiome and polycystic ovary syndrome: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"Through implementing a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study, the causal effects between gut microbiome and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were analyzed. Summary statistics for PCOS were acquired from the FinnGen consortium R8 release data, which included 27,943 cases and 162,936 controls. The inverse-variance weighting (IVW) method was adopted for analysis. Additionally, the causality involving exposure plus the outcome was evaluated by means of MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode methods, as well as weighted mode. The IVW estimate showed that the genera Streptococcus plus Enterorhabdus served as protectors of PCOS. By contrast, the phylum Tenericutes, genera Anaerofilum, Coprococcus 2, Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group and Ruminiclostridium 5 were identified as risk elements of PCOS. Based on reverse MR analyses from PCOS on the intestinal microbiome based on the IVW method, the phyla Tenericutes, Actinobacteria, class Actinobacteria, genera Ruminococcaceae UCG004 and Christensenellaceae R 7group exhibited a down-regulation effect after PCOS onset. The genera Bacteroides, Barnesiella, Erysipelotrichaceae UCG003, Ruminococcus gnavus group, and Veillonella were up-regulated. No horizontal pleiotropy or significant IV heterogeneity was observed. We conclude that there is a causality relationship between gut microbiome and PCOS, where some bacterial taxa can be used as biomarkers to promote targeted diagnosis and therapy for PCOS. Grâce à la mise en œuvre d’une étude de randomisation mendélienne (MR) bidirectionnelle, les effets causals entre le microbiome intestinal et le syndrome des ovaires polykystiques (SOPK) ont été analysés. Les statistiques récapitulatives sur le SOPK ont été acquises à partir des données de diffusion R8 du consortium FinnGen, qui comprenaient 27 943 cas et 162 936 contrôles. La méthode de pondération de variance inverse (IVW) a été adoptée pour l'analyse. De plus, la causalité impliquant l'exposition et le résultat a été évaluée au moyen des méthodes MR-Egger, de la médiane pondérée, du mode simple, ainsi que du mode pondéré. L'estimation IVW a montré que les genres Streptococcus et Enterorhabdus servaient de protecteurs du SOPK. En revanche, le phylum Tenericutes, les genres Anaerofilum, Coprococcus 2, le groupe Lachnospiraceae ND3007 et Ruminiclostridium 5 ont été identifiés comme éléments de risque du SOPK. Sur la base d'analyses IRM inverse du SOPK sur le microbiome intestinal basées sur la méthode IVW, les phyla Tenericutes, Actinobacteria, classe Actinobacteria, genres Ruminococcaceae UCG004 et Christensenellaceae R 7group ont présenté un effet de régulation négative après l'apparition du SOPK. Les genres Bacteroides, Barnesiella, Erysipelotrichaceae UCG003, le groupe Ruminococcus gnavus et Veillonella étaient régulés positivement.

This study was dedicated to investigate the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and intervertebral disc degeneration and the presence of potentially bacterial traits using two-sample Mendelian randomization. A two-sample Mendelian randomization study was performed using the summary statistics of the gut microbiota from the largest available genome-wide association study meta-analysis conducted by the MiBioGen consortium. Summary statistics of intervertebral disc degeneration were obtained from the FinnGen consortium R8 release data. Five basic methods and MR-PRESSO were used to examine causal associations. The results of the study were used to examine the causal association between gut microbiota and intervertebral disc degeneration. Cochran's Q statistics were used to quantify the heterogeneity of instrumental variables. By using Mendelian randomization analysis, 10 bacterial traits potentially associated with intervertebral disc degeneration were identified: genus Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group, genus Lachnoclostridium, unknown genus id.2755, genus Marvinbryantia, genus Ruminococcaceae UCG003, family Rhodospirillaceae, unknown genus id.959, order Rhodospirillales, genus Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 grou, genus Eubacterium brachy group. This Mendelian Randomization study found a causal effect between 10 gut microbiota and intervertebral disc degeneration, and we summarize the possible mechanisms of action in the context of existing studies.

For the primary analysis, we employed proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) studies using 738 cis-acting protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) for 735 plasma proteins from the 5 published studies. For external validation, we conducted 2-sample MR analyses using plasma pQTLs of the screened proteins from another study by deCODE genetics. Moreover, we performed a series of sensitivity analyses including reverse MR and Bayesian colocalization tests. The primary MR identified 4 plasma proteins that were associated with DD risk including CCN3/NOV (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-0.99; P = 1.2 × 10-11 for UKBB. OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66-0.81; P = 7.2 × 10-10 for FinnGen). The validation MR well replicated the primary result of CCN3/NOV (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.96; P = 1.9 × 10-11 for UKBB. OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.33-0.56; P = 7.0 × 10-10 for FinnGen). Sensitivity analyses supported the causal association.

FinnGen,39733319,The Role of Sex Hormones and Sex Hormone-binding Globulin in Functional Gatrointestinal Disorders: A Bidirectional Two-sample Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) have been confirmed to involve in the pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD). However, causal associations have not yet been investigated. Utilizing data from Genome-wide association studies, we conducted bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess the causal relationships between sex hormones, SHBG and FGIDs. Data for sex hormones including testosterone and estradiol, and SHBG were collected from the UK Biobank and FinnGen study. Relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental variables (IVs). Inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis were performed to assess the causal relationships., supplemented with MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode approaches. Additionally, we used Cochran's Q test to evaluate the heterogeneity of genetic variants and implemented leave-one-out analysis to assess the impact of individual SNPs on the causal estimates. Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. Significant negative causal relationship was found between genetically predicted testosterone and the risk of IBS (OR=0.90, 95%CI: 0.83-0.97; p=0.007). SHBG demonstrated an inverse correlation with the risk of IBS (OR=0.82, 95%CI: 0.68-0.98; p=0.035) and FD (OR=0.83, 95%CI: 0.69-0.99; p=0.048). However, no statistically significant association was found between testosterone and FD, while estradiol also showed no causal association with FGIDs. Our study revealed a negative causal relationship between testosterone and IBS risk, and SHBG appears to be inversely associated with FD. This provided new ideas for the prevention and control of IBS, and future research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these associations and their potential clinical implications.",Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genome-Wide Association Study; Testosterone; Risk Factors; Irritable Bowel Syndrome; Estradiol; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Female; Dyspepsia; Phenotype; Male; Gonadal Steroid Hormones",False,2
FinnGen,38198782,The Association of Glaucoma with Ischemic Stroke and Functional Outcome after Ischemic Stroke from the Perspective of Causality.,"Glaucoma may be related to ischemic stroke (IS) and poor outcomes after IS in observational studies, while the causal association remains unclear. We obtained single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to glaucoma from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted by the FinnGen consortium. The GWAS included a total of 13,614 cases and 295,540 controls. The summary-level datasets regarding IS were collected from the MEGASTROKE consortium, including 34,217 cases and 406,111 controls. Furthermore, we acquired summary statistics datasets for functional outcomes following IS from the GWAS meta-analysis conducted by the GISCOME consortium, which involved 6,021 individuals. The genetic association estimates for functional outcomes at 90 days after IS were evaluated by the modified Rankin Score (mRS), including 3,741 cases with good functional outcomes (mRS = 0-2) and 2,280 subjects with poor functional outcomes post-stroke (mRS = 3-6). Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the primary method, complemented by sensitivity analyses for pleiotropy and increasing robustness. Genetically, glaucoma is associated with an increased risk of IS (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-1.14, p = 0.0039), as well as poor prognosis after IS with adjustment for severity (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.27-2.13, p = 0.0001) and functional outcome after IS (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.12-1.87, p = 0.0038). Through sensitivity analyses, we confirmed the robustness of the results. In addition, we did not identify any causal association between IS, functional outcome after IS, and glaucoma in reverse analysis. Our study provides evidence suggesting potential genetic causal effects of glaucoma on an increased risk of IS, as well as a poor functional outcome following IS. Future studies are necessary to confirm these findings.","Cerebrovascular diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Ischemic Stroke; Glaucoma; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Risk Assessment; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Prognosis; Functional Status; Case-Control Studies; Disability Evaluation; Time Factors; Phenotype; Recovery of Function",False,7

However, the specific mechanism behind this phenomenon remains unclear. We aimed to examine the association between fetuin-A levels in thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) and risk of TAAs and to evaluate whether this association was causal. A total of 26 SNPs were selected as instrumental variables for fetuin-A in 9,055 participants of European ancestry from the CHARGE consortium, and their effects on thoracic aortic aneurysm and decreased descending thoracic aortic diameter were separately estimated in 353,049 and 39,688 individuals from FinnGen consortium. We used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine the causal association. At the same time, we employed various methods, including random-effects inverse variance weighting, weighted median, MR Egger regression, and MR PRESSO, to ensure the robustness of causal effects. We assessed heterogeneity using Cochran's Q value and examined horizontal pleiotropy through MR Egger regression and retention analysis. Fetuin-A level was associated with a significantly decreasing risk of thoracic aortic aneurysm (odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 - 0.87,  Serum fetuin-A level was negatively associated with risk of TTAs and correlated with the decreased descending thoracic aortic diameter.

FinnGen,39148320,Lack of genetic association of non-melanoma skin cancer and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma.,"Prior research has shown a positive association of pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (PXG) in patients with non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), likely due to an increase in ultraviolet exposure associated with both. However, the role of NMSC as a genetic risk factor for PXG has not been examined. Thus, the goal of this study is to utilize Mendelian randomization with genome-wide association studies to evaluate for genetic causality while controlling for environmental confounders. We conducted a MR using the inverse variance weighted method (MR-IVW) as our primary analysis. Genomic data was sourced from GWASs for patients with NMSC (10,382 cases, 208,410 controls) and PXG (1,515 cases and 210,201 controls), originating from the FinnGen Biobank. Despite previous association of history of NMSC with occurrence of PXG, we found no evidence for a causal association between SNPs associated with NMSC and risk of PXG following MR analysis (MR-IVW, odds ratio (OR): 0.98, 95% CI: 0.85-1.14, P = 0.87).

These observations may reflect the adverse impact of intrauterine growth restriction on a child's health. However, causal evidence supporting such a mechanism in humans is largely lacking. Using Mendelian Randomization and 36,211 genotyped mother-child pairs from the FinnGen study, we assessed the relationship between intrauterine growth and five common health outcomes (coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension, statin use, type 2 diabetes and cancer). We proxied intrauterine growth with polygenic scores for maternal effects on birth weight and took into account the transmission of genetic variants between a mother and a child in the analyses. We find limited evidence for contribution of normal variation in maternally influenced intrauterine growth on later-life disease. Instead, we find support for genetic pleiotropy in the fetal genome linking birth weight to CHD and hypertension.

Our study examined the connection between GERD and the risk of hypertension and assessed further whether this correlation has a causal relationship. First, we utilized the National Readmission Database including 14 422 183 participants to conduct an observational study. Dividing the population into GERD and non-GERD groups, we investigated the correlation between GERD and EH using multivariate logistic regression. Next, bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization was adopted. The summary statistics for GERD were obtained from a published genome-wide association study including 78 707 cases and 288 734 controls. We collected summary statistics for hypertension containing 70 651 cases and 223 663 controls from the FinnGen consortium. We assessed causality primarily by the inverse-variance weighted method with validation by four other Mendelian randomization approaches as well as an array of sensitivity analyses. In the unadjusted model, GERD patients had a higher risk of EH than the non-GERD group, regardless of gender (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval: 1.42-1.43; P < .001). Further adjusting for critical confounders did not change this association. For Mendelian randomization, we found that genetically predicted GERD was causally linked to an enhanced risk of EH in inverse-variance weighted technique (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval: 1.39-1.67; P = 3.51 × 10-18); conversely, EH did not raise the risk of GERD causally.

FinnGen,39470534,Serum iron status and the risk of female infertility in European populations: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"The relationship between iron status and female infertility has been observed in several studies, yet its causal nature remains ambiguous. We employed univariate Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to explore the potential causal connection between these 2 factors. For our analysis, genetic instrumental variables pertaining to iron status were selected using data from the Iron Status Genetics Consortium, encompassing 48,972 individuals of European descent from 19 cohorts (11 discovery and 8 replication). For female infertility data, we referred to FinnGen Consortium Release 9, which includes 11,442 cases and 107,564 controls. Our MR approach utilized both a conservative strategy (involving single nucleotide polymorphisms pertinent to general iron status) and a liberal strategy (encompassing single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to any iron status indicator). The conservative approach relied on inverse variance-weighted methods, whereas the liberal strategy integrated inverse variance weighted with MR-Egger regression, the weighted median approach, and simple mode techniques. The conservative strategy did not reveal a significant link between iron status and female infertility risk. Conversely, the liberal strategy indicated a positive correlation specifically between serum iron levels and female infertility risk (odds ratio from MR: 1.225; 95% confidence interval: 1.064-1.410; P = .030), while no significant associations were found for other iron indicators (P > 0.05). Our MR investigation suggests a potential positive association between serum iron levels and the risk of female infertility, while other iron markers do not appear to significantly influence this risk.

Summary-level GWAS data for OSA from the FinnGen consortium was used to identify genetically predicted OSA. Data regarding neurocognitive characteristics were obtained from published meta-analysis studies. Linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis was employed to reveal genetic correlations between OSA and related traits. Our MR study provided evidence that OSA was found to significantly increase the volume of the hippocampus (IVW β (95% CI) = 158.997 (76.768 to 241.227), P = 1.51e-04), with no heterogeneity and pleiotropy detected. Nominally causal effects of OSA on brain structures, such as the thickness of the temporal pole with or without global weighted, amygdala structure change, and cerebellum white matter change covering lifespan, were observed. Bidirectional causal links were also detected between brain cortical structure, brain subcortical, cognitive performance, and OSA risk.

Previous observational studies have shown associations between lipids and VTE, but causality remains unclear. Hence, by utilizing 241 lipid-related traits as exposures and data from the FinnGen consortium on VTE, DVT, and PE as outcomes, we conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate causal relationships between lipids and VTE, DVT and PE. The MR results identified that fatty acid (FA) unsaturation traits (ratio of bis-allylic bonds to double bonds in lipids, and ratio of bis-allylic bonds to total fatty acids in lipids) were associated with VTE (odds ratio [OR]=1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-1.27; OR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.13-1.30), DVT (OR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.16-1.33; OR= 1.26, 95% CI: 1.16-1.36) and PE (OR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.29; OR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.09-1.27). Phosphatidylcholines (PC) exhibit potential causal effects on VTE and PE.

However, there has not yet been a study investigating the joint association among genetics, lifestyle/environmental factors, and adherence to healthy lifestyle for risk of ARHL. We aimed to assess the association between ARHL genetic variants, lifestyle/environmental factors, and adherence to healthy lifestyle as pertains to risk of ARHL. This case-control study included 376,464 European individuals aged 40 to 69 years, enrolled between 2006 and 2010 in the UK Biobank (UKBB). As a replication set, we also included a total of 26,523 individuals considered of European ancestry and 9834 individuals considered of African-American ancestry through the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB). The polygenic risk score (PRS) for ARHL was derived from a sensorineural hearing loss genome-wide association study from the FinnGen Consortium and categorized as low, intermediate, high, and very high. We selected lifestyle/environmental factors that have been previously studied in association with hearing loss. A composite healthy lifestyle score was determined using seven selected lifestyle behaviors and one environmental factor. Of the 376,464 participants, 87,066 (23.1%) cases belonged to the ARHL group, and 289,398 (76.9%) individuals comprised the control group in the UKBB. A very high PRS for ARHL had a 49% higher risk of ARHL than those with low PRS (adjusted OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.36-1.62; P < .001), which was replicated in the PMBB cohort. A very poor lifestyle was also associated with risk of ARHL (adjusted OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 2.75-3.35; P < .001). These risk factors showed joint effects with the risk of ARHL. Conversely, adherence to healthy lifestyle in relation to hearing mostly attenuated the risk of ARHL even in individuals with very high PRS (adjusted OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09-0.52; P < .001). Our findings of this study demonstrated a significant joint association between genetic and lifestyle factors regarding ARHL.

Summary-level data for NAFLD were available from a GWAS meta-analysis (8434 cases and 770,180 controls), and data for 12 NAFLD-related features from corresponding published GWASs. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis was employed as the primary statistical method. Bidirectional MR and CAUSE analysis were conducted to avoid reverse causality and false positive findings. In univariable MR analyses, we found evidence to support a causal effect of genetically predicted sleep apnea on NAFLD (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.18-1.91) and HDL-C (β = -0.045, 95% CI = -0.090 to -0.001). In reverse MR, genetically predicted serum TG was associated with an increased risk of sleep apnea (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02-1.12), while genetically predicted HDL-C was associated with a decreased risk of sleep apnea (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.89-0.98). After adjusting body mass index or educational attainment, none of these causal associations were retained. However, CAUSE method and MR analyses focusing on lipoprotein subfractions supported a causal effect of sleep apnea on HDL-C and HDL subfractions. This MR study indicated that sleep apnea has no direct causal association with NAFLD, elevated liver enzymes and insulin resistance. Our results showed suggestive inverse associations of genetically predicted sleep apnea on HDL-C and HDL subfractions, indicating that both HDL-C levels and HDL function may be causally implicated in sleep apnea.",European journal of clinical investigation,2024,"Humans; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Body Mass Index; Causality; Sleep Apnea Syndromes; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,1
FinnGen,38498041,Thrombosis risk in single- and double-heterozygous carriers of factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A in FinnGen and the UK Biobank.,"The factor V Leiden (FVL; rs6025) and prothrombin G20210A (PTGM; rs1799963) polymorphisms are 2 of the most well-studied genetic risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, double heterozygosity (DH) for FVL and PTGM remains poorly understood, with previous studies showing marked disagreement regarding thrombosis risk conferred by the DH genotype. Using multidimensional data from the UK Biobank (UKB) and FinnGen biorepositories, we evaluated the clinical impact of DH carrier status across 937 939 individuals. We found that 662 participants (0.07%) were DH carriers. After adjustment for age, sex, and ancestry, DH individuals experienced a markedly elevated risk of VTE compared with wild-type individuals (odds ratio [OR] = 5.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.01-6.84; P = 4.8 × 10-34), which approximated the risk conferred by FVL homozygosity. A secondary analysis restricted to UKB participants (N = 445 144) found that effect size estimates for the DH genotype remained largely unchanged (OR = 4.53; 95% CI, 3.42-5.90; P < 1 × 10-16) after adjustment for commonly cited VTE risk factors, such as body mass index, blood type, and markers of inflammation. In contrast, the DH genotype was not associated with a significantly higher risk of any arterial thrombosis phenotype, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and peripheral artery disease. In summary, we leveraged population-scale genomic data sets to conduct, to our knowledge, the largest study to date on the DH genotype and were able to establish far more precise effect size estimates than previously possible. Our findings indicate that the DH genotype may occur as frequently as FVL homozygosity and may confer a similarly increased risk of VTE.",Blood,2024,"Humans; Prothrombin; Factor V; Female; Male; Heterozygote; Middle Aged; United Kingdom; Biological Specimen Banks; Aged; Risk Factors; Venous Thromboembolism; Adult; Thrombosis; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; UK Biobank",False,0
FinnGen,39180677,Causal associations of osteoporosis with stroke: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"This study employed bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationship between osteoporosis (OP) and stroke. Utilizing large-scale genome-wide association data revealed a reciprocal relationship: stroke increases the risk of OP, and vice versa. These findings underscore the importance of addressing both conditions for comprehensive patient care. The correlation between OP and stroke is unclear. This study used a two-sample bidirectional MR study to determine the causal relationship between OP and stroke. Summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used to perform MR analyses. Summary data for OP (n = 300,147), OP with pathological fracture (n = 239,702), and postmenopausal OP with pathological fracture (n = 182,601) were extracted from large-scale GWAS and meta-analyses of European populations in the FinnGen consortium. Similarly, summary data for stroke (n = 446,696), ischemic stroke (IS, n = 440,328), small vessel stroke (SVS, n = 198,048), large artery atherosclerosis stroke (LAS, n = 150,765), and cardioembolic stroke (CES, n = 211,763) were extracted from the MEGASTROKE consortium. Methods such as inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, and weighted median were applied to perform various outcome analyses for MR. The results demonstrated significant positive causality of stroke, IS, and LAS on OP (stroke: odds ratio [OR]: 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.85, and P = 0.027; IS, OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.05-3.87, and P = 0.035; LAS: OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.08-1.55, and P = 0.005), positive causality of LAS on OP with pathological fracture (LAS: OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.18-2.42, and P = 0.004), and positive causality of stroke and LAS on postmenopausal OP with pathological fracture (stroke: OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.05-3.87, and P = 0.035; LAS, OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.06-2.90, and P = 0.030). There was also a significant positive causal relationship between OP and SVS (OP, OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01-1.14, and P = 0.021). In conclusion, there is a causal relationship between stroke and OP, suggesting that they may be potential risk factors for each other. Therefore, patients with stroke should receive timely prevention for OP, OP with pathological fracture, and postmenopausal OP with pathological fracture. Similarly, patients with OP may need to be evaluated for potential cardiovascular risks.",Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Stroke; Osteoporosis; Female; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Fractures, Spontaneous; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Risk Factors; Male; Osteoporotic Fractures; Causality",False,2
FinnGen,38332312,Association between human blood metabolome and the risk of pre-eclampsia.,"Pre-eclampsia is a complex multi-system pregnancy disorder with limited treatment options. Therefore, we aimed to screen for metabolites that have causal associations with preeclampsia and to predict target-mediated side effects based on Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. A two-sample MR analysis was firstly conducted to systematically assess causal associations of blood metabolites with pre-eclampsia, by using metabolites related large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) involving 147,827 European participants, as well as GWASs summary data about pre-eclampsia from the FinnGen consortium R8 release data that included 182,035 Finnish adult female subjects (5922 cases and 176,113 controls). Subsequently, a phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR) analysis was applied to assess the potential on-target side effects associated with hypothetical interventions that reduced the burden of pre-eclampsia by targeting identified metabolites. Four metabolites were identified as potential causal mediators for pre-eclampsia by using the inverse-variance weighted method, including cholesterol in large HDL (L-HDL-C) [odds ratio (OR): 0.88; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.83-0.93; P = 2.14 × 10",Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,2024,"Adult; Pregnancy; Humans; Female; Pre-Eclampsia; Cholesterol Esters; Genome-Wide Association Study; Drug Delivery Systems; Metabolome; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,3

The causal nature of these relationships and, thus, the suitability of these markers as intervention targets for cancer prevention is unclear. We meta-analysed 6 genome-wide association studies of circulating inflammatory markers comprising 59,969 participants of European ancestry. We then used combined cis-Mendelian randomization and colocalisation analysis to evaluate the causal role of 66 circulating inflammatory markers in risk of 30 adult cancers in 338,294 cancer cases and up to 1,238,345 controls. Genetic instruments for inflammatory markers were constructed using genome-wide significant (P < 5.0 × 10 We found strong evidence to support an association of genetically-proxied circulating pro-adrenomedullin concentrations with increased breast cancer risk (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.10-1.29, q-value = 0.033, PPH Our comprehensive joint Mendelian randomization and colocalisation analysis of the role of circulating inflammatory markers in cancer risk identified potential roles for 4 circulating inflammatory markers in risk of 4 site-specific cancers.

The identification of proteins for pathogenesis and novel drug targets remains imperative. This study aims to investigate roles of circulating inflammatory proteins in diabetic renal complications. Data on the proteins were derived from a genome-wide protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) study, while data on diabetic renal complications came from the FinnGen study. In this study, proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses were used to assess the relationship between circulating inflammatory proteins and diabetic renal complications.

FinnGen,38319384,Association between green tea intake and digestive system cancer risk in European and East Asian populations: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Previous observational studies have shown that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced incidence of digestive system cancers (DSCs). However, the observed association could be due to confounding factors. Therefore, we used a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to assess the causal effect of green tea intake on the risk of five common DSCs. Independent genetic variants strongly associated with green tea consumption in European and East Asian populations were selected as instrumental variables in genome-wide association studies involving up to 64,949 European individuals and 152,653 East Asian individuals, respectively. The associations between genetic variants and DSCs were extracted from the FinnGen study and the Japan Biobank. The primary analysis was performed using random-effects inverse variance weighting (IVW). Other MR analyses, including weighted mode-based estimate, weighted-median, MR-Egger regression, Mendelian Randomization-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) analysis, were used for sensitivity analyses. In addition, a multivariate MR design was performed to adjust for smoking and alcohol consumption. The IVW results showed no causal relationship between tea intake and DSCs risk in European population (esophagus cancer: odds ratio (OR) = 1.044, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.992-1.099, p = 0.096; stomach cancer: OR = 0.988, 95% CI 0.963-1.014, p = 0.368; colorectal cancer: OR = 1.003, 95% CI 0.992-1.015, p = 0.588; liver cancer: OR = 0.996, 95% CI 0.960-1.032, p = 0.808; pancreatic cancer: OR = 0.990, 95% CI 0.965-1.015, p = 0.432). The MR-Egger regression, MR-PRESSO analysis and other methods also confirmed the reliability of the conclusion. Similarly, no significant association was found between green tea consumption and the incidence of DSCs among East Asians. This relationship is not significant even after adjusting for smoking and alcohol consumption (P > 0.05).

FinnGen,39243281,Gut microbiota and risk of ankylosing spondylitis.,"Observational studies have established a connection between gut microbiota and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) risk; however, whether the observed associations are causal remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the potential causal associations of gut microbiota with AS risk. Instrumental variants of gut microbiota were obtained from the MiBioGen consortium (n = 18,340) and the Dutch Microbiome Project (n = 7738). The FinnGen consortium provided genetic association summary statistics for AS, encompassing 2860 cases and 270,964 controls. We used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary analysis, supplemented with the weighted median method, maximum likelihood-based method, MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier test, and MR-Egger regression. In addition, we conducted a reverse MR analysis to assess the likelihood of reverse causality. After the Bonferroni correction, species Bacteroides vulgatus remained statistically significantly associated with AS risk (odds ratio (OR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-1.95, P = 2.55 × 10 Our results revealed the associations of several gut bacterial traits with AS risk, suggesting a potential causal role of gut microbiota in AS development. Nevertheless, additional research is required to clarify the mechanisms by which these bacteria influence AS risk.

FinnGen,38909219,Identification of lipid-modifying drug targets for autoimmune diseases: insights from drug target mendelian randomization.,"A growing body of evidence has highlighted the interactions of lipids metabolism and immune regulation. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of evidence regarding the causality between lipids and autoimmune diseases (ADs), as well as their possibility as drug targets for ADs. This study was conducted to comprehensively understand the casual associations between lipid traits and ADs, and evaluate the therapeutic possibility of lipid-lowering drug targets on ADs. Genetic variants for lipid traits and variants encoding targets of various lipid-lowering drugs were derived from Global Lipid Genetics Consortium (GLGC) and verified in Drug Bank. Summary data of ADs were obtained from MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (MER-IEU) database and FinnGen consortium, respectively. The causal inferences between lipid traits/genetic agents of lipid-lowering targets and ADs were evaluated by Mendelian randomization (MR), summary data-based MR (SMR), and multivariable MR (MVMR) analyses. Enrichment analysis and protein interaction network were employed to reveal the functional characteristics and biological relevance of potential therapeutic lipid-lowering targets. There was no evidence of causal effects regarding 5 lipid traits and 9 lipid-lowering drug targets on ADs.

FinnGen,38294056,Genetically proxied low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering via PCSK9-inhibitor drug targets and risk of congenital malformations.,"Current guidelines advise against the use of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy. This is based only on previous observational evidence demonstrating an association between statin use and congenital malformations, which is increasingly controversial. In the absence of clinical trial data, we aimed to use drug-target Mendelian randomization to model the potential impact of fetal LDL-lowering, overall and through PCSK9 drug targets, on congenital malformations. Instrumental variants influencing LDL levels overall and through PCSK9-inhibitor drug targets were extracted from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data for LDL on 1 320 016 individuals. Instrumental variants influencing circulating PCSK9 levels (pQTLs) and liver PCSK9 gene expression levels (eQTLs) were extracted, respectively, from a GWAS on 10 186 individuals and from the genotype-tissue expression project. Gene-outcome association data was extracted from the 7th release of GWAS summary data on the FinnGen cohort (n = 342 499) for eight categories of congenital malformations affecting multiple systems. Genetically proxied LDL-lowering through PCSK9 was associated with higher odds of malformations affecting multiple systems [OR 2.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-5.63, P = 0.018], the skin (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.33-3.75, P = 0.007), and the vertebral, anorectal, cardiovascular, tracheo-esophageal, renal, and limb association (VACTERL) (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.16-1.96, P = 0.007). An association was also found with obstructive defects of the renal pelvis and ureter, but this association was suggestive of horizontal pleiotropy. Lower PCSK9 pQTLs were associated with the same congenital malformations. These data provide genetic evidence supporting current manufacturer advice to avoid the use of PCSK9 inhibitors during pregnancy. Using genetic techniques to mimic the effects of PCSK9-inhibitors, a group of lipid-lowering medications, this study provides evidence to support recommendations to avoid the use of these medications in pregnancy due to potential risk of multiple malformations in the newborn.This study provides genetic evidence to support potential associations of PCSK9-inhibitor medications with newborn malformations affecting multiple organ systems, the skin, and a cluster of structural defects simultaneously affecting the spine, anus/rectum, heart, throat, kidneys, arms and legs.There was also weaker evidence of an association of PCSK9-inhibitor medications with newborn malformations resulting in blockages of the kidneys and urine system, though the evidence was less certain for these than for the other malformations.",European journal of preventive cardiology,2024,"Humans; Cholesterol, LDL; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Proprotein Convertase 9; PCSK9 Inhibitors; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Pregnancy; Risk Factors; Abnormalities, Drug-Induced; Biomarkers; Risk Assessment; Serine Proteinase Inhibitors; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Anticholesteremic Agents",False,3
FinnGen,39267096,Identification of potential therapeutic targets for nonischemic cardiomyopathy in European ancestry: an integrated multiomics analysis.,"Nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NISCM) is a clinical challenge with limited therapeutic targets. This study aims to identify promising drug targets for NISCM. We utilized cis-pQTLs from the deCODE study, which includes data from 35,559 Icelanders, and SNPs from the FinnGen study, which includes data from 1,754 NISCM cases and 340,815 controls of Finnish ancestry. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to estimate the causal relationship between circulating plasma protein levels and NISCM risk. Proteins with significant associations underwent false discovery rate (FDR) correction, followed by Bayesian colocalization analysis. The expression of top two proteins, LILRA5 and NELL1, was further analyzed using various NISCM datasets. Descriptions from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) validated protein expression. The impact of environmental exposures on LILRA5 was assessed using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), and molecular docking identified the potential small molecule interactions. MR analysis identified 255 circulating plasma proteins associated with NISCM, with 16 remaining significant after FDR correction. Bayesian colocalization analysis identified LILRA5 and NELL1 as significant, with PP.H4 > 0.8. LILRA5 has a protective effect (OR = 0.758, 95% CI, 0.670-0.857) while NELL1 displays the risk effect (OR = 1.290, 95% CI, 1.199-1.387) in NISCM. Decreased LILRA5 expression was found in NISCM such as diabetic, hypertrophic, dilated, and inflammatory cardiomyopathy, while NELL1 expression increased in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. HPA data indicated high LILRA5 expression in neutrophils, macrophages and endothelial cells within normal heart and limited NELL1 expression. Immune infiltration analysis revealed decreased neutrophil in diabetic cardiomyopathy. CTD analysis identified several small molecules that affect LILRA5 mRNA expression. Among these, Estradiol, Estradiol-3-benzoate, Gadodiamide, Topotecan, and Testosterone were found to stably bind to the LILRA5 protein at the conserved VAL-15 or THR-133 residues in the Ig-like C2 domain. Based on European Ancestry Cohort, this study reveals that LILRA5 and NELL1 are potential therapeutic targets for NISCM, with LILRA5 showing particularly promising prospects in diabetic cardiomyopathy.

FinnGen,39470544,Esophageal cancer risk is influenced by genetically determined blood metabolites.,"It remains unclear what causes esophageal cancer (EC), but blood metabolites have been connected to it. Our study performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causality from genetically proxied 1400 blood metabolites to EC level. A two-sample MR analysis was employed to evaluate the causal relationship between 1400 blood metabolites and EC. Initially, the EC genome-wide association study (GWAS) data (from Jiang L et al) were examined, leading to the identification of certain metabolites. Subsequently, another set of EC GWAS data from FINNGEN was utilized to validate the findings. Causality was primarily determined through inverse variance weighting, with additional support from the MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO models. Heterogeneity was assessed using the MR Cochran Q test. The MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO global methods were employed to detect multicollinearity. In this study, Bonferroni corrected P value was used for significance threshold. We found 2 metabolites with overlaps, which are lipids. Docosatrienoate (22:3n3) was found to be causally associated with a decreased risk of EC, as evidenced by the EC GWAS data (from Jiang et al) (odds ratio [OR] = 0.620, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.390-0.986, P = .044) and the EC GWAS data (from FINNGEN) (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.6-0.99, P = .042), these results were consistent across both data sets. Another overlapping metabolite, glycosyl-N-(2-hydroxyneuramoyl)-sphingosine, was associated with the risk of ES, with EC GWAS data (from Jiang L et al) (OR = 1.536, 95% CI = 1.000-2.360, P = .049), while EC GWAS data (from FINNGEN) (OR = 0.733, 95% CI = 0.574-0.937, P = .013), the 2 data had opposite conclusions. The findings of this study indicate a potential association between lipid metabolites (Docosatrienoate (22:3n3) and glycosyl-N-(2-hydroxynervonoyl)-sphingosine (d18:1/24:1 (2OH))) and the risk of esophageal carcinogenesis.",Medicine,2024,"Humans; Esophageal Neoplasms; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors",False,2
FinnGen,38958660,Is Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Associated with Spinal Degenerative Disorders?: Evidence from Observational and 2-Sample Mendelian Randomization Analyses.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and spinal degenerative disorders (SDD) are common diseases that frequently coexist. However, both traditional observational studies and recent Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have demonstrated conflicting evidence on the association between T2DM and SDD. This comparative study explored and compared the association between T2DM and SDD using observational and MR analyses. For observational analyses, cross-sectional studies (44,972 participants with T2DM and 403,095 participants without T2DM), case-control studies (38,234 participants with SDD and 409,833 participants without SDD), and prospective studies (35,550 participants with T2DM and 392,046 participants without T2DM with follow-up information until 2022) were performed to test the relationship between T2DM and SDD using individual-level data from the U.K. Biobank from 2006 to 2022. For MR analyses, the associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms with SDD susceptibility obtained using participant data from the U.K. Biobank, which had 407,938 participants from 2006 to 2022, and the FinnGen Consortium, which had 227,388 participants from 2017 to 2022, and genetic predisposition to T2DM obtained using summary statistics from a pooled genome-wide association study involving 1,407,282 individuals were examined. The onset and severity of T2DM are not available in the databases being used. Participants with T2DM were more likely to have SDD than their counterparts. Logistic regression analysis identified T2DM as an independent risk factor for SDD, which was confirmed by the Cox proportional hazard model results. However, using single-nucleotide polymorphisms as instruments, the MR analyses demonstrated no causal relationship between T2DM and SDD. The lack of such an association was robust in the sensitivity analysis, and no pleiotropy was seen. Our results suggest that the association between T2DM and SDD may be method-dependent. Researchers and clinicians should be cautious in interpreting the association, especially the causal association, between T2DM and SDD. Our findings provide fresh insights into the association between T2DM and SDD by various analysis methods and guide future research and clinical efforts in the effective prevention and management of T2DM and SDD.

In addition, to assess the causal effect of a specific molecule by employing the obtained GWAS results as genetic epidemiological tools. We applied additional variant quality control to the publicly available GWAS results from the biobanks of the UK (UKBB) and Finland (FinnGen), which comprised 532 cases vs 408 565 controls and 884 cases vs 332 115 controls, respectively. We further meta-analysed these two sets of results. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to test the causal effect of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol on the risk of GCA. The MHC class II region showed significant associations in UKBB, FinnGen and the meta-analysis. The VLDLR region was associated with GCA risk in the meta-analysis. The T allele of rs7044155 increased the expression of VLDLR, decreased the LDL cholesterol level and decreased the disease risk. The subsequent MR results indicated that a 1 s.d. increase in LDL cholesterol was associated with an increased risk of GCA (odds ratio 1.21, 95% CI 1.01-1.45; P = 0.04). Our study identified associations between GCA risk and the MHC class II and VLDLR regions. Moreover, LDL cholesterol was suggested to have a causal effect on the risk of developing GCA.","Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",2024,"Humans; Cholesterol, LDL; Finland; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Giant Cell Arteritis; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, LDL; United Kingdom",False,8

However, the direction causality is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the causality between PBC and CTDs and to promote early screening, pre-emptive therapy, and accurate stratification. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to assess the causal relationship between PBC [Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) meta-analysis, 8021 cases/16498 controls], and SLE (GWAS meta-analysis, 8021 cases/16489 controls), RA(FinnGen, 6236 cases/14727 controls), SS(FinnGen, 2495 cases/365533 controls), SSc (FinnGen, 302 cases/213145 controls). Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the primary analysis method, supplemented by four sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results. The IVW revealed that genetically predicted PBC increased the risk of SLE [odd's ratio (OR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-1.58, P < 0.001]), RA (OR = 1.09, 95%CI1.04-1.14, P<0.001), and SS (OR = 1.18, 95%CI1.12-1.24, P<0.001), but not that of SSc. In addition, no association was observed between CTDs as an exposure and PBC. Sensitivity analyses did not reveal horizontal pleiotropy. Our study provided new genetic evidence for a causal relationship between PBC and CTDs. PBC increased the risk of SLE, RA, and SS.

However, the correlation does not always imply causality. The Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to investigate the causal relationships between THCA and SPMs based on international multicenter data. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to explore potential mechanisms shared by THCA and bladder cancer (BLCA). Summary datasets of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on 30 types of cancers were obtained from the United Kingdom Biobank (UKB) and FinnGen database. Meta-analysis of the UKB and FinnGen results revealed that THCA was significantly positively correlated with BLCA (OR = 1.140; 95% CI, 1.072-1.212; P < 0.001). Four genes, including WNT3, FAM171A2, MLLT11, and ULBP1, were identified as key genes shared by both TCHA and BLCA. Correlation analysis indicated that THCA may increase the risk of secondary BLCA through augmentation of N2 neutrophil infiltration. This study showed that THCA was causally related to BLCA.

FinnGen,38308812,"The epidemiology of pregnancy loss: global burden, variable risk factors, and predictions.","Is the incidence of pregnancy loss correlated with various geographic, socio-demographic, and age stratifications at the societal and national levels, and what are the risk factors associated with pregnancy loss at the individual level? The epidemiological trends and disease burden of pregnancy loss were correlated with various geographic, socio-demographic, and age stratifications, and we identified that poor health condition, smoking, sedentary behaviour, lower educational level, and lower maternal birth weight may significantly increase the risk of pregnancy loss. Several studies have used national, regional, or single-centre data to describe trends in the burden of pregnancy loss, and previous observational studies have identified some variable factors possibly associated with pregnancy loss. However, a comprehensive analysis of global trends and predictions of pregnancy loss are lacking, and the conclusions have been inconsistent. We have utilized the data from Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 to provide an overview of the trends in pregnancy loss in 204 countries and regions worldwide from 1990 to 2019, and have made a forecast for the next 10 years. Moreover, we applied a variety of statistical genetics methods to analyse 34 239 pregnancy loss and 89 340 non-pregnancy loss cases from the FinnGen consortium to comprehensively assess the bidirectional causality of variable factors with pregnancy loss from an individual perspective. We analysed trends in the incidence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and maternal mortality of pregnancy loss at global, regional, national, socio-demographic index (SDI), and age levels. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to predict trends by 2030. Finally, we used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) and multivariate MR (MVMR) analyses to explore the relationship between the pregnancy loss and variables closely related to physical condition, physical activity, lifestyle, sleep conditions, basic conditions. In 2019, there were approximately 42.39 million cases of pregnancy loss worldwide. Globally, the incidence, DALYs, and mortality of pregnancy loss showed a decreasing trend between 1990 and 2019, although the number was increasing in some countries. The age-standardized incidence, DALYs, and mortality rate were negatively correlated with SDI level and show a further decline by 2030. Based on MR analyses, we confirmed that genetically predicted overall health rating (inverse-variance weighted (IVW) odds ratio (OR), 1.68; 95% CI, 1.34-2.13; P = 5.10 × 10-6), smoking initiation (IVW OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.16-1.38; P = 1.90 × 10-9), sedentary behaviour (IVW OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.20-2.01; P = 2.76 × 10-5), educational level (IVW OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.55-0.73; P = 6.56 × 10-10), and maternal birth weight (IVW OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58-0.85; P = 2.98 × 10-4) were significantly related to the risk of pregnancy loss, whereas body mass index (IVW OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17; P = 5.31 × 10-3), alcohol consumption (IVW OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.03-2.95; P = 0.04), insomnia (IVW OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.14-2.42; P = 7.00 × 10-3), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (IVW OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37-0.95; P = 2.85 × 10-2) were suggestively associated with the risk of pregnancy loss. These results were supported by sensitivity and directional analyses. Despite efforts to standardize GBD data from all over the world, uncertainties in data quality control regarding ascertainment of pregnancy loss, medical care accessibility, cultural differences, and socioeconomic status still exist. Furthermore, the population in the MRstudy was limited to Europeans, which means that the results may not be extrapolated to people of other origins. Our study provides for the first time an overview of the epidemiological trends and disease burden of pregnancy loss related with SDI, region, country, and age, and predicts changes in future trends up to 2030. In addition, findings support that genetic susceptibility, smoking, health condition, and sedentary behaviour may be powerful indicators of an increased risk of pregnancy loss. These results would be beneficial for policy makers of different countries and regions to improve prevention implementation.

This study aimed to explore the causal association between urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and CRC risk through a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of ACR (n = 382,500) and CRC (CRC: 6,509 cases and 287,137 controls) were obtained from the IEU OpenGWAS project website and the FinnGen database, respectively. The TwoSampleMR and MR-PRESSO R packages were used to search for and analyze genetic variations that served as instrumental variables for ACR. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using the inverse-variance weighted method, MR-Egger, and weighted median. Genetically predicted ACR was not associated with CRC risk (all P > 0.05). Further analysis based on the site of onset (colon or rectum) also did not show a significant association (all P > 0.05). MR-PRESSO, MR-Egger regression and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis all indicated that the current results were robust and reliable. These findings suggest that ACR does not affect CRC risk and may not be used as a marker of CRC risk in clinical practice.

Several sensitivity analyses, including Cochran's Q, MR-Egger intercept, MR-PRESSO, ""leave-one-out"" test and funnel plot, were used to detect heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. IVW revealed that total and pollen AR were associated with an increased risk of snoring (odds ratio (OR) = 1.011, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.004∼1.019,  AR (specifically AR caused by pollen) might be an independent risk factor for snoring at the genetic level, which should be verified in the future.",American journal of rhinology & allergy,2024,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Snoring; Rhinitis, Allergic; Sleep",False,7
FinnGen,38743124,RFX6 haploinsufficiency predisposes to diabetes through impaired beta cell function.,"Regulatory factor X 6 (RFX6) is crucial for pancreatic endocrine development and differentiation. The RFX6 variant p.His293LeufsTer7 is significantly enriched in the Finnish population, with almost 1:250 individuals as a carrier. Importantly, the FinnGen study indicates a high predisposition for heterozygous carriers to develop type 2 and gestational diabetes. However, the precise mechanism of this predisposition remains unknown. To understand the role of this variant in beta cell development and function, we used CRISPR technology to generate allelic series of pluripotent stem cells. We created two isogenic stem cell models: a human embryonic stem cell model; and a patient-derived stem cell model. Both were differentiated into pancreatic islet lineages (stem-cell-derived islets, SC-islets), followed by implantation in immunocompromised NOD-SCID-Gamma mice. Stem cell models of the homozygous variant RFX6 Our allelic series isogenic SC-islet models represent a powerful tool to elucidate specific aetiologies of diabetes in humans, enabling the sensitive detection of aberrations in both beta cell development and function. We highlight the critical role of RFX6 in augmenting and maintaining the pancreatic progenitor pool, with an endocrine roadblock and increased cell death upon its loss. We demonstrate that RFX6 haploinsufficiency does not affect beta cell number or insulin content but does impair function, predisposing heterozygous carriers of loss-of-function variants to diabetes. Ultra-deep bulk RNA-seq data for pancreatic differentiation stages 3, 5 and 7 of H1 RFX6 genotypes are deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database with accession code GSE234289.

FinnGen,38450701,Genome-Wide Polygenic Score for Muscle Strength Predicts Risk for Common Diseases and Lifespan: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"We used a polygenic score for hand grip strength (PGS HGS) to investigate whether genetic predisposition for higher muscle strength predicts age-related noncommunicable diseases, survival from acute adverse health events, and mortality. This study consisted of 342 443 Finnish biobank participants from FinnGen Data Freeze 10 (53% women) aged 40-108 with combined genotype and health registry data. Associations between PGS HGS and a total of 27 clinical endpoints were explored with linear or Cox regression models. A higher PGS HGS was associated with a reduced risk of selected common noncommunicable diseases and mortality by 2%-10%. The risk for these medical conditions decreased by 5%-23% for participants in the highest PGS HGS quintile compared to those in the lowest PGS HGS quintile. A 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in the PGS HGS predicted a lower body mass index (β = -0.112 kg/m2, standard error [SE] = 0.017, p = 1.69E-11) in women but not in men (β = 0.004 kg/m2, p = .768). PGS HGS was not associated with better survival after acute adverse health events compared to the nondiseased period. The genotype that supports higher muscle strength appears to protect against future health adversities, albeit with modest effect sizes. Further research is needed to investigate whether or how a favorable lifestyle modifies this intrinsic capacity to resist diseases, and if the impacts of lifestyle behavior on health differs due to genetic predisposition for muscle strength.","The journals of gerontology.

The selection of instrumental variables for T2DM was based on two genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses from European cohorts. Summary-level data for PaCa were extracted from the FinnGen and UK Biobank databases. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) and four other robust methods were employed in our MR analysis. Various sensitivity analyses and multivariable MR approaches were also performed to enhance the robustness of our findings. In the IVW and Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) analyses, the odds ratios (ORs) for each 1-unit increase in genetically predicted log odds of T2DM were approximately 1.13 for PaCa. The sensitivity tests and multivariable MR supported the causal link between T2DM and PaCa without pleiotropic effects. Therefore, our analyses suggest a causal relationship between T2DM and PaCa, shedding light on the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of T2DM's impact on PaCa. This finding underscores the importance of T2DM prevention as a strategy to reduce the risk of PaCa.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,"Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Odds Ratio; Risk Factors",False,2

The objective of this study is to investigate the causal relationship between 108 traits and GDM by employing a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to identify potential risk factors of GDM. We conducted MR analyses to explore the relationships between traits and GDM. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for traits were primarily based on data from the UK Biobank (UKBB), while the GWAS for GDM utilized data from FinnGen. We employed a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% to account for multiple comparisons.

Previous GWASs have detected several risk loci for psoriasis. To further improve the understanding of the genetic risk factors impacting the disease, we conducted a discovery GWAS in FinnGen and a subsequent replication and meta-analysis with data from the Estonian Biobank and the UK Biobank; the study sample included 925,649 individuals (22,659 cases and 902,990 controls), the largest sample for psoriasis yet. In addition, we conducted downstream analyses to find out more about psoriasis' cross-trait genetic correlations and causal relationships. We report 6 risk loci, which, to our knowledge, are previously unreported, most of which harbor genes related to NF-κB signaling pathway and overall immunity.

FinnGen,39001774,Effect of Relative Protein Intake on Hypertension and Mediating Role of Physical Fitness and Circulating Fatty Acids: A Mendelian Randomization Study.,"To investigate the causal effect of protein intake on hypertension and the related mediating pathways. Using genome-wide association study summary statistics of European ancestry, we applied univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization to estimate the bidirectional associations of relative protein intake and related metabolomic signatures with hypertension (FinnGen: Ncase=42,857/Ncontrol=162,837; UK Biobank: Ncase=77,723/Ncontrol=330,366) and blood pressure (International Consortium of Blood Pressure: N=757,601) and two-step Mendelian randomization to assess the mediating roles of 40 cardiometabolic factors therein. Mendelian randomization estimates of hypertension from FinnGen and UK Biobank were meta-analyzed without heterogeneity. We performed the study from May 15, 2023, to September 15, 2023. Each 1-SD higher relative protein intake was causally associated with 69% (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.89) lower hypertension risk independent of the effects of other macronutrients, and was the only macronutrient associated with 2.21 (95% CI, 0.52 to 3.91) mm Hg lower pulse pressure, in a unidirectional manner. Higher plant protein-related metabolomic signature (glycine) was associated with lower hypertension risk and pulse pressure, whereas higher animal protein-related metabolomic signatures (leucine, isoleucine, valine, and isovalerylcarnitine [only systolic blood pressure]) were associated with higher hypertension risk, pulse pressure, and systolic blood pressure. The effect of relative protein intake on hypertension was causally mediated by frailty index (mediation proportion, 40.28%), monounsaturated fatty acids (13.81%), saturated fatty acids (11.39%), grip strength (5.34%), standing height (3.99%), and sitting height (3.61%). Higher relative protein intake causally reduces the risk of hypertension, partly mediated by physical fitness and circulating fatty acids.",Mayo Clinic proceedings,2024,Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Hypertension; Dietary Proteins; Genome-Wide Association Study; Fatty Acids; Physical Fitness; Male; Female; Blood Pressure; Middle Aged,False,9
FinnGen,37982563,Genetics of sleep medication purchases suggests causality from sleep problems to psychiatric traits.,"Over 10% of the population in Europe and in the United States use sleep medication to manage sleep problems. Our objective was to elucidate genetic risk factors and clinical correlates that contribute to sleep medication purchase and estimate the comorbid impact of sleep problems. We performed epidemiological analysis for psychiatric diagnoses, and genetic association studies of sleep medication purchase in 797 714 individuals from FinnGen Release 7 (N = 311 892) and from the UK Biobank (N = 485 822). Post-association analyses included genetic correlation, co-localization, Mendelian randomization (MR), and polygenic risk estimation. In a GWAS we identified 27 genetic loci significantly associated with sleep medication, located in genes associated with sleep; AUTS2, CACNA1C, MEIS1, KIRREL3, PAX8, GABRA2, psychiatric traits; CACNA1C, HIST1H2BD, NUDT12. TOPAZ1 and TSNARE1. Co-localization and expression analysis emphasized effects on the KPNA2, GABRA2, and CACNA1C expression in the brain. Sleep medications use was epidemiologically related to psychiatric traits in FinnGen (OR [95% (CI)] = 3.86 [3.78 to 3.94], p < 2 × 10-16), and the association was accentuated by genetic correlation and MR; depression (rg = 0.55 (0.027), p = 2.86 × 10-89, p MR = 4.5 × 10-5), schizophrenia (rg = 0.25 (0.026), p = 2.52 × 10-21, p MR = 2 × 10-4), and anxiety (rg = 0.44 (0.047), p = 2.88 × 10-27, p MR = 8.6 × 10-12).

We performed mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to investigate the causal association of smoking initiation on pain conditions and the potential mediating pathways. Genetic associated with smoking initiation at the genome-wide significance level were selected as instrumental variables. Genetic associations with 10 pain conditions were derived from the FinnGen and UK Biobank study. Multivariable MR analysis was conducted to explore the mediation effects of depression, insomnia and sedentary behavior. A series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the stability of our research findings. Genetic liability to smoking initiation was associated with an increased risk of angina pectoris, dorsalgia, low back pain, pain in limb, pain in joint, pain in thoracic spine and sciatica in both FinnGen and UK Biobank study. These causal associations were largely mediated by major depression (2.9- 39.5%), sedentary behavior (13.0- 31.2%), insomnia (10.3- 33.1%) and combination of all three mediators (30.2- 65.3%). The effects of smoking on outcomes were partly attenuated after adjusting for depression, sedentary behavior and insomnia respectively, and the direct effect of smoking initiation on pain was diminished toward null after adjusting for combined three mediators. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses. Our findings illustrated the causal effect of smoking and a broad range of pain conditions, and major depression, sedentary behavior and insomnia mediate many of these associations.",Scientific reports,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Smoking; Pain; Male; Female; Risk Factors; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sedentary Behavior; Genome-Wide Association Study; United Kingdom; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Genetic Predisposition to Disease",False,9

The development of DR is influenced by metabolic disturbance and genetic factors, including gene polymorphisms. The research aimed to uncover the causal relationships between blood metabolites and DR. The two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to estimate the causality of blood metabolites on DR. The genetic variables for exposure were obtained from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset of 486 blood metabolites, while the genetic predictors for outcomes including all-stage DR (All DR), non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR) were derived from the FinnGen database. The primary analysis employed inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, and supplementary analyses were performed using MR-Egger, weighted median (WM), simple mode and weighted mode methods. Additionally, MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran's  The study identified 13 blood metabolites associated with All DR, 9 blood metabolites associated with NPDR and 12 blood metabolites associated with PDR. In summary, a total of 21 blood metabolites were identified as having potential causal relationships with DR. Additionally, we identified 4 metabolic pathways that are related to DR. The research revealed a number of blood metabolites and metabolic pathways that are causally associated with DR, which holds significant importance for screening and prevention of DR.

Exposure data from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 9724 participants provided information on 46 types of AIR. Outcome data were sourced from a large-scale meta-analysis of female infertility, which included 899 cases and 246,641 controls. Five different Mendelian randomization analysis methods were used to assess the genetic causal relationship between AIR and female infertility, with the inverse variance-weighted method as the primary approach. The robustness of the study results was evaluated through heterogeneity analysis, pleiotropy tests, and leave-one-out validation. Replication and meta-analysis were conducted using FinnGen data to further identify AIR. Through rigorous genetic variant screening, IVW, sensitivity analysis, replication, and meta-analysis, the results indicate that only seropositivity of anti-polyomavirus 2 IgG shows significant evidence of association with female infertility. The reverse MR analysis did not reveal a genetic causal association between female infertility and this antibody-influencing relationship. Sensitivity analysis showed no evidence of pleiotropy or heterogeneity. Replication and meta-analysis using FinnGen data further supported that only anti-polyomavirus 2 IgG seropositivity has a significant association with female infertility. Using Mendelian randomization analysis in two independent samples, this study presents evidence of a genetic association between anti-polyomavirus 2 IgG seropositivity and female infertility.

FinnGen,39062709,Replication of Known and Identification of Novel Associations in Biobank-Scale Datasets: A Survey Using UK Biobank and FinnGen.,"Over the last two decades, numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to unveil the genetic architecture of human complex traits. Despite multiple efforts aimed at the trans-biobank integration of GWAS results, no systematic analysis of the variant-level properties affecting the replication of known associations (or identifying novel ones) in genome-wide meta-analysis has yet been performed using biobank-scale data. To address this issue, we performed a systematic comparison of GWAS summary statistics for 679 complex traits in the UK Biobank (UKB) and FinnGen (FG) cohorts. We identified 37,148 index variants with genome-wide associations with at least one trait in either cohort or in the meta-analysis, only 3528 (9.5%) of which were shared between UKB and FG. Nearly twice as many variants (6577) were replicated in another dataset at the significance level adjusted for the number of variants selected for replication. However, as many as 9230 loci failed to be replicated. Moreover, as many as 5813 loci were observed as significant associations only in meta-analysis results, highlighting the importance of trans-biobank meta-analysis efforts. We showed that variants that failed to replicate in UKB or FG tend to correspond to rare, less pleiotropic variants with lower effect sizes and lower LD score values. Genome-wide associations specific to meta-analysis were also enriched in low-effect variants; however, such variants tended to be more common and have more consistent frequencies between populations. Taken together, our results show a relatively high rate of non-replication of genome-wide associations in the studied cohorts and highlight both widely appreciated and less acknowledged properties of the associations affecting their identification and replication.",Genes,2024,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; UK Biobank; United Kingdom",False,7
FinnGen,38904048,Mendelian randomization unraveled: gender-specific insights into obesity-related phenotypes and colorectal cancer susceptibility.,"Evidence has been increasingly pointing towards a potential link between phenotypes related to obesity and the incidence of colorectal cancer. However, confirming this as a direct causal connection remains elusive. This investigation aims to elucidate the causative links between obesity-associated phenotypes and the incidence of colorectal cancer. Employing the Two Sample Mendelian Randomization (TwoSampleMR) R package, analyses were conducted using Mendelian randomization (MR) to discern potential causative links between obesity categories sourced from both the Institute for Education and University (IEU) Open GWAS Project and Zenodo, and colorectal tumors (data obtained from IEU Open GWAS and FinnGen). For primary evaluations, the study utilized the Wald ratio and the Inverse Variance Weighting (IVW) methods, while the MR-Egger approach was integrated for sensitivity assessment. Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization (Bidirectional MR), as well as Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Score Regression with well-imputed HapMap3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), were additionally executed. Sensitivity assessments entailed IVW, MR-Egger methodologies to assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy, along with a leave-one-out strategy. Instrumental variables were chosen judiciously based on predetermined P-value thresholds and F-statistics. Results from MR evaluations did not identify a clear causative link between BMI and colorectal malignancy. Conversely, both measures of obesity, the Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR) and its adjusted form for BMI (WHRadjBMI), displayed a connection to increased risk of colorectal cancer, especially prominent among female subjects. Reverse MR analyses dismissed potential reverse causality between colorectal malignancies and obesity. A significant genetic interplay was observed between WHR, WHRadjBMI, and colorectal cancer instances. Ensuing MR probes spotlighted inflammatory bowel ailment as a protective factor, while salad intake was indicated as a potential risk concerning colorectal malignancies. Sensitivity reviews, which included tests for both pleiotropy and heterogeneity, validated the robustness of the MR findings. Findings from this research indicate that specific obesity-related parameters, notably WHR and WHRadjBMI, carry a causal relationship with an elevated colorectal cancer risk. The impact is distinctly more evident among females. Such insights might be pivotal for public health deliberations, hinting that individuals boasting a high WHR might necessitate intensified colorectal cancer screenings.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024,"Humans; Colorectal Neoplasms; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Obesity; Female; Male; Phenotype; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genome-Wide Association Study; Sex Factors; Risk Factors",False,0
FinnGen,38703417,Impact of loss-of-function in angiopoietin-like 4 on the human phenome.,"Carriers of the E40K loss-of-function variant in Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), have lower plasma triglyceride levels as well as lower rates of coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). These genetic data suggest ANGPTL4 inhibition as a potential therapeutic target for cardiometabolic diseases. However, it is unknown whether the association between E40K and human diseases is due to linkage disequilibrium confounding. The broader impact of genetic ANGPTL4 inhibition is also unknown, raising uncertainties about the safety and validity of this target. To assess the impact of ANGPLT4 inhibition, we evaluated whether E40K and other loss-of-function variants in ANGPTL4 influenced a wide range of health markers and diseases using 29 publicly available genome-wide association meta-analyses of cardiometabolic traits and diseases, as well as 1589 diseases assessed in electronic health records within FinnGen (n = 309,154). To determine whether these relationships were likely causal, and not driven by other correlated variants, we used the Bayesian fine mapping algorithm CoPheScan. The CoPheScan posterior probability of E40K being the causal variant for triglyceride levels was 99.99 %, validating the E40K to proxy lifelong lower activity of ANGPTL4. The E40K variant was associated with lower risk of CAD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.84, 95 % CI = 0.81 to 0.87, p=3.6e-21) and T2D (OR = 0.91, 95 % CI = 0.87 to 0.95, p=2.8e-05) in GWAS meta-analyses, with results replicated in FinnGen. These significant results were also replicated using other rare loss-of-function variants identified through whole exome sequencing in 488,278 participants of the UK Biobank. Using a Mendelian randomization study design, the E40K variant effect on cardiometabolic diseases was concordant with lipoprotein lipase enhancement (r = 0.82), but not hepatic lipase enhancement (r = -0.10), suggesting that ANGPTL4 effects on cardiometabolic diseases are potentially mainly mediated through lipoprotein lipase. After correction for multiple testing, the E40K variant did not significantly increase the risk of any of the 1589 diseases tested in FinnGen. ANGPTL4 inhibition may represent a potentially safe and effective target for cardiometabolic diseases prevention or treatment.",Atherosclerosis,2024,"Humans; Angiopoietin-Like Protein 4; Phenotype; Genome-Wide Association Study; Loss of Function Mutation; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Triglycerides; Coronary Artery Disease; Bayes Theorem; Risk Factors; Lipoprotein Lipase",False,2

However, the casual association between telomere length (TL) and hyperthyroidism remains unclear. We aim to explore the casual relationship between TL and hyperthyroidism. A two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis employed the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, supplemented by additional approaches such as Weighted Median (WM), and MR Egger. The summary statistics for TL were derived from the UK Biobank, comprising 472,174 individuals, while the data for hyperthyroidism were sourced from the GWAS Catalog and the FinnGen database, encompassing cohorts of 460,499 and 173,938 individuals, respectively. Utilizing 139 genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables (IVs) for TL, forward MR analyses indicated a negative causal effect of TL on hyperthyroidism. The risk of hyperthyroidism decreased as genetically predicted TL increased by one standard deviation, as determined by the IVW form GWAS Catalog (OR:0.659,95%CI: 0.541-0.802,  The finding that longer telomeres reduce hyperthyroidism risk highlights the need to validate hyperthyroidism's impact on telomere length, offering valuable insights for prevention and treatment.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024,"Humans; Hyperthyroidism; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genome-Wide Association Study; Female; Telomere; Telomere Homeostasis; Genetic Predisposition to Disease",False,8
FinnGen,38031296,Effect of Glucosamine on Intraocular Pressure and Risk of Developing Glaucoma.,"Glucosamine supplementation is common but can be associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and could contribute to the pathogenesis of glaucoma. It may be prudent for ophthalmologists to elicit any history of glucosamine use from their patients and advise them accordingly. Further studies on the role of glucosamine in glaucoma are warranted. The most frequently recommended slow-acting medication for osteoarthritis symptoms is glucosamine, although its effectiveness is questionable. Widely used glucosamine sulfate supplements may increase IOP. In the current study, we analyzed online databases such as UK Biobank, MedWatch, and FinnGen to evaluate the relationship between glucosamine and IOP and glaucoma. We included budesonide and fluticasone in the analysis for comparison since these drugs are associated with increased IOP. In UK Biobank subjects, glucosamine use was associated with increased corneal compensated IOP ( P =0.002, 2-tailed t test). This was also true in subjects without glaucoma ( P =0.002, 2-tailed t test). However, no significant association between glucosamine and IOP was detected in subjects with a diagnosis of glaucoma. In MedWatch, 0.21% of subjects taking glucosamine reported glaucoma, 0.29% of subjects using budesonide reported glaucoma, and 0.22% of subjects using fluticasone reported glaucoma. In contrast, 0.08% of subjects using any other drug reported glaucoma. This variability is significant ( P <0.001, 2-tailed Fisher exact test). Data from FinnGen on the risk of primary open angle glaucoma or glaucoma in subjects using glucosamine before the diagnosis of the disease revealed a significantly increased risk for both primary open angle glaucoma (hazard ratio: 2.35) and glaucoma (hazard ratio: 1.95).

Genetic variations in periodontitis and NAFLD were acquired from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using the Gene-Lifestyle Interaction in Dental Endpoints, a large-scale meta-analysis, and FinnGen consortia. Data from the first two databases were used to explore the causal relationship between periodontitis and NAFLD (""discovery stage""), and the data from FinnGen was used to validate our results (""validation stage""). We initially performed MR analysis using 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the discovery samples and 18 in the replicate samples as genetic instruments for periodontitis to investigate the causative impact of periodontitis on NAFLD. We then conducted a reverse MR analysis using 6 SNPs in the discovery samples and 4 in the replicate samples as genetic instruments for NAFLD to assess the causative impact of NAFLD on periodontitis. We further implemented heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses to assess the reliability of the MR results. Periodontitis was not causally related to NAFLD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.036, 95% CI: 0.914-1.175, p = 0.578 in the discovery stage; OR = 1.070, 95% CI: 0.935-1.224, p = 0.327 in the validation stage), and NAFLD was not causally linked with periodontitis (OR = 1.059, 95% CI: 0.916-1.225, p = 0.439 in the discovery stage; OR = 0.993, 95% CI: 0.896-1.102, p = 0.901 in the validation stage). No heterogeneity was observed among the selected SNPs. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the absence of pleiotropy and the reliability of our MR results.

In this investigation, we aimed to quantify the value of genetic information in predicting IDA and Hb-deferral. We analysed genetic data from up to 665,460 participants of the FinnGen, Blood Service Biobank and UK Biobank, and used INTERVAL (N = 39,979) for validation.

We fitted models to estimate the effect sizes of these polygenic risk scores (PRSs) on IDA and Hb-deferral risk while accounting for the individual's age, sex, weight, height, smoking status and blood donation history. Significant variants in GWASs of IDA and Hb-deferral appear to be a small subset of variants associated with ferritin and Hb. Effect sizes of genetic predictors of IDA and Hb-deferral are similar to those of age and weight which are typically used in blood donor management. A total genetic score for Hb-deferral was estimated for each individual.

The putative causal relationships between female reproductive factors and sex hormones with uterine leiomyoma were investigated using two-sample Mendelian randomization. Statistics on exposure-associated genetic variants were obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The uterine leiomyoma GWAS from the FinnGen and FibroGENE consortia were used as outcome data for discovery and replication analyses, respectively. Results were pooled by meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses ensured robustness of the Mendelian randomization analysis. When FinnGen GWAS were used as outcome data, a causal relationship was found between age at menarche (OR 0.84, P < 0.0001), age at menopause (OR 1.08, P < 0.0001), number of live births (OR 0.25, P < 0.001) and total testosterone levels (OR 0.90, P < 0.001) with the risk of uterine leiomyoma. When FibroGENE GWAS were used as outcome data, Mendelian randomization results for age at menopause, the number of live births and total testosterone levels were replicated. In the meta-analysis, a later age at menopause (OR 1.08, P < 0.0001) was associated with an increased risk of uterine leiomyoma. A higher number of live births (OR 0.25, P < 0.0001) and higher total testosterone levels (OR 0.90, P < 0.0001) were associated with a decreased risk of uterine leiomyoma.

FinnGen,39696061,Evaluating causal associations of chronotype with pregnancy and perinatal outcomes and its interactions with insomnia and sleep duration: a mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies suggested chronotype was associated with pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. Whether these associations are causal is unclear. Our aims are to use Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore (1) associations of evening preference with stillbirth, miscarriage, gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, perinatal depression, preterm birth and offspring birthweight; and (2) differences in associations of insomnia and sleep duration with those outcomes between chronotype preferences. We conducted two-sample MR using 105 genetic variants reported in a genome-wide association study (N = 248,100) to instrument for lifelong predisposition to evening- versus morning-preference. We generated variant-outcome associations in European ancestry women from UK Biobank (UKB, N = 176,897), Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 6826), Born in Bradford (BiB, N = 2940) and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa, N = 57,430), and extracted equivalent associations from FinnGen (N = 190,879). We used inverse variance weighted (IVW) as main analysis, with weighted median and MR-Egger as sensitivity analyses. Relying on the individual participant data from UKB, ALSPAC, BiB and MoBa, we also conducted IVW analyses of insomnia and sleep duration on the pregnancy and perinatal outcomes, stratified by genetically predicted chronotypes. In IVW and sensitivity analyses, we did not find robust evidence of associations of chronotype with the outcomes. Insomnia was associated with a higher risk of preterm birth among evening preference women (odds ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval: 1.17, 2.21), but not among morning preference women (odds ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.64, 1.18), with an interaction P-value = 0.01. There was no evidence of interactions between insomnia and chronotype on other outcomes, or between sleep duration and chronotype on any outcomes. This study raises the possibility of a higher risk of preterm birth among women with insomnia who also have an evening preference.

Current understanding about increased risk of IS after VTE remain inconclusive. This study use a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to explore the causality of VTE, pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and IS. This study used pooled data from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS statisics of IS (from EBI database, n = 484 121), VTE (from Finngen database, n = 218 792), PE (from Finngen database, n = 218 413), and DVT (from UK biobank database, n = 337 159) were assessed. Forward and reverse MR analysis were conducted to explore the causal relationship between three type of the exposure (VTE, PE, and DVT) and the outcome (IS). Our primary causal inference method was Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW). Secondary inference methods were Weighted Median and MR-Egger. For the sensitive analysis, MR-PRESSO, MR-Egger intercept, Cochran's Q, leave-one method were used to consolidate our findings.

Immunosuppressive therapy and bone marrow transplantation are effective methods to treat severe aplastic anemia. However, the efficacy is limited by complications and the availability of suitable donors. This study aimed to determine whether any circulating druggable protein levels may have causal effects on AA and provide potential novel drug targets for AA. Genetic variants strongly associated with circulating druggable protein levels to perform Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were used. The effect of these druggable protein levels on AA risk was measured using the summary statistics from a large-scale proteomic genome-wide association study (GWAS) and FinnGen database ( https://www.finngen.fi/en/access_results ). Multivariable MR analyses were performed to statistically adjust for potential confounders, including platelet counts, reticulocyte counts, neutrophil counts, and proportions of hematopoietic stem cells. The data showed that higher level of circulating IFN-γ levels was causally associated with AA susceptibility. The causal effects of circulating IFN-γ levels on the AA were broadly consistent, when adjusted for platelet counts, reticulocyte counts, neutrophil counts and proportions of hematopoietic stem cells.

However, the specific contribution of each factor in the pathogenesis of these diseases are still uncertain. This study employed multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the independent effects of education, intelligence, and cognition on gastrointestinal conditions in the FinnGen and UK Biobank European-ancestry populations. A two-step MR approach was employed to assess the mediating effects of the association. Meta-analysis of MR estimates from FinnGen and UK Biobank showed that 1- SD (4.2 years) higher education was causally associated with lower risks of gastroesophageal reflux (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.66), peptic ulcer (OR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.69), irritable bowel syndrome (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.87), diverticular disease (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.78), cholelithiasis (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.79) and acute pancreatitis (OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.72), independently of intelligence and cognition. These causal associations were mediating by body mass index (3.7-22.3%), waist-to-hip ratio (8.3-11.9%), body fat percentage (4.1-39.8%), fasting insulin (1.4-5.5%) and major depression (6.0-12.4%).

While plasma proteins have been implicated in NAFLD, establishing causal relationships has been challenging due to confounding factors in observational studies. This study aims to explore the causal relationships between plasma proteins and NAFLD using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. We utilized genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from multiple sources to conduct MR analyses. Plasma protein data were obtained from the deCODE open database, and NAFLD data were sourced from the Finnish genetic sample collection (FinnGen). We performed MR analysis to identify plasma proteins causally related to NAFLD and explored the potential mediation effect of antibody-immune responses. Our MR analysis identified three plasma proteins-KNG1, MICB, and PKD2-with significant causal relationships to NAFLD. Mediation analysis further revealed that KNG1 negatively mediated the risk of NAFLD through Epstein-Barr virus EA-D antibody levels, while MICB and PKD2 positively mediated NAFLD risk through the same antibody levels. This study provides novel genetic evidence of causal relationships between specific plasma proteins and NAFLD risk. Measuring the levels of KNG1, MICB, PKD2, and Epstein-Barr virus EA-D antibody levels in patients may help clinicians assess NAFLD risk more accurately.

However, their causal relationship and potential mediators need more evidence to prove. We aimed to investigate the causal relationship between the gut microbiome and MI and the potential mediating role of inflammatory cytokines from a genetic perspective through a Mendelian randomization approach. This study used data from genome-wide association studies of gut microbes (Mibiogen, n = 18, 340), inflammatory cytokines (NFBC1966, FYPCRS, FINRISK 1997 and 2002, n=13, 365), and male infertility (Finngen, n=120, 706) to perform two-way Mendelian randomization (MR), mediated MR, and multivariate MR(MVMR) analyses. In this study, the inverse variance weighting method was used as the primary analysis method, and other methods were used as supplementary analysis methods. In the present study, two gut microbes and two inflammatory cytokines were found to have a potential causal relationship with MI. Of the two gut microorganisms causally associated with male infertility, Anaerotruncus increased the risk of male infertility (odds ratio = 1.81, 95% confidence interval = 1.18-2.77, P = 0.0062), and Bacteroides decreased the risk of male infertility (odds ratio = 0.57, 95% confidence interval = 0.33-0.96, P = 0.0363). In addition, of the two inflammatory cytokines identified, hepatocyte growth factor(HGF) reduced the risk of male infertility (odds ratio = 0.50, 95% confidence interval = 0.35-0.71, P = 0.0001), Monocyte chemotactic protein 3 (MCP-3) increased the risk of male infertility (odds ratio = 1.28, 95% confidence interval = 1.03-1.61, P = 0.0039). Mediated MR analysis showed that HGF mediated the causal effect of Bacteroides on MI (mediated percentage 38.9%). Multivariate MR analyses suggest that HGF may be one of the pathways through which Bacteroides affects MI, with other unexplored pathways. The present study suggests a causal relationship between specific gut microbiota, inflammatory cytokines, and MI.

FinnGen,38795606,Associations between genetically predicted concentrations of circulating inflammatory cytokines and the risk of ten pregnancy-related adverse outcomes: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Evidence from increasing observational studies indicates that systemic inflammation plays a role in pregnancy-related adverse events. However, the causal associations between them are largely unclear. To investigate the potential causal effects of genetically regulated concentrations of inflammatory cytokines on the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, we performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. The cis-protein quantitative trait loci for the 47 inflammatory cytokines derived from the latest genome-wide association studies (GWASs) consisting of 31,112 European individuals were used as the instrumental variables. The latest GWAS summary data for the ten adverse pregnancy events were obtained from the FinnGen project (samples ranging from 141,014 to 190,879). The inverse-variance weighted regression or Ward ratio was used as the primary MR analysis method. Sensitivity analyses based on the other five methods were performed to verify MR results. A replication MR analysis was conducted to further clarify the significant associations using data from the UK Biobank. Twenty-three of the 220 associations were nominally significant (P < 0.05). Among them, seven robust associations survived the Bonferroni correction and passed sensitivity analyses, including positive associations of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM-1) with the risk of excessive vomiting in pregnancy, preeclampsia (PE), and pregnancy hypertension (PH), vascular endothelial growth factor with the risk of medical abortion, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) with the risk of spontaneous abortion (SA), and an inverse association of macrophage inflammatory protein-1α with the risk of medical abortion. The associations of MCSF with SA, and sICAM-1 with both PE and PH were further confirmed in the replication analysis.

We sought to clarify this issue using two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was performed as primary analysis to assess bidirectional causal associations between sleep traits (chronotype, sleep duration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and snoring) and SNHL/SSNHL using publicly available Genome-Wide Association Studies summary data from two large consortia (UK Biobank and FinnGen). Sensitivity analyses, including Mendelian randomization (MR)-Egger, Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier, weight median, Cochran's Q test, leave-one-out analysis, and potential pleiotropy analysis, were conducted to ensure robustness. IVW analysis found suggestive associations of morning chronotype (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-1.16, p = 0.031) and daytime sleepiness (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.24-2.87, p = 0.003) with SNHL onset. Additionally, morning chronotype was nominally associated with SSNHL onset using IVW method (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.10-1.71, p = 0.006). However, there was no evidence for the causal effect of SNHL and SSNHL on different sleep traits (all p > 0.05). Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were stable. Within the MR limitations, morning chronotype and daytime sleepiness were underlying causal contributors to the burden of SNHL, indicating that optimal sleep might facilitate the prevention and development of SNHL. 3 Laryngoscope, 134:4723-4729, 2024.",The Laryngoscope,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Genome-Wide Association Study; Sleep; Snoring",False,8

In this study, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to examine the impact of smoking behaviors (including smoking initiation, age of smoking initiation, cigarettes per day, and smoking cessation) and smoking-related DNA methylation at CpG sites on CHD and MI based on the UK Biobank dataset. Additionally, we included the FinnGen and Biobank Japan datasets as replications and performed a meta-analysis to combine the results from different data sources. We further validated our results using genetic colocalization analysis. In genomic analysis, we provided compelling evidence on the association between genetically predicted smoking initiation and increased susceptibility to CHD and MI. In epigenetic analysis, we identified 11 smoking-related CpG sites linked to CHD risk and 10 smoking-related CpG sites associated with the risk of MI based on the UK Biobank dataset. Subsequently, some of these CpG sites were further replicated using the FinnGen or BBJ datasets. Ultimately, a meta-analysis was conducted to integrate findings from various data sources (3 for CHD, and 2 for MI), revealing that 7 of 11 CpG sites were linked to CHD risk; whereas, 7 of 10 CpG sites were associated with MI risk. Furthermore, we performed genetic colocalization analysis and found that cg19744173 (FBLN7), cg00395063 (ARHGEF12), and cg16822035 (MCF2L) exhibited robust evidence of colocalization with coronary heart disease; whereas, cg19529732 (DIABLO), cg26405020 (FES), and cg08940075 (CNN3) demonstrated strong colocalization evidence with the risk of myocardial infarction.

Several articles have reported a high prevalence of thyroid disease in SSc patients, while one study suggested a potential contribution of appendicitis to the development of SSc. To investigate this causal association, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using instrumental variables (IVs) to assess exposure and outcome. In the MR study involving two cohorts, all analyses were conducted using the TwoSampleMR package in R (version 4.3.0). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) meeting a statistically significant threshold of 5E-08 were included in the analysis. Multiple complementary approaches including MR-IVW, MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode were employed to estimated the relationship between the exposure and outcome. Leave-one-out analysis and scatter plots were utilized for further investigation. Based on the locus-wide significance level, all of the MR analysis consequences manifested no causal association between the risk of appendicitis with SSc (IVW OR 0.319, 95% CI 0.063-14.055, P = 0.966).

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relationship between GERD and SS through a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Independent SNPs associated with GERD and SS were selected from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) as instrumental variables to conduct a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian analysis of GERD and SS. Genetic data were obtained from two databases for the following two outcomes: Gastroesophageal reflux (IEU Open GWAS) [sample size = 602,604 (patients = 129,080; nonpatients = 473,524)] and SS (FinnGen) [sample size = 392,423 (patients = 2,495; nonpatients = 389,928)].

Quality control includes sensitivity analysis, horizontal gene pleiotropy test, heterogeneity test, and MR Steiger directionality test. Our study found that specific gut microbial taxa, such as order Lactobacillales and family Clostridiaceae1, were positively correlated with the occurrence of brain tumors, while genus Defluviitaleaceae UCG011 and genus Flavonifractor were negatively correlated with the occurrence of brain tumors. The Mendelian randomization-Egger intercept test showed that our analysis was not affected by pleiotropy (P>0.05).

FinnGen,39039470,"Multi-omics Mendelian randomization integrating GWAS, eQTL and pQTL data revealed GSTM4 as a potential drug target for migraine.","Migraine, as a complex neurological disease, brings heavy burden to patients and society. Despite the availability of established therapies, existing medications have limited efficacy. Thus, we aimed to find the drug targets that improve the prognosis of migraine. We used Mendelian Randomization (MR) and Summary-data-based MR (SMR) analyses to study possible drug targets of migraine by summary statistics from FinnGen cohorts (nCase = 44,616, nControl = 367,565), with further replication in UK Biobank (nCase = 26,052, nControl = 487,214). Genetic instruments were obtained from eQTLGen and UKB-PPP to verify the drug targets at the gene expression and protein levels. The additional analyses including Bayesian co-localization, the heterogeneity in dependent instruments(HEIDI), Linkage Disequilibrium Score(LDSC), bidirectional MR, multivariate MR(MVMR), heterogeneity test, horizontal pleiotropy test, and Steiger filtering were implemented to consolidate the findings further. Lastly, drug prediction analysis and phenome-wide association study(PheWAS) were employed to imply the possibility of drug targets for future clinical applications. The MR analysis of eQTL data showed that four drug targets (PROCR, GSTM4, SLC4A1, and TNFRSF10A) were significantly associated with migraine risk in both the FinnGen and UK Biobank cohorts. However, only GSTM4 exhibited consistent effect directions across the two outcomes(Discovery cohort: OR(95%CI) = 0.94(0.93-0.96); p = 2.70e - 10; Replication cohort: OR(95%CI) = 0.93(0.91-0.94); p = 4.21e - 17). Furthermore, GSTM4 passed the SMR at p < 0.05 and HEIDI test at p > 0.05 at both the gene expression and protein levels. The protein-level MR analysis revealed a strong correlation between genetically predicted GSTM4 with a lower incidence of migraine and its subtypes(Overall migraine: OR(95%CI) = 0.91(0.87-0.95); p = 6.98e-05; Migraine with aura(MA): OR(95%CI) = 0.90(0.85-0.96); p = 2.54e-03; Migraine without aura(MO): OR(95%CI) = 0.90(0.83-0.96); p = 2.87e-03), indicating a strong co-localization relationship (PPH4 = 0.86).

FinnGen,38211754,"Exploring the causal relationships and mediating factors between depression, anxiety, panic, and atrial fibrillation: A multivariable Mendelian randomization study.","Atrial fibrillation is a significant cardiovascular disease, and the increased risk of its occurrence may be influenced by mental disorders. Currently, the causal relationship between them remains controversial. Our aim is to ascertain the relationship between atrial fibrillation and mental disorders including depression, anxiety, and panic, as well as the risk factors mediating this relationship, through the judgment of genetic susceptibility. We utilized the summarized statistics from nine large-scale genome-wide association studies (in European populations), including depression (PGC, N = 807,553), anxiety (FinnGen, N = 429,209), panic (PGC, N = 230,878), diabetes (UK Biobank, N = 655,666), smoking (IEU, 607,291), hypertension (UK biobank, N = 463,010), obstructive sleep apnea (IEU, N = 476,853), obesity (UK biobank, N = 463,010), and AF (IEU, N = 1,030,836). By applying bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization and multivariable Mendelian randomization to depression, anxiety, panic, and AF, we analyzed their causal relationships and the independent influence of specific risk factors. Furthermore, a two-step MR approach was used to assess the mediating effects of diabetes, smoking, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity. Results from the Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Inverse Variance Weighted Random Effects Model show: the occurrence of genetically predicted depression is related to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) (OR: 1.073; [95 % CI: 1.005-1.146] P < 0.05), and panic is more significantly associated than depression (OR: 1.017; [95 % CI: 1.008-1.027] P < 0.001), while anxiety has no causal relationship with the occurrence of AF (OR: 1.023; [95 % CI: 0.960-1.092], P > 0.05), and AF is not significantly related to the occurrence of depression, anxiety, or panic (P > 0.05). After correcting for the other two risk factors using multivariable Mendelian randomization, depression remains significantly related to the occurrence of AF (β: 0.075; 95 % CI: [0.006, 0.144], P < 0.05), while panic and anxiety are not related to the occurrence of AF. Among them, the risk factors for AF occurrence, hypertension and obesity, are mediators between depression and AF, with mediation proportions of 74.9 % and 14.3 %, respectively. The mediating effects of diabetes, smoking, and obstructive sleep apnea were found to be not statistically significant. The above results are robust after sensitivity analysis. Our results identified that the genetic susceptibility to depression is an independent risk factor for the occurrence of AF, and that hypertension and obesity can mediate this process. Panic also poses some risk to the onset of AF. This demonstrates that controlling hypertension and obesity for emotional management is of great importance in preventing the occurrence of AF.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,"Humans; Atrial Fibrillation; Depression; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mediation Analysis; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Anxiety; Obesity; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Hypertension; Diabetes Mellitus; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8

Across different studies, the reported prevalence of depression in PD varies widely, ranging from 2.7% to 90%, but it is unclear whether this association is due to genetic or acquired factors. Whether there is a causal relationship remains unknown. The aim of this study was to use a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the causal effect of PD on depression. Analyses were conducted separately for individuals of European and East Asian ancestry using publicly available summary data from genome-wide association studies. Depression was divided into two categories: ever depressed for a whole week and major depressive disorder (MDD). PD data were used as the exposure and were obtained from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium and the BioBank Japan PheWeb, while depression data were used as the outcome and were obtained from the ntegrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) Open GWAS Project(A public GWAS database） and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. The influence of PD on depression was assessed using inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, MR-Egger, and weighted mode methods. Heterogeneity and pleiotropy were tested, and the results were validated using FinnGen GWAS data from version R9. In individuals of European ancestry, there was a causal relationship between PD and ever depressed for a whole week (IVW method, odds ratio [OR] = 0.990; 95% CI, 0.984-0.996; p = .002), but no causal relationship was observed between PD and MDD (IVW method, OR = 0.974; 95% CI, 0.942-1.009; p = .141). In individuals of East Asian ancestry, no causal relationship was observed between PD and ever depressed for a whole week (IVW method, OR = 1.001; 95% CI, 0.829-1.209; p = .990) and between PD and MDD (IVW method, OR = 1.017; 95% CI, 0.982-1.052; p = .342). The results of the three additional analysis methods were similar to those of the IVW method, and there was no heterogeneity according to Cochran's Q-test. There was no evidence of pleiotropy based on MR-Egger intercept test and MR-PRESSO. The FinnGen validation dataset supported these findings. The results are stable and reliable. The observed increase in depression among PD patients could potentially be attributed to modifiable acquired factors. Consequently, there is an urgent need to strengthen the management of PD patients in order to prevent the development of depression in the future.",Brain and behavior,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Parkinson Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Depressive Disorder, Major; Asian People; White People; Depression; Genetic Predisposition to Disease",False,1

We conducted a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationship between 77 IgG N-glycosylation traits and various types of pancreatitis, including acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic pancreatitis (CP), alcohol acute pancreatitis (AAP), and alcohol chronic pancreatitis (ACP). This analysis utilized summary-level data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), employing methods such as IVW, MR-Egger, and weighted median. To ensure the robustness of our findings, several sensitivity analyses, including Cochran's Q statistic, leave-one-out, MR-Egger intercept, and MR-PRESSO global test were conducted. Our study uncovered the causal relationship between specific IgG N-glycosylation traits and various types of pancreatitis. Notably, an increase in genetically predicted IGP7 levels was associated with a decreased risk of developing AP. For CP, our data suggested a protective effect associated with higher levels of both IGP7 and IGP31, contrasting with increased levels of IGP27 and IGP65, which were linked to a heightened risk. Moreover, in the case of AAP, elevated IGP31 levels were causatively associated with a lower incidence, while higher IGP26 levels correlated with an increased risk for ACP.

FinnGen,39321259,GNN4DM: a graph neural network-based method to identify overlapping functional disease modules.,"Identifying disease modules within molecular interaction networks is an essential exploratory step in computational biology, offering insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Traditional methods often struggle with the inherent complexity and overlapping nature of biological networks, and they are limited in effectively leveraging the vast amount of available genomic data and biological knowledge. This limitation underscores the need for more effective, automated approaches to integrate these rich data sources. In this work, we propose GNN4DM, a novel graph neural network-based structured model that automates the discovery of overlapping functional disease modules. GNN4DM effectively integrates network topology with genomic data to learn the representations of the genes corresponding to functional modules and align these with known biological pathways for enhanced interpretability.

We found a positive correlation between NAFLD and CRC by IVW method in the forward MR analysis (odds ratio = 1.270, 95% confidence interval: 1.154-1.398, P = 1.092 × 10-6). Inverse MR analysis, however, suggested that CRC may not have a causal effect on NAFLD. Besides, we observed an absence of horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity in this MR analysis. Our forward MR study found that NAFLD may increase CRC risk. In contrast, CRC may not have a causal relationship with NAFLD.

FinnGen,39165512,Mendelian randomization based on immune cells in diabetic nephropathy.,"DKD, a leading cause of chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease, lacks robust immunological research. Recent GWAS utilizing SNPs and CNVs has shed light on immune mechanisms of kidney diseases. However, DKD's immunological basis remains elusive. Our goal is to unravel cause-effect relationships between immune cells and DKD using Mendelian randomization. We analyzed FinnGen data (1032 DKD cases, 451,248 controls) with 731 immunocyte GWAS summaries (MP=32, MFI=389, AC=118, RC=192). We employed forward and reverse Mendelian randomization to explore causal links between immune cell traits and DKD. Sensitivity analysis ensured robustness, heterogeneity checks, and FDR correction minimized false positives. Our study explored the causal link between diabetic nephropathy (DKD) and immunophenotypes using two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) with IVW. Nine immunophenotypes were significantly associated with DKD at p<0.05 after FDR correction. Elevated CD24, CD3 in Treg subsets, CD39+ CD4+, and CD33- HLA DR- AC correlated positively with DKD risk, while CD27 in B cells and SSC-A in CD4+ inversely correlated. Notably, while none showed significant protection, further research on immune cells' role in DKD may provide valuable insights. The results of this study show that the immune cells are closely related to DKD, which may be helpful in the future clinical study.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Diabetic Nephropathies; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Immunophenotyping; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Case-Control Studies; Male",False,2

FinnGen,38128388,Mendelian randomization reveals systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.,"The effect of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on adverse pregnancy outcomes is a controversial topic. This study aimed to use Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causal relationship between SLE, RA and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Genetic variants for SLE and RA, as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes, were derived from pooled statistics from large public genome-wide association studies. Several methods, such as inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median and MR-Pleiotropic Residuals Sum and Outliers, were employed to estimate two-sample causality. Genetic prediction of SLE was associated with higher odds of preterm labour [odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.05; p = 0.008]. RA was associated with higher odds of preterm labour (OR 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.06; p = 0.009), pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07; p = 0.005), and poor fetal growth (OR 1.08, 95 % CI 1.04-1.12; p = 2.91 × 10 This study found a genetic association between SLE and the risk of preterm labour, and highlights the importance of perinatal care and monitoring for patients with SLE. Furthermore, RA was found to be associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes, including preterm labour, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, and poor fetal growth; as such, there is a need for more intensive therapeutic interventions and prenatal monitoring.","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2024,"Humans; Pregnancy; Infant, Newborn; Female; Pregnancy Outcome; Pre-Eclampsia; Eclampsia; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Obstetric Labor, Premature; Fetal Growth Retardation",False,3
FinnGen,38418465,Applying a genetic risk score model to enhance prediction of future multiple sclerosis diagnosis at first presentation with optic neuritis.,"Optic neuritis (ON) is associated with numerous immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, but 50% patients are ultimately diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). Differentiating MS-ON from non-MS-ON acutely is challenging but important; non-MS ON often requires urgent immunosuppression to preserve vision. Using data from the United Kingdom Biobank we showed that combining an MS-genetic risk score (GRS) with demographic risk factors (age, sex) significantly improved MS prediction in undifferentiated ON; one standard deviation of MS-GRS increased the Hazard of MS 1.3-fold (95% confidence interval 1.07-1.55, P < 0.01). Participants stratified into quartiles of predicted risk developed incident MS at rates varying from 4% (95%CI 0.5-7%, lowest risk quartile) to 41% (95%CI 33-49%, highest risk quartile). The model replicated across two cohorts (Geisinger, USA, and FinnGen, Finland).

This two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to investigate the causal relationship between VTE and AF. The VTE dataset were obtained from FinnGen, including 9,176 cases and 209,616 controls. Meanwhile a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 60,620 individuals with AF and 970,216 control subjects identified genetic variations associated with AF. The principal MR analytic approach used in this study is the inverse-variance weighting (IVW) method. Furthermore, we performed complementary MR analyses, including the MR-Egger, Weighted median (WM), and Weighted Mode. MR pleiotropy residual sum was applied to identify pleiotropy. The MR analysis showed suggestive causal associations between VTE and the risk of AF (p = 0.0245, OR [95%CI]: 1.027 [1.003, 1.051]). The reverse MR analysis found that genetic susceptibility to AF was not significantly associated with VTE, as determined by the IVW method (p = 0.7773). The robustness of these findings was corroborated through MR sensitivity analyses. There is a unidirectional causal relationship between VTE and AF, meaning that VTE is a causal risk factor for AF, whereas no effect of AF on VTE was identified.",BMC medical genomics,2024,"Atrial Fibrillation; Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Venous Thromboembolism; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors",False,4

The potential causal relationships between the immunophenotypes and hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) are yet unclear. We conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to thoroughly examine the relationship between immunophenotypes and HDP. The GWAS data on immunological traits was taken from public catalog for 731 immunophenotypes and the summarized GWAS data in 4 types of HDP were retrieved from FinnGen database. The link between immune cell traits and HDP was examined through our study methodology, taking into account both direct relationships and mediation effects of apolipoprotein A (apoA). The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method served as the main analysis, while sensitivity analysis was carried out as a supplement. We identified 14 highly correlative immunophenotypes and 104 suggestive possible factors after investigating genetically predicted immunophenotype biomarkers. According to the IVW analysis, there was a strong correlation between HDP and HLA DR on DC and plasmacytoid DC. Reverse MR analysis showed that there was no statistically significant effect of HDP on immune cells in our investigation. Mediation analysis confirmed that apoA mediates the interaction between HLA DR on DC and HDP. Our results highlight the complex interplay of immunophenotypes, apoA, and HDP. Moreover, the pathophysiological link between HLA DR on DC and HDP was mediated by the level of apoA.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Female; Pregnancy; Genome-Wide Association Study; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Apolipoproteins A; Immunophenotyping; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Biomarkers; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,3
FinnGen,38968531,Intestinal microbiota and tuberculosis: Insights from Mendelian randomization.,"Respiratory tuberculosis (RTB), a global health concern affecting millions of people, has been observationally linked to the gut microbiota, but the depth and nature of this association remain elusive. Despite these findings, the underlying causal relationship is still uncertain. Consequently, we used the Mendelian randomization (MR) method to further investigate this potential causal connection. We sourced data on the gut microbiota from a comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted by the MiBioGen Consortium (7686 cases, and 115,893 controls). For RTB, we procured 2 distinct datasets, labeled the Fingen R9 TBC RESP and Fingen R9 AB1 RESP, from the Finnish Genetic Consortium. To decipher the potential relationship between the gut microbiota and RTB, we employed MR on both datasets. Our primary mode of analysis was the inverse variance weighting (IVW) method. To ensure robustness and mitigate potential confounders, we meticulously evaluated the heterogeneity and potential pleiotropy of the outcomes. In the TBC RESP (RTB1) dataset related to the gut microbiota, the IVW methodology revealed 7 microbial taxa that were significantly associated with RTB. In a parallel vein, the AB1 RESP (RTB2) dataset highlighted 4 microbial taxa with notable links. Notably, Lachnospiraceae UCG010 was consistently identified across both datasets. This correlation was especially evident in the data segments designated Fingen R9 TBC RESP (OR = 1.799, 95% CI = 1.243-2.604) and Finngen R9 AB1 RESP (OR = 2.131, 95% CI = 1.088-4.172).

Despite a certain association between smoking and rosacea being reported by several studies, the actual causality has not been established for the possible bias and confounders. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate a potential causal effect of smoking on rosacea risk. Statistics on smoking and rosacea were obtained from the FinnGen project and Neale Lab Consortium. The causal association was assessed by multiple methods including inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were also conducted to address pleiotropy, along with the leave-one-out method.R version 4.2.3 was applied for the analyses. The IVW estimation revealed that previous smoking has a deleterious effect on rosacea (odds ratio [OR] = 6.7729, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5691-29.2356, p = 0.0104). By contrast, there was no statistically relationship between current smokers and rosacea (OR = 0.6180, 95% CI = 0.0605-6.3094, p = 0.6847). Results were similar in the analysis based on the weighted median method (previous smoking: OR = 8.6297, 95% CI = 1.0131-73.5071, p = 0.0486; current smoking: OR = 0.2896, 95% CI = 0.0106-7.9132, p = 0.4627). The stability of the causal effect estimates was supported by several sensitivity analyses and the leave-one-out method. Our MR study found support forrosacea risk and previous smoking.

It has been suggested that insomnia is related to both the occurrence and progression of PPD. However, because of lingering confounding and bias, it is impossible to determine the cause of this connection using observational analysis. In this study, we evaluate the causal importance of insomnia on postpartum depression using Mendelian randomization (MR). Utilizing summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a two-sample MR study was conducted.

The PPD data were provided by the FinnGen project and comprised 7604 cases and 59,601 controls. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was utilized for the primary MR analysis, with weighted median and MR-Egger as sensitivity analyses. As a result, we found that genetically predicted insomnia was positively associated with postpartum depression. The odds ratios (OR) of PPD were 1.849 (95% (confidence interval) CI 1.011-3.381; p = 0.046).

Two novel rare variant genes (ECE1 and METTL21A) associated with VV were identified, of which METTL21A was associated only with females. The pleiotropic effects of VV-related genes suggested that body size, inflammation, and pulmonary function are strongly associated with the development of VV.

We employed robust genetic instruments for chronic periodontitis as exposure data from the FinnGen database. Data encompassing various pregnancy stage outcomes, including pre-pregnancy conditions (irregular menstruation, endometriosis, abnormal reproductive bleeding, and female infertility), pregnancy complications (hemorrhage, spontaneous miscarriage, and abnormalities in products), and post-pregnancy factors (single spontaneous delivery, labor duration, and birth weight of the child), were obtained from the UK Biobank. The random-effects inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was utilized to compute primary estimates while diligently assessing potential directional pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Our findings indicate a negative association between periodontitis and labor duration (odds ratio [OR] = 0.999; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.999 to 1.000; P = 0.017). Individuals with periodontitis are more likely to deliver lower-weight infants (OR = 0.983; 95% CI: 0.972 to 0.995; P = 0.005). We found no evidence of pleiotropy or heterogeneity in aforementioned two associations. We did not observe casual links with pre-pregnancy conditions and pregnancy complications. This Mendelian Randomization study underscores the genetic influence of periodontitis on specific adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly concerning labor duration and lower birth weight deliveries. Our study emphasizes the critical importance of maintaining periodontal health during pregnancy and offers genetic evidence supporting these associations.

The causal relationship to this question is worth an in-depth comprehensive of known single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with gut microbiota. We conducted bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) utilizing instrumental variables associated with gut microbiota (N = 18,340) from MiBioGen GWAS to assess their impact on PCOS risk in the FinnGen GWAS (27,943 PCOS cases and 162,936 controls). Two-sample MR using inverse variance weighting (IVW) was undertaken, followed by the weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-Egger regression. In a subsample, we replicated our findings using the meta-analysis PCOS consortium (10,074 cases and 103,164 controls) from European ancestry. IVWMR results suggested that six gut microbiota were causally associated with PCOS features. After adjusting BMI, SHBG, fasting insulin, testosterone, and alcohol intake frequency, the effect sizes were significantly reduced. Reverse MR analysis revealed that the effects of PCOS features on 13 gut microbiota no longer remained significant after sensitivity analysis and Bonferroni corrections. MR replication analysis was consistent and the results suggest that gut microbiota was likely not an independent cause of PCOS. Our findings did not support the causal relationships between the gut microbiota and PCOS features at the genetic level.

Investigating the metabolites in serum and cerebrospinal fluid in PTs is essential to understanding the underlying biological mechanisms and identifying new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. We used the GWAS dataset of PTs from the FinnGen database, a dataset of 486 plasma metabolites from the GWAS catalog database, and a dataset of 338 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites from the WADRC and WRAP study collections. An inverse variance weighting (IVW) approach was utilized as the mainly method to investigate causality between metabolites and PTs, supplemented by four complementary methods to strengthen our findings. Additionally, we utilized several sensitivity methods to guarantee the robustness of our findings. The study identified 17 plasma metabolites and 10 CSF metabolites related to PTs. Among these, 11 metabolites indicated a significant positive causality with PTs, while 16 displayed a remarkable negative causality.

However, Mendelian randomization studies have not yet been conducted to explore the causal relationship between them in the context of ovarian cancer. This study conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of 20 amino acids in relation to ovarian cancer data from 2 different sources within the European population, using a two-sample MR approach. The primary results from the inverse variance weighting analysis were then subjected to a meta-analysis, followed by multiple testing correction for the meta-analysis thresholds. Finally, reverse causality testing was performed on the positively associated amino acids and ovarian cancer. MR analyses were conducted for 20 amino acids with ovarian cancer data from both the Finngen R10 and Open genome-wide association study databases. The inverse variance weighted results from these 2 analyses were then combined through meta-analysis, with multiple corrections applied to the significance thresholds of the meta-analysis results. The findings showed that only cysteine had a significant association with ovarian cancer, with an (odds ratio) odds ratio value of 0.507 (95% confidence interval: 0.335-0.767, P = .025). The P-value of the combined MR and meta-analysis, after multiple testing correction, was 0.025, indicating statistical significance (P < .05).

FinnGen,39325819,Polygenic scores for complex traits are associated with changes in concentration of circulating lipid species.,"Understanding perturbations in circulating lipid levels that often occur years or decades before clinical symptoms may enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and provide novel intervention opportunities. Here, we assessed if polygenic scores (PGSs) for complex traits could detect lipid dysfunctions related to the traits and provide new biological insights. We constructed genome-wide PGSs (approximately 1 million genetic variants) for 50 complex traits in 7,169 Finnish individuals with routine clinical lipid profiles and lipidomics measurements (179 lipid species). We identified 678 associations (P < 9.0 × 10-5) involving 26 traits and 142 lipids. Most of these associations were also validated with the actual phenotype measurements where available (89.5% of 181 associations where the trait was available), suggesting that these associations represent early signs of physiological changes of the traits. We detected many known relationships (e.g., PGS for body mass index (BMI) and lysophospholipids, PGS for type 2 diabetes and triacyglycerols) and those that suggested potential target for prevention strategies (e.g., PGS for venous thromboembolism and arachidonic acid). We also found association of PGS for favorable adiposity with increased sphingomyelins levels, suggesting a probable role of sphingomyelins in increased risk for certain disease, e.g., venous thromboembolism as reported previously, in favorable adiposity despite its favorable metabolic effect. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of lipidomic alterations in genetic predisposition for a wide range of complex traits.

FinnGen,38351510,Causality Assessment Between Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies and Lung Cancer: A Bidirectional 2-Sample Mendelian Randomization.,"Although observational studies have revealed associations between idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) and lung cancer (LC), they have not established a causal relationship between these 2 conditions. We used a 2-sample Mendelian randomization approach to examine the bidirectional causal associations between IIMs and LC, using single-nucleotide polymorphisms selected from high-quality genome-wide association studies in the FinnGen database. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess potential heterogeneity and pleiotropy impacts on the Mendelian randomization results. Our analysis demonstrated a positive causal effect of genetically increased IIM risk on LC (odds ratio, 1.114; 95% confidence interval, 1.057-1.173; p = 5.63 × 10 -5 ), particularly on the lung squamous cell carcinoma subtype (odds ratio, 1.168, 95% confidence interval, 1.049-1.300, p = 0.00451), but not on lung adenocarcinoma or small cell lung cancer. No causal effect of LC on IIMs was identified. Sensitivity analyses indicated that horizontal pleiotropy was unlikely to influence causality, and leave-one-out analysis confirmed that the observed associations were not driven by a single-nucleotide polymorphism. Our findings offer compelling evidence of a positive causal relationship between IIMs and LC, particularly with regard to lung squamous cell carcinoma, in the European population. Conversely, there is no evidence of LC causing IIMs. We recommend that LC diagnosis consider the specific characteristics of IIMs.",Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Lung Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Myositis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Causality",False,1
FinnGen,39488097,Bidirectional association between abnormal cardiac conditions and epilepsy: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies have consistently indicated a significant correlation between abnormal cardiac conditions and epilepsy. However, the association and direction of this relationship remain a subject of debate. This study employs a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the association between abnormal cardiac conditions and epilepsy. Instrumental variables, represented by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with epilepsy and various abnormal cardiac conditions, were derived from large-scale genome-wide association studies databases, including FinnGen and UK Biobank. Bidirectional MR analysis was conducted to estimate the association between epilepsy and abnormal cardiac conditions. Sensitivity analyses were performed using MR-Egger, weighted median, Inverse Variance Weighted, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier methods. The forward MR analysis suggested a potential positive effect of atrial fibrillation and flutter (AF) and valvular heart diseases (VHD) on the risk of epilepsy. Conversely, the reverse MR analysis indicated that epilepsy might increase the susceptibility to AF, VHD, and heart failure. The findings support a bidirectional relationship between AF, VHD, and epilepsy, indicating that AF and VHD can elevate the risk of developing epilepsy, while epilepsy, in turn, can also increase the risk of developing AF and VHD. Furthermore, the study suggest that epilepsy may contribute to the development of heart failure. These results underscore the importance of screening for cardiac abnormalities in patients with epilepsy and vice versa, to better understand their clinical significance and potential as modifiable risk factors.",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2024,"Humans; Epilepsy; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Heart Diseases; Genetic Predisposition to Disease",False,2

To assess this potential relationship, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using independent genetic variants for UA levels from a published genome-wide association study (GWAS). Summary statistics for instrument-outcome associations from FinnGen database for AA and AD. Various sensitivity analyses were performed using different MR methods including random effects inverse variance weighting, fix effects inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger, weighted median/mode, and the contamination mixture method. Genetically predicted UA levels was associated with a higher AA risk (odds ratio (OR), 1.223; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.058-1.388; p = 0.017) in a simple size of 209,366 individuals. No association was found between uric acid levels and the risk of AD (OR,0.812; 95 % CI, 0.423-1.200; p = 0.293). Our study suggests a significant and robust causal association between UA levels and risk of AA but did not support such a relationship between UA levels and AD risk, which might be interpreted with caution and further confirmed. These findings support a clinically relevant causal effect of serum urate levels on the risk of AA.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2024,Humans; Aortic Aneurysm; Aortic Dissection; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Uric Acid,False,8
FinnGen,39809179,Evidence from Mendelian randomization analysis combined with meta-analysis for the causal validation of the relationship between 91 inflammatory factors and lumbar disc herniation.,"Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common spinal disease. In recent years, an increasing number of observational studies have reported the impact of inflammatory factors on LDH. By conducting Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis on 91 inflammatory factors, it is possible to reveal their causal relationship with LDH, providing new insights for prevention and treatment strategies. In this study, a two-sample MR analysis was performed, using 91 inflammatory factors as exposure data, and LDH data from 2 different sources as outcome data. Subsequently, the most significant results from the inverse-variance weighted analysis were subjected to meta-analysis, with multiple corrections applied to the thresholds to ensure result accuracy. Finally, reverse causality MR analysis was conducted to validate the causal relationship between the identified positive inflammatory factors and LDH. Ninety-one cytokines were analyzed in relation to LDH using MR with data from the Finngen and UK Biobank databases. The inverse-variance weighted results from both analyses were then meta-analyzed, and multiple corrections were applied to the significance threshold of the meta-analysis results. Ultimately, only 1 cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-beta levels (genome-wide association study ID: GCST90274840), showed a significant association after the combined MR analysis and multiple corrections, with an odds ratio of 1.073 (95% confidence interval: 1.034-1.113, P = .0154). Furthermore, this positive cytokine did not display any reverse causality with LDH from either data source.

However, causality is still confused. Our research aims to explore the relationship between RAS and NOMAP through a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and to explore whether RAS can serve as a risk factor for NOMAP to provide a reference for the clinical strategy. An exposure dataset for RAS were collected from a published study based on the UK Biobank (UKB). Outcome datasets included Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics of NOMAP from the FinnGen datasets. The core method was inverse variance weighting (IVW). The Bonferroni correction, MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, Cochcan's Q test, MR-PRESSO, and leave-one-out methods served as complementary methods. We found no significant evidence of causal relationships between RAS and NOMAP. After applying the Bonferroni correction, the corrected P was equal to 0.00625 (0.05/1/8). The IVW method provided the sole evidence for RAS on Benign neoplasm of floor of mouth (BNFM) (OR = 2.509, 95% CI: 1.296-4.857, P = 0.006), but the subsequent MR-Egger regression method showed that this result may be due to horizontal pleiotropy (P = 0.035). The Cochran Q-test, MR-Egger regression, and MR-PRESSO did not reveal any heterogeneity or directional pleiotropy for the other outcomes. In conclusion, this is the first MR analysis to investigate the relationship between RAS and NOMAP. Our research confirmed at the genetic level that no causal association has been identified between RAS and NOMAP, therefore facilitating a logical therapeutic perspective and the development of clinical therapies for them.",BMC cancer,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Stomatitis, Aphthous; Mouth Neoplasms; Genome-Wide Association Study; Pharyngeal Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Predisposition to Disease",False,2
FinnGen,39497807,Genetically mimicked effects of thyroid dysfunction on diabetic retinopathy risk: a 2-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization study.,"Thyroid dysfunction exhibits a heightened prevalence among people with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. Furthermore, TD emerges as a notable correlated risk factor for the onset of diabetic retinopathy. Using data from the FinnGen database (R9), we investigated the causal relationship between thyroid dysfunction (TD) and four stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR). A two-sample univariable Mendelian randomization (UVMR) approach was employed to estimate the total causal effect of TD on four stages of DR, while multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) was used to assess the direct causal effect. The meta-analysis was conducted to summarize the collective effect of TD on four stages of DR. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was the primary approach for Mendelian randomization analysis, with heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and leave-one-out sensitivity analyses performed to validate the robustness of the findings. In UVMR analysis, thyrotoxicosis (TOS) was significantly associated with an increased risk of diabetic retinopathy across four stages (OR, 1.10-1.19; P<0.025). However, MVMR analysis, after adjusting for Graves' disease (GD) and/or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), revealed no significant association between TOS and the four stages of diabetic retinopathy. The Meta-analysis demonstrated the collective effect of TOS on diabetic retinopathy across all stages [OR=1.11; 95% CI (1.08-1.15); P<0.01]. In UVMR analysis, the estimates for hypothyroidism (HPT) and GD were similar to those for TOS. In the MVMR analysis, after adjusting for RA, the significant effect of HPT on DR and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) remained. Additionally, MVMR analysis suggested that the estimates for GD on DR were not affected by TOS, except for GD-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). However, no significant correlation persisted after adjusting for RA, including for GD-PDR.

FinnGen,39403374,"Potential causal relationships between blood metabolites, inflammatory cytokines, and venous thromboembolism.","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the abnormal coagulation of blood in deep veins, which impairs venous return and includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The incidence of VTE is increasing, leading to severe complications and sequelae. Despite the widespread application of multi-omics analyses in vascular disease research, identifying the specific links between various metabolic products, cytokines, and VTE, as well as their potential mediating roles, requires further validation due to confounding factors. Summary statistics for 1,091 metabolites, 309 metabolite ratios (8,299 individuals), and 41 inflammatory cytokines (8,293 individuals) were obtained from the largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Summary statistics for VTE (21,021 cases, 391,160 controls), DVT (6,501 cases, 357,111 controls), and PE (10,046 cases, 401,128 controls) were derived from the FinnGen R10 dataset. We initially examined causal relationships using two-sample MR analysis, followed by Two-step Mendelian Randomization (TSMR) and Multivariable Mendelian Randomization (MVMR) to identify potential mediating mechanisms. We identified causal associations for 78 blood metabolites with VTE, 79 with DVT, and 81 with PE. Among all 41 inflammatory cytokines included, only platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) levels showed a causal relationship with increased risks of VTE, DVT, and PE. MVMR analysis revealed that the associations between glycocholate levels and VTE, DVT, and PE were mediated by PDGF-BB, accounting for 14.54% (p=2.84E-04), 17.10% (p=3.64E-05), and 10.44% (p=1.39E-02), respectively. Furthermore, the associations between dodecanedioate (C12:1-DC) levels and VTE and DVT were also mediated by PDGF-BB, accounting for 12.79% (p=6.10E-04) and 12.17% (p=2.13E-04), respectively.

However, few studies have offered causal evidence of lipid species beyond these standard lipids. We conducted an analysis using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset comprising 179 lipid species, including 13 types across four major categories, to identify instrumental variables (IVs) associated with plasma lipids. We utilized two GWAS datasets from the IEU and Finngen for psoriasis vulgaris as the outcome. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to explore the causal relationship between 179 lipid species and psoriasis vulgaris in two datasets. Lipid species showing causal association in both psoriasis datasets were compared for overlap. Our study identified potential causal relationships between six lipid species and psoriasis vulgaris: phosphatidylcholine (16:1_18:2), phosphatidylcholine (18:0_18:2), phosphatidylcholine (18:1_20:4), phosphatidylethanolamine (16:0_18:2), phosphatidylinositol (18:0_20:3), and triacylglycerol (50:1).

This study aims to assess the causal association between immune cells and CVDs. A total of 731 immune cells were derived from a previously published genome-wide association study (GWAS), which included approximately 22 million genetic variants among 3,757 individuals of Sardinian ancestry. Genetic associations with atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction and stroke were extracted from large-scale GWAS. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to assess the causal association between immune cells and CVDs. Replication MR analysis based on FinnGen dataset and meta-analysis are sequentially conducted to validate causal relationships. Collectively, genetically predicted 4 immune cell traits were associated with AF and 5 immune cell traits were associated with stroke. Increased levels of IgD- CD38dim absolute count were associated with a higher susceptibility to AF, while increased expression of CD14+ CD16+ monocytes, CD62L on CD62L+ myeloid dendritic cells, and CD16 on CD14- CD16+ monocytes were linked to a decreased susceptibility to AF. Additionally, an elevated susceptibility to stroke was linked to an increase in the percentage of CD39+ resting Tregs and heightened CD27 expression on IgD- CD38+ cells. Conversely, a decreased susceptibility to stroke was associated with increased CD40 expression on monocytes, particularly on CD14+ CD16+ and CD14+ CD16- monocytes, with the latter two showing the most compelling evidence.

In addition, the heterogeneity and pleiotropy of the results were assessed by Cochran's Q test and MR-Egger regression. Basing on IVW method, genetically predicted serum iron level, ferritin and transferrin had negative effects on anxiety disorders. The odd ratios (OR) of anxiety disorders per 1 standard deviation (SD) unit increment in iron status biomarkers were 0.922 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.862-0.986; p = 0.018) for serum iron level, 0.873 (95% CI 0.790-0.964; p = 0.008) for log-transformed ferritin and 0.917 (95% CI 0.867-0.969; p = 0.002) for transferrin saturation.

FinnGen,39350373,Evaluating the Causal Effect of Type 2 Diabetes on Alzheimer's Disease Using Large-Scale Genetic Data.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a high comorbidity with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, there is still some controversy over whether T2D has a causal impact on AD at present. We aimed to reveal whether T2D has a causal effect on AD using large-scale genetic data. Firstly, we performed a primary two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the potential causal effects of T2D on AD. For this analysis, we used the largest available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) T2D (T2D1, including 80,154 cases and 853,816 controls) and AD (AD1, including 111,326 cases and 677,663 controls) datasets. Additionally, we performed a validation MR analysis using two largely overlapping-sample datasets from FinnGen, including T2D (T2D2, including 57,698 cases and 308,252 controls) and AD (AD2, including 13,393 cases and 363,884 controls). In all MR analyses, the inverse variance-weighted method was used as the primary analysis method, supplemented by the weighted-median and MR-Egger techniques. In the primary analysis, we found that T2D was not associated with the risk of AD (OR: 0.98, CI: 0.95-1.01, P=0.241). Similarly, no significant association was detected in the validation MR analysis (OR: 0.97, CI: 0.64-1.47, P=0.884). Our findings provide robust evidence that T2D does not have a causal impact on AD. Future studies need to further explore the effect of T2D on the non-AD components of the dementia phenotype.",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,2024,"Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,4
FinnGen,39312328,Bidirectional Mendelian randomization explores the causal relationship between dietary habits and rheumatoid arthritis.,"Epidemiological and other studies have shown that the occurrence and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are closely related to diet. To further explore the causal association between dietary habits and RA, we performed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. The dataset related to dietary habits is from genome-wide association studies, including 143 dietary habits. The dataset of RA is from the FinnGen database. Inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, simple mode, weighted median, and weighted mode were used for the 2-sample, 2-way MR analysis. At the same time, a variety of pleiotropic and heterogeneity tests were used to ensure the accuracy of the results. IVW results show that among current drinkers (drinks usually with meals yes + it varies vs no) was positively correlated with RA (β, 0.563 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.286-0.840]; P = 6.7 × 10-5). Spread type (low fat spread vs any other) was negatively correlated with RA (β, -2.536 [95% CI, -3.725 to -1.346]; P = 2.9 × 10-5). In addition, the reverse MR results showed that RA was positively correlated with milk type (skimmed vs any other; β, 0.006 [95% CI, 0.000-0.011]; P = 4.5 × 10-2). RA was positively correlated with spread type (tub margarine vs never; β, 0.016 [95% CI, 0.002-0.029]; P = 2.5 × 10-2). The results of pleiotropy and heterogeneity tests showed that there was no pleiotropy (P > .05) in the obtained results. The analysis results of MR-Egger, simple mode, weighted median, and weighted mode are consistent with our IVW results. This study reveals a potential association between specific dietary habits and RA. Among current drinkers (drinks usually with meals yes + it varies vs no) was positively correlated with RA. Spread type (low fat spread vs any other) was negatively correlated with RA. RA was positively correlated with milk type (skimmed vs any other) and spread type (tub margarine vs never).",Medicine,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Feeding Behavior; Genome-Wide Association Study; Diet; Milk",False,8

We aimed to evaluate the causal effects of PBC on SRDs through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data were obtained from MRC IEU OpenGWAS and FinnGen databases. Independent genetic variants for PBC were selected as instrumental variables. Inverse variance weighted was used as the main approach to evaluate the causal effects of PBC on Sjögren syndrome (SS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and polymyositis (PM). Horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity were measured by MR‒Egger intercept test and Cochran's Q value, respectively. PBC had causal effects on SS (OR = 1.177, P = 8.02e-09), RA (OR = 1.071, P = 9.80e-04), SLE (OR = 1.447, P = 1.04e-09), SSc (OR = 1.399, P = 2.52e-04), MCTD (OR = 1.306, P = 4.92e-14), and PM (OR = 1.416, P = 1.16e-04). Based on the MR‒Egger intercept tests, horizontal pleiotropy was absent (all P values > 0.05). The robustness of our results was further enhanced by the leave-one-out method.

FinnGen,39119343,Unraveling the causal link: fatty acids and inflammatory bowel disease.,"Previous observational studies have revealed the strong relationship between fatty acids (FA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nonetheless, due to the inherent limitations of retrospective research, the causality between the two has not been clearly established. Genetic variants associated with the 17 FA indicators were derived from genome-wide association studies. Summary statistics for the discovery cohort and testing cohort for IBD, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), were available from IIBDGC and FinnGen, respectively. Bidirectional MR analysis and sensitivity analysis with multiple measures were applied to comprehensively investigate the causal link between FA and IBD. Combining the results of various MR methods, the validation of testing cohort, and the merging of meta-analysis, we demonstrated that genetically predicted Omega-3 FA levels, Ratio of Omega-3 FA to total FA, Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels, and Ratio of DHA to total FA reduced the risk of IBD, UC, and CD. Meanwhile, multivariate MR suggested that the risk effects of Omega-3 FA and DHA for UC and CD were mainly affected by Saturated FA and Monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA). Furthermore, although there was the causal association between Ratio of MUFA to total FA as well as Ratio of Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to MUFA and CD, sensitivity analysis prompted that the findings were not robust. None of the above results had a reverse causal effect. This MR investigation provided evidence of causality between diverse FA and IBD.

Although several observational studies assessing this relationship have reported an inverse association between CCT and POAG, this could be the result of collider bias. In this study, we leveraged human genetic data to assess through Mendelian randomisation (MR) the effect of CCT on POAG risk and whether this effect is mediated by intraocular pressure (IOP) changes. We used 24 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CCT (p value<5×10 MR analysis suggested a positive association between CCT and POAG (OR of POAG per 50 µm increase in CCT: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.18 to 1.61; p value<0.01). MR mediation analysis showed that 28.4% of the total effect of CCT on POAG risk was mediated through changes in IOP. The primary results were consistent with estimates of pleiotropy-robust MR methods.

This study aims to explore the potential causal relationship between dietary nutrients and T2D. Causal estimation utilized Mendelian randomization techniques. Single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to dietary nutrients were identified from existing genome-wide association studies and used as instrumental variables. Genome-wide association studies data pertinent to T2D were sourced from the DIMANTE consortium and the FinnGen database. Techniques including inverse variance weighting (IVW), weighted mode, weighted median, and Mendelian randomization-Egger were employed for causal inference, complemented by sensitivity analysis. Genetically predicted higher phenylalanine (IVW: odds ratio = 1.10 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.17, P = 1.5 × 10-3, q_pval = 3.4 × 10-2) and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (IVW: odds ratio = 1.001 95% confidence interval 1.0006-1.003, P = 3.7 × 10-3, q_pval = 4.1 × 10-2) levels were directly associated with T2D risk. Conversely, no causal relationships between other nutrients and T2D were established. We hypothesize that phenylalanine and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid contribute to the pathogenesis of T2D. Clinically, the use of foods with high phenylalanine content may pose potential risks for patients with a heightened risk of T2D.

Nevertheless, whether it is the use of digital devices that alters suicide risk or suicide risk manifests itself through change digital device use needs to be further explored. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to explore potential causal relationships in the perspective of genetic prediction. We collected publicly available digital device use and suicide risk summary statistics genome-wide association data from UK Biobank, Neale Lab and FinnGen genetic databases. We used inverse variance weighting methods to assess MR estimates. For robustness of the results, we performed further tests of heterogeneity and pleiotropy. In the Phase 1 results, we did not observe any effect of the length of digital device use on the suicide risk, while the results of Phase 2 suggested a significant positive association between suicide risk and the length of mobile phone use (IVW OR, 1.04; 95%CI, 1.01-1.06; P = 0.002), but this significance disappeared after adjusting for confounders of mental and affective disorders.

There is also a lack of theoretical basis for the application of the gut microbiota in the treatment of pyogenic arthritis. In our study, we utilized the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the MiBioGen Consortium involving 13,400 participants and extracted summary statistical data of the microbiota metabolic pathways of 7,738 participants of European descent from the Dutch Microbiome Project (DMP) The data of pyogenic arthritis were derived from the FinnGen R10 database, including 1,086 patients and 147,221 controls. We employed the two-sample Mendelian randomization approach to investigate the causal association between the gut microbiota and pyogenic arthritis. Our methods comprised inverse variance weighting, Mendelian Randomization Egger regression, weighted median, and weighted modal methods. Subsequently, polygenic and heterogeneity analyses were conducted. At the class level, β-proteobacteria is positively correlated with the risk of pyogenic arthritis. At the order level, Burkholderia is positively associated with the disease. At the genus level, the unclassified genus of Sutterellaceae is positively correlated with the disease, while the unnamed genus of Lachnospiraceae, Rothia, and the unnamed genus of Erysipelotrichaceae are negatively correlated with the disease. In addition, Faecalibacterium and Finegoldia are also negatively correlated with the disease. Sensitivity analysis did not show any abnormal evidence. This study indicates that β-proteobacteria, Burkholderiales, and the unclassified genus of Sutterellaceae are associated with an increased risk of the disease, while the unnamed genus of Lachnospiraceae, Rothia, the unnamed genus of Erysipelotrichaceae, Faecalibacterium, and Finegoldia are related to a reduced risk.

A variety of gastrointestinal disorders (GDs) have been accounted to be related to CAD. Thus, this study aims to determine their causal relationship by two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relevant to 22 GDs were employed as instrumental variables from the genome-wide association summary (GWAS) datasets. Genetic associations with CAD and HF were acquired from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and other GWAS studies. We conducted a univariable MR (UVMR) analysis followed by a meta-analysis. A multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was then performed with smoking and body mass index (BMI) as justifications. Also, a bi-directional MR analysis was leveraged to verify the reverse causal correlations. Generally, UVMR analyses separately observed the causal effects of GDs on CAD and HF. Genetic liability to gastroesophageal reflux disease displayed a positive association with both CAD (OR=1.19; 95%CI: 1.01-1.41) and HF (OR=1.22; 95%CI: 1.00-1.49) risk; genetic liability to celiac disease separately attributed to CAD (OR=1.02; 95%CI: 1.01-1.03) and HF (OR=1.01; 95%CI: 1.00-1.02), which also maintained after MVMR analysis. Besides, we observed mutually causal associations between CAD and celiac disease.

Inflammatory factors and plasma metabolites are important in assessing its progression. However, the causal relationship between them and OSA remains unclear, hampering early clinical diagnosis and treatment decisions. We conducted a large-scale study using data from the FinnGen database, with 43,901 cases and 366,484 controls for our discovery MR analysis. We employed 91 plasma proteins from 11 cohorts (totaling 14,824 participants of European descent) as instrumental variables (IVs). Additionally, we conducted a GWAS involving 13,818 cases and 463,035 controls to replicate the MR analysis. We primarily used the IVW method, supplemented by MR Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode methods. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize MR findings, followed by tests for heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and sensitivity analysis (LOO). Reverse MR analysis was also performed to explore causal relationships. The meta-analysis showed a correlation between elevated Eotaxin levels and an increased risk of OSA (OR=1.050, 95% CI: 1.008-1.096; p < 0.05). Furthermore, we found that the increased risk of OSA could be attributed to reduced levels of X-11849 and X-24978 (decreases of 7.1% and 8.4%, respectively).

Associations of anxiety and incident KSD were assessed in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHENES) using multivariate logistic regression. Two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization studies and a two-step two-sample MR was used to estimate the mediating factors that influence KSD risk. Examinations of NHANES data revealed that a rise in the frequency and intensity of anxiety were independently associated with incident KSD. In MR analysis, anxiety (uk-a-51 and uk-b-6519) were from the UK Biobank, with sample sizes of 328,717 and 450,765 respectively. KSD data were from the FinnGen, including 8597 cases and 333,128 controls. In the IVW analysis, genetically predicted anxieties (ukb-a-51 and ukb-b-6519) were found to be causally associated with a higher risk of KSD, with odds ratios of 6.18 (95 % CI 2.54-15.04) and 3.44 (95 % CI 1.67-7.08), respectively. There were no reverse causal effects. Further mediation analysis indicated that anxiety increases the risk of KSD by raising eGFR, through which 11.8 % of the effect of anxiety on KSD risk was mediated. The research was confined to individuals of European heritage, and there could be specific genetic variances among diverse ethnicities.

Neuroticism affects PPD, which remains controversial for confounding factors and reverse causality in cross-sectional research. Therefore, mendelian randomization (MR) study has been adopted to investigate their causal relationship. This study utilized large-scale genome-wide association study genetic pooled data from three major databases: the United Kingdom Biobank, the European Bioinformatics Institute, and the FinnGen databases. The causal analysis methods used inverse variance weighting (IVW). The weighted median, MR-Egger method, MR-PRESSO test, and the leave-one-out sensitivity test have been used to examine the results' robustness, heterogeneity, and horizontal pleiotropy. The fixed effect model yielded the results of meta-analysis. In the IVW model, a meta-analysis of the MR study showed that neuroticism increased the risk of PPD (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.11-1.25, p < 0.01). Reverse analysis showed that PPD could not genetically predict neuroticism. There was no significant heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy bias in this result.

FinnGen,38572516,Identification of prospective aging drug targets via Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Aging represents a multifaceted process culminating in the deterioration of biological functions. Despite the introduction of numerous anti-aging strategies, their therapeutic outcomes have often been less than optimal. Consequently, discovering new targets to mitigate aging effects is of critical importance. We applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to identify potential pharmacological targets against aging, drawing upon summary statistics from both the Decode and FinnGen cohorts, with further validation in an additional cohort. To address potential reverse causality, bidirectional MR analysis with Steiger filtering was utilized. Additionally, Bayesian co-localization and phenotype scanning were implemented to investigate previous associations between genetic variants and traits. Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis was conducted to assess the impact of genetic variants on aging via their effects on protein expression. Additionally, mediation analysis was orchestrated to uncover potential intermediaries in these associations. Finally, we probed the systemic implications of drug-target protein expression across diverse indications by MR-PheWas analysis. Utilizing a Bonferroni-corrected threshold, our MR examination identified 10 protein-aging associations. Within this cohort of proteins, MST1, LCT, GMPR2, PSMB4, ECM1, EFEMP1, and ISLR2 appear to exacerbate aging risks, while MAX, B3GNT8, and USP8 may exert protective influences. None of these proteins displayed reverse causality except EFEMP1. Bayesian co-localization inferred shared variants between aging and proteins such as B3GNT8 (rs11670143), ECM1 (rs61819393), and others listed. Mediator analysis pinpointed 1,5-anhydroglucitol as a partial intermediary in the influence LCT exhibits on telomere length.

Hence, rigorous and further investigations in this domain hold significant clinical relevance for the development of novel potential immunotherapeutic targets. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using the tools available in the ""TwoSampleMR"" R package. The GWAS data for these 731 immune traits were sourced from the GWAS Catalog database. Concurrently, data on gastrointestinal tract cancers, encompassing malignant tumors in the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, and rectum, were extracted from the FinnGen database. The immune traits subjected to MR analysis predominantly fall into four categories: median fluorescence intensities (MFI), relative cell (RC), absolute cell (AC), and morphological parameters (MP). To ensure the reliability of our findings, sensitivity analyses were implemented to address robustness, account for heterogeneity, and alleviate the impact of horizontal pleiotropy. A total of 78 immune traits causally linked to gastrointestinal tract cancers were identified, encompassing esophageal cancer (12 traits), gastric cancer (13 traits), small intestine cancer (22 traits), colon cancer (12 traits), and rectal cancer (19 traits). Additionally, 60 immune traits were recognized as protective factors associated with gastrointestinal tract cancers, distributed across esophageal cancer (14 traits), gastric cancer (16 traits), small intestine cancer (7 traits), colon cancer (14 traits), and rectal cancer (9 traits). Furthermore, it was observed that seven immune traits are causally related to gastrointestinal tract cancers in at least two locations.

Some dietary components are known to be associated with inflammation. However, there is currently limited research on the relationship between dietary inflammatory potential and the risk of IBS. A total of 129,408 participants in the UK Biobank were included in this study. Energy-Adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII) based on 26 nutrients and the Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern (EDIP) based on 17 food groups were constructed, and on the basis of the tertiles, the continuous score was categorized into proinflammatory, neutral, and antiinflammatory categories. Associations between IBS and E-DII and EDIP were investigated by multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Potential confounders including sociodemographic, lifestyle, body mass index (BMI), psychological state, type 2 diabetes, and thyroiditis were adjusted. In addition, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were also performed. Finally, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to explore the independent causality of nutrients and dietary-derived serum antioxidants with IBS. In the cohort study, over a median follow-up period of 13.26 years, 2421(1.87%) participants developed IBS. In the E-DII categories, after adjusting for the confounders, individuals in the proinflammatory diet category had a higher risk of IBS compared with the antiinflammatory category (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03-1.28, p = 0.015, p trend = 0.017) and neutral category (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.26, p = 0.030, p trend = 0.017). In the EDIP categories, after adjusting for the confounders, individuals in the proinflammatory diet category had a higher risk of IBS compared with antiinflammatory category (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.33, p = 0.002, p trend = 0.002) but no significant association compared with neutral category (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99-1.23, p = 0.067, p trend = 0.002). In the MR analysis, genetically determined intake levels of 16 nutrients and 6 dietary sources of circulating antioxidants did not have a causal effect on IBS.

Multivariable MR analysis confirmed that SCZ effects on these outcomes were independent of HI. The effect of SCZ genetic liability on mental and physical health may not be strongly affected by socioeconomic differences. This suggests that SCZ-specific strategies are needed to reduce negative health outcomes affecting patients and high-risk individuals.",Schizophrenia bulletin,2024,Humans; Schizophrenia; Income; Female; Comorbidity; Genome-Wide Association Study; Health Status; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Mendelian Randomization Analysis,False,9
FinnGen,38740536,Genetically predicted biomarkers of iron homeostasis and risk of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: A mendelian randomization study.,"Both iron overload and iron deficiency have been associated with cardiovascular diseases in observational studies. Previous Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies discovered a protective effect of higher iron status on coronary atrial disease, while a neutral effect on all-cause heart failure. Using two-sample MR, we evaluated how genetically predicted systemic iron status affects the risk of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and different phenotypes. Two-sample MR analyses were performed to estimate the causal effect of four biomarkers of systemic iron status on diagnosed cardiomyopathy and its subtypes in 242,607 participants from the FinnGen research project. The level of transferrin saturation was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiomyopathy (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.13-1.38) when using nine separately selected genetic instruments. An increase in genetically determined serum iron (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation [SD], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.38) and ferritin (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.02-2.18) were associated with an increased risk of cardiomyopathy. Total iron binding capacity, a marker of reduced iron status, was inversely linked with cardiomyopathy (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65-0.98). The risk effect of iron status was more evident in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and related heart failure. These analyses support the causal effect of increased systemic iron status on a higher risk of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. A screening test for cardiomyopathy should be considered in patients with evidence of iron overload. Future study is needed for exploring the mechanism of these causal variants on cardiomyopathy.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Iron; Cardiomyopathies; Risk Assessment; Transferrin; Phenotype; Risk Factors; Ferritins; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Male; Biomarkers; Female; Homeostasis; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Aged; Iron Overload",False,0

However, making causal inferences is difficult due to the methodological constraints of observational studies. In this study, we used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to examine the causal relationship between PM 2.5 and the risk of CVD. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) statistics for PM2.5 and CVD were collected from the FinnGen and UK Biobanks. Mendelian randomization analyses were applied to explore the causal effects of PM2.5 on CVD by selecting single-nucleotide polymorphisms(SNP) as instrumental variables. The results revealed that a causal effect was observed between PM2.5 and coronary artery disease(IVW: OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.35, 3.14), and hypertension(IVW: OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03, 1.12). On the contrary, no causal effect was observed between PM2.5 and myocardial infarction(IVW: OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.44, 1.22), heart failure(IVW: OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.96, 2.47), atrial fibrillation(IVW: OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71, 1.48), and ischemic stroke (IS)(IVW: OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.54, 1.77).

FinnGen,38297958,Causal relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and erythema nodosum: A two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"Previous studies have demonstrated the coexistence of erythema nodosum (EN) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), while the exact etiology of the co-occurrence of the two disorders remains uncertain. A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design was employed to determine the causal link between EN and IBD. Genetic variations associated with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were derived from accessible genome-wide association studies pertaining to European ancestry. The FinnGen database was used to find the genetic variations containing EN. In the forward model, IBD was identified as the exposure, whereas in the reverse model, EN was identified as the exposure. The causal link between IBD and EN was examined using a range of different analysis techniques, the primary one being the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, including inverse variance weighted-fixed effects (IVW-FE) and inverse-variance weighted-multiplicative random effects (IVW-MRE). To strengthen the results, assessments of sensitivity, heterogeneity, and pleiotropy were also conducted. MR results showed that IBD increased the risk of EN (IVW-MRE: OR = 1.242, 95% CI = 1.068-1.443, p = 0.005). Furthermore, there was a strong correlation found between CD and a higher risk of EN (IVW-FE: OR = 1.250, 95% CI = 1.119-1.396, p = 8.036 × 10 The current investigation found that in European populations, IBD and its subtype CD could raise the incidence of EN.",Skin research and technology : official journal of International Society for Bioengineering and the Skin (ISBS) [and] International Society for Digital Imaging of Skin (ISDIS) [and] International Society for Skin Imaging (ISSI),2024,"Humans; Erythema Nodosum; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Databases, Factual",False,5
FinnGen,38220361,Assessing the journey of calcium supplementation: A mendelian randomization study on the causal link between calcium levels and sleep disorders.,"Sleep disorder is a growing concern, and calcium supplementation is often recommended as a potential intervention for sleep disorders. However, the causal relationship between calcium levels and the incidence of sleep disorders remains unclear. Mendelian randomization techniques utilizing genetic variants that affect calcium levels, can provide valuable insights into causality. This study aims to examine the association between calcium levels and sleep disorders in a diverse population that includes both adolescents and adults, and investigate the effects of calcium levels on sleep disorders. Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted using data from UK Biobank and FinnGen datasets. The inverse-variance weighting (IVW) was selected as the primary method. In addition, traditional mediation analysis was performed on a subset of the NHANES data spanning from 2007 to 2018. Our findings provide evidence supporting a causal relationship between calcium intake and reduced risk of sleep disorders (beta = -0.079, SE = 0.0395, P = 0.0457). While not reaching statistical significance, other MR methods such as weighted median and Mr-Egger exhibited similar directional trends. Analysis of the NHANES cohort revealed a negative association between calcium levels and the prevalence of sleep disorders in male, black, and physically active populations. However, this association was not observed in other demographic groups. Our results suggested that there is no significant correlation between calcium levels and sleep disorder in non-exercise populations.

FinnGen,38828408,Identification of cytokines in benign and malignant thymus tumors: based on Mendelian randomization and proteomics.,"The aim of this study was to identify potential causal cytokines in thymic malignancies and benign tumors from the FinnGen database using Mendelian randomization (MR). In this study, data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 91 cytokines were used as exposure factors, and those of thymic malignant tumors and thymic benign tumors were the outcome variables. Two methods were used to determine the causal relationship between exposure factors and outcome variables: inverse variance weighting (IVW) and MR-Egger regression. Sensitivity analysis was performed using three methods, namely, the heterogeneity test, the pleiotropy test, and the leave-one-out test. There was a causal relationship between the expression of fibroblast growth factor 5, which is a risk factor for thymic malignant tumors, and thymic malignant tumors. C-C motif chemokine 19 expression, T-cell surface glycoprotein CD5 levels, and interleukin-12 subunit beta levels were causally related to thymic malignant tumors and were protective. Adenosine deaminase levels, interleukin-10 receptor subunit beta expression, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand levels, and TNF-related activation-induced cytokine levels showed a causal relationship with thymic benign tumors, which are its risk factors. Caspase 8 levels, C-C motif chemokine 28 levels, interleukin-12 subunit beta levels, latency-associated peptide transforming growth factor beta 1 levels, and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 expression showed a causal relationship with thymic benign tumors, which are protective factors.

This study aims to investigate the causal relationship between Vitamin D levels and bronchiectasis using a 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Data from 2 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on European ancestry were analyzed: serum vitamin D levels (sample size = 441,291 [UK Biobank]) and bronchiectasis (sample size = 187,830 [cases = 1107, controls = 186,723; FinnGen]). Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) analysis was primarily used to assess the causal effect of 25(OH)D levels on bronchiectasis, supplemented by Mendelian randomization Egger regression (MR-Egger), weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode analyses. Additionally, MR-Egger intercept test and MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier methods were implemented to determine pleiotropy, and Cochran's Q test was conducted for heterogeneity testing. Leave-one-out analysis and Bayesian weighted Mendelian randomization was also used to assess the robustness of the results. The MR analysis suggested no significant causal effects of serum 25(OH)D levels on bronchiectasis using the IVW method (odds ratio = 1.550; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.908-2.315; P = .120). These results were consistent across MR-Egger regression, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode analyses. No significant heterogeneity, pleiotropy, or bias was detected in instrumental variables. Additionally, no evidence supported the causal effects of bronchiectasis on serum vitamin D levels (β = -0.002, 95% CI: -0.007 to 0.003; P = .463).

FinnGen,39565405,"Relationship between immune cell traits, circulating inflammatory cytokines, and the risk of incisional hernia after gastric surgery.","The systemic and local inflammatory response in patients after surgical operation is closely related to the quality of the wound healing. Low-quality wound healing and defects in the suture technique lead to the occurrence of incisional hernia (IH). However, the causal relationship between human circulating inflammatory cytokines, immune cell traits, and the risk of IH remains unclear. We used summary data from genome-wide association studies to assess the causal relationship between 91 types of circulating inflammatory factors, 731 types of circulating immune cell traits, and the risk of IH. The outcome dataset was obtained from FinnGen, including 6,336 patients with IH and 232,612 controls. We performed Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to identify their causal relationship and immune cell phenotypes upstream of inflammatory factors. Inverse variance weighting is considered to be the main analysis method. Among the identified cytokines, TNF-related activation-induced cytokine levels were associated with a lower risk of IH (OR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.82-0.96; P = 0.003). In contrast, interleukin-5 levels were associated with an increased risk of IH (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.06-1.31; P = 0.003). Additionally, a significant causal relationship was found between four immune cell traits and the risk of IH (P < 0.01). Through two-step MR analysis, we determined that interleukin-5 levels mediate the causal relationship between the relative count of CD25hi % CD4 + in Treg cells and the higher risk of IH. This study found a causal relationship between specific inflammatory cytokines, immune cell traits, and risk of IH.

FinnGen,39387050,Utilize proteomic analysis to identify potential therapeutic targets for combating sepsis and sepsis-related death.,"Sepsis is an inflammatory disease that leads to severe mortality, highlighting the urgent need to identify new therapeutic strategies for sepsis. Proteomic research serves as a primary source for drug target identification. We employed proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR), genetic correlation analysis, and colocalization analysis to identify potential targets for sepsis and sepsis-related death. Genetic data for plasma proteomics were obtained from 35,559 Icelandic individuals and an initial MR analysis was conducted using 13,531 sepsis cases from the FinnGen R10 cohort to identify associations between plasma proteins and sepsis. Subsequently, significant proteins underwent genetic correlation analysis, followed by replication in 54,306 participants from the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project and validation in 11,643 sepsis cases from the UK Biobank. The identified proteins were then subjected to colocalization analysis, enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction network analysis. Additionally, we also investigated a MR analysis using plasma proteins on 1,896 sepsis cases with 28-day mortality from the UK Biobank. After FDR correction, MR analysis results showed a significant causal relationship between 113 plasma proteins and sepsis. Genetic correlation analysis revealed that only 8 proteins had genetic correlations with sepsis. In the UKB-PPP replication analysis, only 4 proteins were found to be closely associated with sepsis, while validation in the UK Biobank sepsis cases found overlaps for 21 proteins. In total, 30 proteins were identified in the aforementioned analyses, and colocalization analysis revealed that only 2 of these proteins were closely associated with sepsis. Additionally, in the 28-day mortality MR analysis of sepsis, we also found that only 2 proteins were significant. The identified plasma proteins and their associated metabolic pathways have enhanced our understanding of the complex relationship between proteins and sepsis.

However, the genetic pathophysiology remains under investigation. Through multi-omics Mendelian Randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses, we identified mitochondrial-related genes causally linked with T2DM and its complications. Summary-level quantitative trait loci data at methylation, RNA, and protein levels were retrieved from European cohort studies. GWAS summary statistics for T2DM and its complications were collected from the DIAGRAM and FinnGen consortiums, respectively. Summary-data-based MR was utilized to estimate the causal effects. The heterogeneity in dependent instrument test assessed horizontal pleiotropy, while colocalization analysis determined whether genes and diseases share the same causal variant. Enrichment analysis, drug target analysis, and phenome-wide MR were conducted to further explore the biological functions, potential drugs, and causal associations with other diseases. Integrating evidence from multi-omics, we identified 18 causal mitochondrial-related genes. Enrichment analysis revealed they were not only related to nutrient metabolisms but also to the processes like mitophagy, autophagy, and apoptosis. Among these genes, Tu translation elongation factor mitochondrial ( This study identified 18 mitochondrial-related genes causally associated with T2DM at multi-omics levels, enhancing the understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction in T2DM and its complications.

Therefore, we conducted a Mendelian Randomization (MR) mediation analysis to elucidate the mediating role of POAG in the association between IOP and RVO. We identified 47 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with IOP (P-value < 5 × 10 MR analyses showed that higher IOP is associated with higher RVO risk (odds ratio of RVO per 1 mmHg increase in IOP: 1.53; 95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 2.26; p-value = 0.03). Moreover, our MR mediation analysis suggested that 91.6% of the total effect of IOP on RVO risk was mediated through POAG. The primary results were consistent with estimates of pleiotropy-robust MR methods. Our findings suggest that higher IOP increases the risk of RVO and that the majority of this effect is mediated through POAG.","Eye (London, England)",2024,"Humans; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Intraocular Pressure; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Retinal Vein Occlusion; Genome-Wide Association Study; Risk Factors; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Mediation Analysis; Aged; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; United Kingdom",False,9

However, currently available treatment strategies that target cytokines have failed. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the interplay between genetically predicted circulating concentrations of cytokines and the outcomes of sepsis and to identify potential targets for sepsis treatment. Data related to 35 circulating cytokines in 31,112 individuals (including 11,643 patients with sepsis) were included in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) from the UK Biobank and FinnGen consortia. A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to evaluate the causal effects of circulating cytokines on sepsis outcomes and other cytokines. A total of 35 inflammatory cytokine genes were identified in the GWASs, and 11 cytokines, including Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP1α), IL-16, et al., were associated with sepsis outcome pairs according to the selection criteria of the cis-pQTL instrument. Multiple MR methods verified that genetically predicted high circulating levels of IL-1ra or MIP1α were negatively correlated with genetic susceptibility to risk of sepsis, including sepsis (28-day mortality), septicaemia, streptococcal and pneumonia-derived septicaemia (P ≤ 0.01).

To address this gap, we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to comprehensively explore the causal relationship between BMR and IVDD. BMR data were obtained from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) database, while IVDD data were derived from the FinnGen project. The causal relationship between IVDD and BMR was investigated using MR, with inverse-variance weighting (IVW) as the primary estimate. MR-Egger weighed median and weighed mode were employed for robustness. Sensitivity analyses, including the Cochran Q test, leave-one-out analysis, and MR-Egger intercept analysis, were conducted. Furthermore, the study also identified causal relationships between IVDD and factors associated with BMR (hyperthyroidism, type 2 diabetes, standing height, weight, and body mass index). Multivariable MR was applied to further assess the direct effect of BMR on IVDD. Genetic predisposition to BMR (after removing outliers OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.37-1.63; P = 5.073e-21) were associated with an increased risk of IVDD. Additionally, IVDD risk increased with greater height, weight, and BMI. No causal relationship was observed between hy/thy and T2D and intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) (P > 0.05). In multivariable MR, a significant causal association between BMR and IVDD persisted, even after adjusting for BMI, height, and weight. In this study, we successfully identified that a higher BMR is independently and causally linked to IVDD, indicating an increased risk of developing IVDD.

This research applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess whether lipids and statin medication are associated with an increased risk of SNHL. A two-sample MR was used in this study. Genetic instruments were constructed from variants associated with risk factors. Data for lipids and statin medication were obtained from the IEU OpenGWAS project, and for SNHL from the Finngen research project, which comprises 32,487 individuals with SNHL and 331,736 control individuals. Genetically predicted higher levels of triglycerides were associated with an increased risk of SNHL. The use of genetically predicted atorvastatin was associated with a lower risk of SNHL. Rosuvastatin has demonstrated potential in treating SNHL, yet further investigations are warranted to elucidate its relationship with SNHL. Insufficient evidence was available to suggest that the genetically predicted level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or the use of simvastatin were associated with SNHL. The study provides genetic evidence suggesting that increased levels of triglycerides in the blood could be a risk factor for SNHL and that the use of certain statin medications, including atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, could reduce the risk of SNHL.

Firstly, we selected eight respiratory diseases Genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets mainly from the FinnGen collaboration as outcomes. The exposure was based on GWAS statistics about the gut microbiome, sourced from the MiBioGen consortium, including gut microbial taxa. The causal link between the gut microbiome and respiratory illnesses was then estimated using a Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, including the inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, MR-Egger, simple mode, and weighted mode. To ensure reliability, F-statistics and sensitivity tests were conducted. Furthermore, we performed a reverse MR analysis of the pre-Mendelian positive findings to possible reverse causality.

FinnGen,39421746,The causality between rheumatoid arthritis and postural deformities: bidirectional Mendelian randomization study and mediation analysis.,"To better understand the preventive or therapeutic clinical interventions that may be supported by the association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and postural deformities including hallux valgus, flat foot, and scoliosis, this study was conducted using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. It aimed to investigate whether RA is causally associated with postural deformities in European populations. Summary-level data on RA and postural deformities were obtained from the IEU OpenGWAS project and Finngen database, respectively. LDSC regression analysis was conducted to assess the genetic correlation between these diseases. The inverse variance weighting (IVW) method was employed as the primary approach for two-sample MR analyses to evaluate causality. Supplementary methods included MR-Egger, maximum likelihood, weighted median, and cML-MA. To test for potential horizontal pleiotropy, we performed the MR-Egger intercept test, cML-MA, and secondary analyses after excluding confounders. Additionally, mediation analyses were conducted using two-step MR. The IVW method revealed RA to be causally associated with hallux valgus (OR 1.132, 95% CI 1.087-1.178, P < 0.001) and flat foot (OR 1.197, 95% CI 1.110-1.291,  These findings indicate a potential causal association between genetically predicted RA and both hallux valgus and flat foot. Furthermore, hallux valgus serves as a mediator in the pathway from RA to flat foot. This underscores the importance of early screening and preventive treatment of foot deformities in RA patients. Further research is necessary to determine the applicability of these findings in non-European populations.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,"Humans; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Scoliosis; Hallux Valgus; Mediation Analysis; Flatfoot; Genetic Predisposition to Disease",False,8
FinnGen,37980884,Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and Rhinosinusitis: A Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Comorbidities, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), are common in patients with rhinosinusitis (RS). However, the link between RS and GERD has not been fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between GERD and acute (ARS) or chronic RS (CRS), providing references for the pathogenesis and management of RS. The data were obtained from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit Open GWAS project and FinnGen. A total of 972,838 individuals were included. The inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method was applied to obtain the primary results of the study. Weighted median, MR-Egger, and mode-based methods were used to determine the robustness of the results. Cochran's Q statistic and MR-Egger method were applied to detect heterogeneity and pleiotrophy in instrumental variables (IVs). Other sensitivity analyses included MR-PRESSO and leave-one-out analysis. The MR study showed that GERD was associated with an increased risk of CRS (OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.18-1.57, p &lt; 0.001). The results of other analysis methods were broadly consistent with the IVW estimate. No heterogeneity was detected by Cochran's Q test (p = 0.061) and MR-PRESSO (p = 0.074). No horizontal pleiotropy was shown in IVs (p = 0.700). GERD was also associated with an increased risk of ARS (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.17-1.48, p &lt; 0.001). Some analytical results were inconsistent with the IVW estimate. No heterogeneity and pleiotropy were observed. There was no sufficient evidence for a reverse causal effect of RS on GERD. Our study supported that GERD promoted the risk of CRS and may be a potential risk factor for ARS. This provides additional support for further investigation into the mechanisms of GERD on RS.",International archives of allergy and immunology,2024,Humans; Rhinosinusitis; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Risk Factors; Genome-Wide Association Study,False,2
FinnGen,39533571,Causal relationship between leukocyte telomere length and two cardiomyopathies based on a bidirectional Mendelian randomization approach.,"This study aims to employ the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the relationship between leukocyte telomere length (TL) and 2 prevalent forms of cardiomyopathies. Using R software (4.3.1) for MR study, independent genetic variants associated with leukocyte TL were extracted from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit database, while cardiomyopathies data were pooled from FinnGen and European Bioinformatics Institute databases. Analytical methodologies included inverse-variance weighting, MR-Egger regression, and weighted median methods. Further analyses involved MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO for handling horizontal pleiotropy and Cochran Q test for study heterogeneity. Our forward Mendelian randomization study indicates a positive correlation between longer leukocyte TL and the risk of 2 forms of cardiomyopathies: the longer the leukocyte telomere, the higher is the risk of cardiomyopathies. Specifically, for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy the OR is 2.23 (95% CI: 1.19-4.14, P = .01), for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the OR is 1.80 (95% CI: 1.14-2.85, P = .01), and for dilated cardiomyopathy the OR is 1.32 (95% CI: 1.01-1.71, P = .04). In contrast, our reverse Mendelian randomization showed that cardiomyopathies were not directly associated with TL, and the inverse-variance-weighted test was not statistically significant for any of the 3 (P > .05). The reliability tests for the forward Mendelian randomization, including both MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO tests, show no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy, and Cochran Q test indicates no heterogeneity. The ""leave-one-out"" sensitivity analysis revealed no outlier genes. The reliability tests for the reverse Mendelian randomization, including both MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO tests, also indicate no genetic pleiotropy. Despite the heterogeneity shown in our study between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and leukocyte TL, the sensitivity analysis did not identify any anomalies. Our Mendelian randomization study suggests that longer leukocyte TL is associated with an increased risk of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the onset of these 2 kinds of disease does not directly lead to changes in leukocyte TL.",Medicine,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Leukocytes; Telomere; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated; Cardiomyopathies; Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease",False,8

Despite numerous studies on GERD, the causal relationships between blood/urine metabolites and GERD remain unclear. This study aims to explore the causal relationships between GERD and 35 blood/urine metabolites. In this study, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses for 35 blood/urine metabolites with GERD phenotypes from the FinnGen R10 and UKB databases separately. We then performed a meta-analysis of the inverse variance weighted results from the 2 MR analyses and applied multiple corrections to the significant P values from the meta-analysis. Finally, we conducted reverse causality validation for the corrected positive blood/urine metabolite phenotypes with GERD. After conducting MR analysis combined with meta-analysis and performing multiple corrections, we found significant positive causal associations between only 3 blood/urine metabolites and GERD, with no significant reverse associations. Among them, 2 are risk factors for the occurrence of GERD: alanine aminotransferase levels (odds ratio (OR) = 1.120, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.064-1.180, P = .0005) and urate levels (OR = 1.095, 95% CI = 1.044-1.147, P = .005). Additionally, sex hormone-binding globulin levels are protective against GERD (OR = 0.928, 95% CI = 0.896-0.961, P = .0009). Elevated levels of the metabolites alanine aminotransferase and urate are associated with an increased risk of GERD, identifying them as risk factors for the condition. In contrast, higher levels of SHBG are linked to a decreased risk of GERD, indicating that SHBG is a protective factor against the disease.",Medicine,2024,Humans; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Uric Acid; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin; Risk Factors; Alanine Transaminase; Biomarkers; Phenotype,False,8

Mendelian randomization was applied to elucidate the causal role of serum lipids in AD and assess the therapeutic potential of lipid-lowering drug targets. Genetic variants related to serum lipid traits and lipid-lowering drug targets were sourced from the Global Lipid Genetics Consortium GWAS data. Comprehensive AD data were collated from the UK Biobank, FinnGen, and Biobank Japan. Colocalization, Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR), and mediation analyses were utilized to validate the results and pinpoint potential mediators. Among assessed targets, only Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) was significantly linked to a reduced AD risk, corroborated across three separate AD cohorts. No association between serum lipid concentrations or other lipid-lowering drug targets and diminished AD risk was observed. Mediation analysis revealed that beta nerve growth factor (b-NGF) might mediate approximately 12.8% of PCSK9's influence on AD susceptibility. Our findings refute dyslipidemia's role in AD pathogenesis.

However, there have been limited studies utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the connection between immune cells and CC. This study is to investigate the causal effects of immune traits on CC and non-neoplastic conditions of the cervix. The GWAS data for 731 immunophenotypes and six GWAS data for CC from the FinnGen database were downloaded. Subsequently, a two-sample MR analysis was conducted using the MR Egger, Weighted median, Inverse variance weighted (IVW), Simple mode, and Weighted mode methods. Our study has identified the potential causal effects of immune traits on inflammatory diseases of the cervix, other noninflammatory disorders of the cervix uteri, carcinoma in situ of cervix uteri, adenocarcinomas of cervix, squamous cell neoplasms and carcinoma of cervix, as well as malignant neoplasm of the cervix uteri, with the respective numbers being 8, 6, 11, 8, 23, and 12, respectively. A strong correlation between classic monocytes and various cervical diseases was revealed. Furthermore, we discovered that B cells expressing BAFF-R have the ability to impede the advancement of malignant CC, specifically squamous cell neoplasms and carcinoma of cervix.

FinnGen,38680495,Inflammatory cytokine profiles in erectile dysfunction: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization.,"Inflammatory cytokines (ICs) play an important role in erectile dysfunction (ED). Previous studies have demonstrated that most ED patients have high levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). The causality between 41 ICs and ED is investigated using the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exposure data of 41 ICs came from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 8293 subjects. At the same time, the FINNGEN R9 database provided the ED outcome data containing 2205 ED patients and 164104 controls. MR-Egger (ME), inverse variance weighting (IVW), and weighted median (WM) were applied to conduct the MR study and IVW was taken as the main criterion. From a genetic perspective, the increase of interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) level significantly increased the risk of ED (P=0.043, odds ratio (OR)=1.269, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.007-1.600), while the increase of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) markedly decreased the risk of ED (P=0.037, OR=0.768, 95%CI: 0.600-0.984). Meanwhile, IP-10 (p=0.099) and IL-1RA (p=0.135) failed to demonstrate causality in reverse MR analysis. Changes in ICs levels will significantly affect the risk of ED, especially IP-10 as a risk component for ED and IL-1RA as a protective component for ED.

Increasing evidence has emphasized the importance of gut microbiome in the aetiology and development of DR. However, the causal relationship between gut microbes and DR remains largely unknown. To investigate the causal associations of DR with gut microbes and DR risk factors, we employed two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to estimate the causal effects of 207 gut microbes on DR outcomes. Inputs for MR included Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) summary statistics of 207 taxa of gut microbes (the Dutch Microbiome Project) and 21 risk factors for DR. The GWAS summary statistics data of DR was from the FinnGen Research Project. Data analysis was performed in May 2023. We identified eight bacterial taxa that exhibited significant causal associations with DR (FDR < 0.05). Among them, genus Collinsella and species Collinsella aerofaciens were associated with increased risk of DR, while the species Bacteroides faecis, Burkholderiales bacterium_1_1_47, Ruminococcus torques, Streptococcus salivarius, genus Burkholderiales_noname and family Burkholderiales_noname showed protective effects against DR. Notably, we found that the causal effect of species Streptococcus salivarius on DR was mediated through the level of host fasting glucose, a well-established risk factor for DR.

Using longitudinal health and genomics data on 453,733 Finnish individuals including 8801 CRC cases, we estimated the impact of a genome-wide CRC PRS on CRC screening initiation age through population-calibrated incidence estimation over the life course in men and women. Compared to the cumulative incidence of CRC at age 60 in Finland (the current age for starting screening in Finland), a comparable cumulative incidence was reached 5 and 11 years earlier in persons with high PRS (80-99% and >99%, respectively), while those with a low PRS (< 20%) reached comparable incidence 7 years later. The PRS was associated with increased risk of post-colonoscopy CRC after negative colonoscopy (hazard ratio 1.76 per PRS SD, 95% CI 1.54-2.01). Moreover, the PRS predicted colorectal adenoma incidence and improved incident CRC risk prediction over non-genetic risk factors. Our findings demonstrate that a CRC PRS can be used for risk stratification of CRC, with further research needed to optimally integrate the PRS into risk-based screening.",British journal of cancer,2024,Male; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Genetic Risk Score; Early Detection of Cancer; Colorectal Neoplasms; Risk; Colonoscopy; Risk Factors,False,9

Animal studies have also shown that antihyperglycemic drugs can improve seizures. However, it is unclear whether antihyperglycemic drugs have a causal role in epilepsy in humans. To investigate this potential causal relationship, a Mendelian randomisation study was conducted using International League Against Epilepsy data as the discovery set and FinnGen data as the replication set. It was discovered that three antidiabetic drug target genes, ETFDH, CYP21A2 and CYP2D6, were involved in the occurrence of epilepsy. In particular, ETFDH was identified as a target gene in both the discovery set (inverse variance weighting [IVW], odds ratio [OR] = 1.018, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.004-1.033, p = 0.009) and replication set (IVW, OR = 1.074, 95% CI, 1.034-1.114, p = 0.00016), and CYP21A2 was identified in the discovery set (IVW, OR = 1.029, 95% CI, 1.005-1.053, p = 0.016) and replication set (IVW, OR = 1.057, 95% CI, 1.001-1.116, p = 0.045) as having a causal association with an increased risk of epilepsy. Conversely, the CYP2D6 gene was found to be a protective factor for epilepsy in both the discovery set (IVW, OR = 0.0984, 95% CI, 0.969-0.998, p = 0.025) and replication set (IVW, OR = 0.977, 95% CI, 0.955-1.000, p = 0.046).

Then a series of analyses including Bayesian colocalization, Steiger filtering, and phenotype scanning were conducted to validate the credibility of the MR results. Subsequently, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, and druggability assessment were executed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Finally, the findings were corroborated using a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model. The MR analysis bolstered by robust evidence of colocalization, indicated a significant positive association between Prothrombin and increased IPF risk (OR = 3.26,95%CI 1.75-6.07). Conversely, Bone Sialoprotein (IBSP) demonstrated an inverse association with IPF susceptibility (OR = 0.27,95%CI 0.14-0.55).

Despite the identification of over 100 loci associated with migraine susceptibility through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the underlying causative genes and biological mechanisms remain predominantly elusive. The FinnGen R10 dataset, consisting of 333,711 subjects (20,908 cases and 312,803 controls), was utilized in conjunction with the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) v8 EQTls files to conduct cross-tissue transcriptome association studies (TWAS). Functional Summary-based Imputation (FUSION) was employed to validate these findings in single tissues. Additionally, candidate susceptibility genes were screened using Gene Analysis combined with Multi-marker Analysis of Genomic Annotation (MAGMA). Subsequent Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses were conducted. Furthermore, GeneMANIA analysis was employed to enhance our understanding of the functional implications of these susceptibility genes. We identified a total of 19 susceptibility genes associated with migraine in the cross-tissue TWAS analysis. Two novel susceptibility genes, REV1 and SREBF2, were validated through both single tissue TWAS and MAGMA analysis. Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses further confirmed these findings. REV1 may reduce the migraine risk by regulating DNA damage repair, while SREBF2 may increase the risk of migraine by regulating cholesterol metabolism.

In this study, we conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization(MR) to estimate whether GERD and COPD are causal. The GERD genetic data is from summary level data of a genome-wide association (GWAS) meta-analysis (Ncases = 71,522, Ncontrol=26,079). The COPD GWAS are available from the FinnGen (Ncases=16,410, Ncontrol=283,589). MR-Egger regression, Weighted Median, and Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) were used for MR analysis from the R package ""TwoSampleMR"", and IVW was the dominant estimation method. Additionally, the MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO), Cochran Q statistic, and leave-one-out analysis were used to detect and correct for the effect of heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. MR analysis indicated that GERD was causally associated with an increased risk of COPD (IVW odds ratio (OR): 1.3760, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1565-1.6371, P=0.0003), and vice versa (IVW OR: 1.1728, 95% CI:1.0613-1.2961, P=0.0018). The analyses did not reveal any pleiotropy or heterogeneity. Our study revealed possible evidence for a bidirectional causal relationship between GERD and COPD. Implementing screening and preventive strategies for GERD in individuals with COPD, and vice versa, will be crucial in future healthcare management. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the causal relationship between GERD and COPD.",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,2024,"Humans; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Odds Ratio; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Meta-Analysis as Topic",False,8
FinnGen,39730323,Phenome-wide investigation of bidirectional causal relationships between major depressive disorder and common human diseases.,"The high comorbidity of major depressive disorder (MDD) with other diseases has been well-documented. However, the pairwise causal connections for MDD comorbid networks are poorly characterized. We performed Phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to explore bidirectional causal associations between MDD (N = 807,553) and 877 common diseases from FinnGen datasets (N = 377,277). The inverse variance weighting method was the primary technique, and other methods (weighted median and MR-Egger) were used for sensitivity analyses. Our MR analyses showed that the genetic liability to MDD is causally associated with the risks of 324 disease phenotypes (average b: 0.339), including 46 psychiatric and behavioral disorders (average b: 0.618), 18 neurological diseases (average b: 0.348), 44 respiratory diseases (average b: 0.345), 40 digestive diseases (average b: 0.281), 18 circulatory diseases (average b: 0.237), 37 genitourinary diseases (average b: 0.271), 66 musculoskeletal and connective diseases (average b: 0.326), 22 endocrine diseases (average b: 0.302), and others. In a reverse analysis, a total of 51 genetic components predisposing to various diseases were causally associated with MDD risk (average b: 0.086), including 5 infectious diseases (average b: 0.056), 11 neurological diseases (average b: 0.106), 14 oncological diseases (average b: 0.108), and 5 psychiatric and behavioral disorders (average b: 0.114). Bidirectional causal associations were identified between MDD and 15 diseases. For most MR analyses, little evidence of heterogeneity and pleiotropy was detected. Our findings confirmed the extensive and significant causal role of genetic predisposition to MDD in contributing to human disease phenotypes, which were more pronounced than those seen in the reverse analysis of the causal influences of other diseases on MDD.",Translational psychiatry,2024,"Humans; Depressive Disorder, Major; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Phenotype; Comorbidity; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Phenomics",False,1
FinnGen,39614164,Assessment of bidirectional relationships between frailty and acute respiratory distress syndrome: a bidirectional Mendelian Randomization study.,"While previous observational studies have suggested a link between frailty and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the causality of this connection remains unclear. The objective of this study was to explore the potential bidirectional causal links between frailty and ARDS. A two-sample univariable Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to assess the causal relationship between frailty, as defined by frailty index (FI, n = 175,226) and fried frailty score (FFS, n = 386,565), and ARDS. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of frailty was from the UK Biobank and the ARDS data was from the FinnGen Database. Univariable MR analyses were conducted using inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, MR-Egger regression, and robust adjusted profile score (MR. RAPS). We also performed multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analysis including smoking initiation, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), and cognitive performance. This bidirectional MR analysis demonstrated no causal effect of FI (OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.14-6.88) and FFS (OR = 1.95, 95%CI 0.14-28.16) on increased susceptibility of ARDS. Also, no evidence was found for an effect of ARDS on the risk of frailty. The MVMR analysis indicated higher BMI and poorer cognitive performance were associated with increased risk of ARDS. The outcomes of our analysis imply a probable absence of a direct causal relationship between frailty and susceptibility to ARDS. To reinforce and expand upon these preliminary findings, it is imperative to conduct larger-scale genome-wide association studies.",BMC geriatrics,2024,Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Frailty; Aged; Genome-Wide Association Study; Female; Male; Frail Elderly; Middle Aged; United Kingdom; Risk Factors,False,0
FinnGen,39489852,Association between human blood metabolome and risk of myocarditis: a mendelian randomization study.,"Myocarditis is a common disease of the cardiovascular and immune systems, but the relationship between relevant blood metabolites and the risk of myocarditis has not been well-established. To identify potential biometabolic markers associated with myocarditis, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. We performed preliminary MR analysis using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, supplemented by MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode methods to adjust for false discovery rate (FDR). Confounders were screened using the GWAS Catalog website. Sensitivity analyses included Cochrane Q-test, Egger regression, Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO), scatterplots, funnel plots, and forest plots. For genetic and directional analysis, we employed co-localization analysis and the Steiger test. MR analysis was performed using the FinnGen database and meta-analysis was performed using the IEU database. MR analysis identified significant correlations for five metabolic biomarkers after FDR correction. These included four known metabolites: kynurenine, 1-stearoyl-GPE (18:0), deoxycarnitine, and 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil, as well as one unknown metabolite, X-25,422. Among these, kynurenine (OR = 1.441, 95%CI = 1.089-1.906, p-value = 0.018) and 1-stearoyl-GPE (18:0) (OR = 1.263, 95%CI = 1.029-1.550, p-value = 0.029) were identified as risk factors for myocarditis, while deoxycarnitine (OR = 0.813, 95%CI = 0.676-0.979, p-value = 0.029), 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (OR = 0.864, 95% CI = 0.775-0.962, p-value = 0.018), and X-25,422 (OR = 0.721, 95%CI = 0.587-0.886, p-value = 0.009) were found to be protective factors. No evidence of heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, or sensitivity issues was observed, and no shared genetic factors between exposure and outcome were detected. The causality was in the correct direction. Meta-analysis further confirmed the causal relationship between the five metabolites and myocarditis. This study identifies a causal relationship between five circulating metabolites and myocarditis. Kynurenine, 1-stearoyl-GPE (18:0), deoxycarnitine, X-25,422, and 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil may serve as potential drug targets for myocarditis, providing a theoretical basis for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the condition.",Scientific reports,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Myocarditis; Metabolome; Biomarkers; Genome-Wide Association Study; Risk Factors; Carnitine; Kynurenine; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,2

We investigated the causal relationship between EoE and IBD and its subtypes via a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. MR analyses were performed using summary data of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on individuals of European ancestry. Independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms correlated with EoE (from a GWAS meta-analysis containing 1,930 cases and 13,634 controls) and IBD (from FinnGen GWASs containing 9,083 IBD, 2,033 CD, and 5,931 UC cases, and GWASs of IBD genetic consortium containing 12,882 IBD, 6,968 UC, and 5,956 CD cases) were selected as instruments. We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary analysis followed by several sensitivity analyses. For the forward MR study, estimates from IVW methods were subsequently meta-analyzed using a random-effect model. Our results suggested a causal effect of EoE on IBD [pooled odds ratio (OR), 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.13] and EoE on UC (pooled OR, 1.09, 95% CI, 1.04-1.14). No causal link between EoE and CD was observed (pooled OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.96-1.16). The reverse MR analyses revealed no causal effect of IBD (and its subtypes) on EoE. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of primary results. Our findings provided evidence of a suggestive causal effect of EoE on IBD (specifically on UC) in the European population. Increased awareness of concurrent or subsequent IBD in patients with EoE is called for. Still, the present evidence is not adequate enough and ought to be validated by further investigations.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,"Humans; Eosinophilic Esophagitis; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Crohn Disease",False,5
FinnGen,38484892,Causal association between years of schooling and the risk of traumatic brain injury: A two-sample mendelian randomization analysis.,"To investigate whether the number of years of schooling are causally associated traumatic brain injury (TBI). We aimed to investigate whether the number of years of schooling are causally associated TBI. We investigate the prospective causal effect of years of schooling on TBI using summary statistical data. The statistical dataset comprising years of schooling (n = 293,723) from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) deposited in the UK Biobank was used for exposure. We used the following GWAS available in the FinnGen dataset: individuals with TBI (total = 13,165; control = 136,576; number of single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] = 16,380,088). Seventy significant genome-wide SNPs from GWAS datasets with annotated years of schooling were selected as instrumental variables. The inverse variance weighted method results supported a causal relationship between years of schooling and TBI (odds ratio (OR), 0.78; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.62-0.98; P = 0.029). MR-Egger regression showed that polydirectionality was unlikely to bias the results (intercept = 0.007, SE = 0.01, P = 0.484) and demonstrated no causal relationship between years of schooling and TBI (OR, 0.52; 95%CI, 0.17-1.64; P = 0.270). The weighted median method revealed a causal relationship with TBI (OR, 0.73; 95%CI, 0.55-0.98; P = 0.047). A Cochran's Q test and funnel plot did not show heterogeneity nor asymmetry, indicating no directional pleiotropy. The current investigation yields substantiation of a causal association between years of schooling and TBI development. More years of schooling may be causally associated with a reduced risk of TBI, which has implications for clinical and public health practices and policies.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Prospective Studies; Causality; Educational Status,False,1

We used Mendelian randomization (MR) with genetic variation as instrumental variables (IVs) to assess the causality between SB/PA/SD and obesity. Genetic variants associated with SB/PA/SD were obtained from Genome-wide association study (GWAS), and obesity data came from FinnGen. The primary MR analysis used the instrumental variable weighted (IVW) method, with sensitivity tests including Cochran Q, MR-Egger intercepts, and MR-Radial. Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) analysis was applied to identify significant genetic associations and biological pathways in obesity-related tissues. The MR analysis revealed causal relationships between four SB-related lifestyle patterns and obesity. Specifically, increased genetic liability to television watching (IVW MR Odds ratio [OR] = 1.55, [95% CI]:[1.27, 1.90], p = 1.67×10-5), computer use ([OR] = 1.52, [95% CI]:[1.08, 2.13], p = 1.61×10-2), leisure screen time (LST) ([OR] = 1.62, [95% CI] = [1.43, 1.84], p = 6.49×10-14, and driving (MR [OR] = 2.79, [95% CI]:[1.25, 6.21], p = 1.23×10-2) was found to increase the risk of obesity. Our findings indicate that no causal relationships were observed between SB at work, sedentary commuting, PA, SD, and obesity. The eQTL analysis revealed strong associations between specific genes (RPS26, TTC12, CCDC92, NICN1) and SNPs (rs10876864, rs2734849, rs4765541, rs7615206) in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues, which are associated with these SBs. Enrichment analysis further revealed that these genes are involved in crucial biological pathways, including cortisol synthesis, thyroid hormone synthesis, and insulin secretion. Our findings support a causal relationship between four specific SBs (LST, television watching, computer use, driving) and obesity. These results provide valuable insights into potential interventions to address obesity effectively, supported by genetic associations in the eQTL and enrichment analysis.

FinnGen,39328405,"CXCR1 and CXCR2 are potential neutrophil extracellular trap-related treatment targets in ulcerative colitis: insights from Mendelian randomization, colocalization and transcriptomic analysis.","There is already substantial evidence indicating that neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation contributes to the inflammatory cascade in ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the precise regulatory mechanisms governing this process remain elusive. This study aimed to determine the role of NET-related genes in UC and reveal possible mechanisms. Employing a two-sample MR methodology, we investigated the correlations between NET-associated genes (NRGs) and UC with summary data derived from a genome-wide association study (12,366 cases vs. 33,609 controls) and FinnGen (8,279 cases vs. 261,098 controls). The main analysis employed the inverse variance weighted method, supplemented by the MR-Egger method and weighted median method. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to rule out the interference of heterogeneity and pleiotropy among utilized instrument variables. The colocalization analysis was used to determine whether the identified NRGs and UC shared casual variants. Cross-tissue expression analysis was performed to characterize the expression patterns of target NRGs, while multi-gene correlation analysis and GSEA analysis were conducted to explore the mechanisms by which target NRGs promote UC and NET formation. Immunohistochemistry was used to validate the protein expression of target NRGs in the colon tissue of UC patients. After the validation of two datasets, seven NRGs were associated with the risk of UC. The higher expression of ITGB2 was associated with increased UC risk, while the expression of CXCR1, CXCR2, IRAK4, MAPK3, SIGLEC14, and SLC22A4 were inversely associated with UC risk. Colocalization analysis supported the correlation between CXCR1/2 and UC risk. Expression analysis indicated that CXCR1/2 were down-regulated in peripheral blood, but up-regulated in colon tissue. GSEA analysis and correlation analysis indicated that CXCR1/2 promoted UC and NET formation through neutrophil chemotaxis and PAD4-mediated pathways, separately. Immunohistochemical results confirmed the high expression of CXCR1/2 in colon tissues of UC patients. Our study identified CXCR1/2 as candidate targets in UC among all NRGs through multi-method argumentation, providing new insights of the regulation mechanisms of NET formation in the pathogenesis of UC.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,"Humans; Colitis, Ulcerative; Receptors, Interleukin-8B; Genome-Wide Association Study; Receptors, Interleukin-8A; Extracellular Traps; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Gene Expression Profiling; Neutrophils; Transcriptome",False,5

This investigation seeks to elucidate the causal influence of reproductive traits on NAFLD and determine the intervening role of health condition and socioeconomic status in these connections. Utilizing a Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach, this research leveraged a comprehensive dataset from the Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) database. The study incorporated body mass index, major depression, educational level, household income and Townsend deprivation index as intermediary variables. Initially, a bidirectional two-sample MR study was conducted to explore the genetic associations between reproductive traits and NAFLD. Then, two-step MR analyses were implemented to quantify the extent of mediation by these indicators. The weighted inverse variance method was the primary analytical approach, complemented by several sensitivity analyses to affirm the robustness of the MR assumptions. Finally, these findings were validated in the FinnGen research. The bidirectional MR analysis indicated that earlier reproductive traits (age at menarche, age at first sexual intercourse, and age at first birth) were associated with an elevated risk of NAFLD, absent any evidence of the reverse relationship. Body mass index accounted for 35.64% of the association between premature menarche and NAFLD. Additionally, body mass index, major depression, educational level and household income mediated 41.65%, 14.35%, 37.88%, and 18.59% of the connection between early sexual intercourse and NAFLD, respectively. Similarly, these same variables elucidated 36.36%, 15.58%, 41.56%, and 22.73% of the correlation between younger age at first birth and NAFLD.

We aimed to investigate the causal relation between NAFLD and various pregnancy events, and to elucidate the underlying mediating pathways while determining the proportion of this correlation that is mediated through these pathways. A genome-wide association study involving over 6 million participants employing Mendelian randomization (MR) and mediation analysis was performed. The study used genetically predicted NAFLD as exposures and cardiometabolic traits as mediators, with various adverse pregnancy events as outcomes. The main analysis was performed using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach, while sensitivity analyses included the weighted median, weighted mode, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO methods. Mediation analyses were performed using a two-step MR framework. In this MR cohort study, NAFLD was found to be strongly associated with elevated risks of GDM (P = 0.019 for the discovery dataset, P < 0.001 for the discovery dataset) and HDPs, including any HDP (P < 0.001 for the both datasets), gestational hypertension (P = 0.007 for the discovery dataset, P < 0.001 for the discovery dataset), and pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (P = 0.040 for the discovery dataset, P < 0.001 for the discovery dataset). However, no significant associations were found with hemorrhage in early pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage, preterm birth, or offspring birthweight for both datasets. Cardiometabolic traits played a significant mediating role in these associations, rather than solely acting as confounding factors.

FinnGen,37634759,Genome-Wide Meta-analysis Identifies Risk Loci and Improves Disease Prediction of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"To identify age-related macular degeneration (AMD) risk loci and to establish a polygenic prediction model. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) and polygenic risk score (PRS) construction. We included 64 885 European patients with AMD and 568 740 control participants (with overlapped samples) in the UK Biobank, Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA), International AMD Consortium, FinnGen, and published early AMD GWASs in meta-analyses, as well as 733 European patients with AMD and 20 487 control participants from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) and non-Europeans from the UK Biobank and GERA for polygenic risk score validation. A multitrait meta-analysis of GWASs comprised 64 885 patients with AMD and 568 740 control participants; the multitrait approach accounted for sample overlap. We constructed a PRS for AMD based on both previously reported as well as unreported AMD loci. We applied the PRS to nonoverlapping data from the CLSA. We identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with AMD and established a PRS for AMD risk prediction. We identified 63 AMD risk loci alongside the well-established AMD loci CFH and ARMS2, including 9 loci that were not reported in previous GWASs, some of which previously were linked to other eye diseases such as glaucoma (e.g., HIC1). We applied our PRS to nonoverlapping data from the CLSA. A new PRS was constructed using the PRS method, PRS-CS, and significantly improved the prediction accuracy of AMD risk compared with PRSs from previously published datasets. We further showed that even people who carry all the well-known AMD risk alleles at CFH and ARMS2 vary considerably in their AMD risk (ranging from close to 0 in individuals with low PRS to > 50% in individuals with high PRS). Although our PRS was derived in individuals of European ancestry, the PRS shows potential for predicting risk in people of East Asian, South Asian, and Latino ancestry. Our findings improve the knowledge of the genetic architecture of AMD and help achieve better accuracy in AMD prediction.

FinnGen,39214524,Association of gut microbiota with acute kidney injury: a two-sample Mendelian randomisation and case-control study.,"Epidemiologic studies have implicated the gut microbiota in acute kidney injury (AKI), but the causal relationship is unclear. Using Mendelian randomisation, we explored the causal role of gut microbiota in the development of acute kidney injury after excluding confounding and reverse causality. Mendel randomised (MR) study was conducted using data from intestinal microbiota and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) disease of acute kidney injury and the sequencing data of case-control study confirmed this finding. The summary statistics of intestinal microbiota (n = 13,266) conducted by MiBioGen Alliance was taken as the exposure, while the statistics of acute kidney injury obtained from FinnGen Alliance data (2,383 cases and 212,841 controls) were taken as the results. A total of 42 patients were included in this case-control study. Evidence for the protective causal associations of the genus Flavonifractor id.2059 with AKI was found in inverse variance weighting (odds ratio = 0.48 [95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.72]; P = 0.0003). Additionally, a case-control study showed that the relative abundance of the genus Flavonifractor id.2059 ( P = 0.0169) in septic non-AKI patients was higher than that in septic AKI patients. Compared with S-AKI patients who died within 28 days, the relative abundance of the genus Flavonifractor id.2059 in surviving patients was higher ( P = 0.0281).

FinnGen,39157683,Association between gut microbiota and diabetic microvascular complications: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Gut microbiota (GM) homeostasis in the human body is closely associated with health, which can be used as a regulator for preventing the onset and progression of disease. Diabetic microvascular complications bring about not only a huge economic burden to society, but also miserable mental and physical pain. Thus, alteration of the GM may be a method to delay diabetic microvascular complications. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to reveal the causal inference between GM and three core diabetic microvascular complications, namely, diabetic kidney disease (DKD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and diabetic neuropathy (DNP). First, genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for GM from the MiBioGen consortium and three main diabetic microvascular complications acquired from the FinnGen research project were assessed. Second, a forward MR analysis was conducted to assess the causality of GM on the risk of DKD, DR, and DNP. Third, a series of sensitivity studies, such as heterogeneity tests, pleiotropy evaluations, and leave-one-out analyses, were further conducted to assess the accuracy of MR analysis. Finally, Steiger tests and reverse MR analyses were performed to appraise the possibility of reverse causation. A total of 2,092 single-nucleotide polymorphisms related to 196 bacterial traits were selected as instrumental variables. This two-sample MR analysis provided strongly reasonable evidence that 28 genetically predicted abundance of specific GM that played non-negligible roles in the occurrence of DKD, DR, and DNP complications were causally associated with 23 GM, the odds ratio of which generally ranged from 0.9 to 1.1. Further sensitivity analysis indicated low heterogeneity, low pleiotropy, and high reliability of the causal estimates. The study raised the possibility that GM may be a potential target to prevent and delay the progression of diabetic microvascular complications.

In addition, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been shown to efficiently stratify breast cancer risk through combining information about common genetic factors into one measure. In longitudinal real-life data, we evaluate PRS, FH, and PVs for stratified screening. Using FinnGen (N = 117,252), linked to the Mass Screening Registry for breast cancer (1992-2019; nationwide organized biennial screening for age 50-69 years), we assessed the screening performance of a breast cancer PRS and compared its performance with FH of breast cancer and PVs in moderate- ( Effect sizes for FH, PVs, and high PRS (>90th percentile) were comparable in screening-aged women, with similar implications for shifting age at screening onset. A high PRS identified women more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer after a positive screening finding (positive predictive value [PPV], 39.5% [95% CI, 37.6 to 41.5]). Combinations of risk factors increased the PPVs up to 45% to 50%. A high PRS conferred an elevated risk of interval breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 2.78 [95% CI, 2.00 to 3.86] at age 50 years; HR, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.67 to 3.70] at age 60 years), and women with a low PRS (<10th percentile) had a low risk for both interval- and screen-detected breast cancers.

FinnGen,39143707,Statins inhibit paclitaxel-induced PD-L1 expression and increase CD8+ T cytotoxicity for better prognosis in breast cancer.,"In recent years, the widespread use of lipid-lowering drugs, especially statins, has attracted people's attention. Statin use may be potentially associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. To explore the relationship between statin use and cancer risk. And further explore the potential role of statins in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. Data for the Mendelian randomization portion of the study were obtained from genome-wide association studies of common cancers in the UK Biobank and FinnGen studies and from the Global Lipid Genetics Consortium's low density lipoprotein (LDL). In addition, the impacts of statins and chemotherapy drugs on breast cancer were examined using both in vitro and in vivo models, with particular attention to the expression levels of the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1 and its potential to suppress tumor growth. Data from about 3.8 million cancer patients and ~1.3 million LDL-measuring individuals were analyzed. Genetically proxied HMGCR inhibition (statins) was associated with breast cancer risk reduction (P=0.0005). In vitro experiments showed that lovastatin significantly inhibited paclitaxel-induced PD-L1 expression and assisted paclitaxel in suppressing tumor cell growth. Furthermore, the combination therapy involving lovastatin and paclitaxel amplified CD8+ T-cell infiltration, bolstering their tumor-killing capacity and enhancing in vivo efficacy. The utilization of statins is correlated with improved prognoses for breast cancer patients and may play a role in facilitating the transition from cold to hot tumors. Combination therapy with lovastatin and paclitaxel enhances CD8+ T-cell activity and leads to better prognostic characteristics.","International journal of surgery (London, England)",2024,Breast Neoplasms; B7-H1 Antigen; Female; Paclitaxel; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Prognosis; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Mice; Animals; Lovastatin; Genome-Wide Association Study,False,8
FinnGen,38844880,New evidence: Metformin unsuitable as routine adjuvant for breast cancer: a drug-target mendelian randomization analysis.,"The potential efficacy of metformin in breast cancer (BC) has been hotly discussed but never conclusive. This genetics-based study aimed to evaluate the relationships between metformin targets and BC risk. Metformin targets from DrugBank and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from IEU OpenGWAS and FinnGen were used to investigate the breast cancer (BC)-metformin causal link with various Mendelian Randomization (MR) methods (e.g., inverse-variance-weighting). The genetic association between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the drug target of metformin was also analyzed as a positive control. Sensitivity and pleiotropic tests ensured reliability. The primary targets of metformin are PRKAB1, ETFDH and GPD1L. We found a causal association between PRKAB1 and T2D (odds ratio [OR] 0.959, P = 0.002), but no causal relationship was observed between metformin targets and overall BC risk (PRKAB1: OR 0.990, P = 0.530; ETFDH: OR 0.986, P = 0.592; GPD1L: OR 1.002, P = 0.806). A noteworthy causal relationship was observed between ETFDH and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BC (OR 0.867, P = 0.018), and between GPD1L and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative BC (OR 0.966, P = 0.040). Other group analyses did not yield positive results. The star target of metformin, PRKAB1, does not exhibit a substantial causal association with the risk of BC. Conversely, metformin, acting as an inhibitor of ETFDH and GPD1L, may potentially elevate the likelihood of developing ER-positive BC and HER2-negative BC. Consequently, it is not advisable to employ metformin as a standard supplementary therapy for BC patients without T2D.",BMC cancer,2024,"Humans; Metformin; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Genome-Wide Association Study; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Hypoglycemic Agents; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8

Summary single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-phenotype association data were obtained from published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) using the FinnGen and UK Biobank databases. A series of screening processes were performed to select qualified SNPs strongly related to exposure. We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW), the Mendelian Randomization robust adjusted profile score (MR-RAPS), the Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO), and the Weighted Median to estimate the causal links between sleep traits and the risk of thyroid cancer. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. The IVW results showed that getting up in the morning (OR = 0.055, 95%CI: 0.004-0.741) and napping during day (OR = 0.031, 95%CI: 0.002-0.462) were associated with decreased risk of thyroid cancer in the Italian population.

The study included 10,074 individuals with PCOS and 103,164 controls for the primary analysis, with validation analysis repeated in the FinnGen R9 and EstBB PCOS cohorts. Female-specific thyroid function GWAS data were obtained from European population, including Hyperthyroidism (22,383 cases and 54,288 controls) and Hypothyroidism (27,383 cases and 54,288 controls) from the UK Biobank, and TSH (54,288 cases and 72,167 controls) and FT4 (49,269 cases and 72,167 controls) within the reference range from the ThyroidOmics Consortium. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was chosen as the principal method, and sensitivity analysis was conducted to test for the presence of horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity. The IVW analysis indicated nominal significance between normal TSH levels and PCOS after adjusted for age and BMI [OR (95% CI) = 0.78(0.62,0.97), P = 0.029], suggesting that maintaining normal TSH levels might act as a protective factor against the pathogenesis of PCOS. Besides, in order to increase the statistical power, we pooled PCOS GWAS above together by meta-analysis and found PCOS contributed to the occurrence of hyperthyroidism [OR(95%CI) = 1.37(0.73,2.57), P = 0.012]. However, no causal relationship was found after Bonferroni correction (P-value < 0.0031).

LDSC analysis indicated significant (P value < 0.05) genetic correlations between 39 ECG features and IHD. MR analysis performed by five approaches showed a putative causal effect of IHD on four S wave related ECG features at lead III. Integrating PRS for these ECG features with age and gender, the XGBoost model achieved Area Under Curve (AUC) 0.72 in predicting IHD.

In this study, we used a 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to estimate the association of smoking, alcohol intake, and coffee intake with the risk of BP. We extracted genetic variants associated with smoking initiation and cigarettes per day from the Genome-Wide Association Study and Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine Use database (944,625 individuals). We also extracted genetic variants associated with past tobacco smoking, alcohol intake frequency, and coffee intake from the UK Biobank database (1,316,166 individuals). BP outcomes were chosen from the FinnGen genome-wide association studies (GWAS) database (7987 patients and 188,868 controls). The inverse variance-weighted method was used primarily to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Sensitivity analysis using different approaches such as weighted median, MR Egger, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) have been implemented, as well as leave-one-out analysis to identify pleiotropy. The 2-sample MR analysis supported the causal association of genetically predicted cigarettes per day (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: [1.08-1.39], P < .01] and smoking initiation (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: [1.03-1.44], P = .02) with the risk of BP, but not past tobacco smoking, alcohol intake frequency, and coffee intake. Heterogeneity (P > .05) and pleiotropy (P > .05) tests provided confirmatory evidence for the validity of our MR estimates. Our findings provide relevant evidence for a favorable causal association of genetically predicted smoking initiation and cigarettes per day with BP risk.

FinnGen,39357585,Association between Omega-3 fatty acids and autoimmune disease: Evidence from the umbrella review and Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Autoimmune diseases are a group of disorders characterized by abnormal immune responses that mistakenly target and attack healthy cells, tissues, and organs, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage. Omega-3 fatty acids possess anti-inflammatory activities and may decrease abnormal immune activity. However, the role of omega-3 fatty acids in various autoimmune diseases is still unclear. This umbrella review and Mendelian randomization (MR) study aims to summarize the highest available evidence on omega-3 fatty acids and autoimmune disease. We conducted an umbrella review by searching electronic databases to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The selection criteria included systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis, which evaluated omega-3 fatty acids as the exposure and autoimmune disease as the outcome variable. Two authors independently assessed the overlapping and quality of the reviews using the AMSTAR-2 tool. We also performed MR studies to investigate the potential causal effect of fatty acids on the risk of various autoimmune diseases, utilizing data from the meta-analysis of the UKB-TOPMed and FinnGen cohorts. The umbrella review identified 21 studies (8 systematic reviews and 13 meta-analyses) on 9 autoimmune diseases and 30 diseases in the MR study. AMSTAR 2 categorized the quality of evidence in six studies as critically low, six studies as low, eight studies as moderate, and one as high-quality evidence. The consistent result between the review and the MR study demonstrated the benefit of omega-3 fatty acids on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Additionally, in our summary review, omega-3 fatty acids can improve disease activity and inflammation biomarkers; however, MR studies provided no consistent evidence for the causal effects of omega-3 fatty acids on psoriasis, multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes (T1D), IgA nephropathy (IgAN), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC). The current study presented solid evidence highlighting the advantageous impact of omega-3 fatty acids on SLE and RA. This was achieved through the reduction of disease risk, the decrease of disease activity, and the mitigation of inflammatory biomarkers.

This study aimed to explore the causal connections between gallstones/cholecystectomy and cancer risk by utilizing a bidirectional two-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization approach with Genome-Wide Association Studies data. Utilizing Genome-Wide Association Studies data from the UK Biobank and FinnGen, this research employed multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses to explore the impact of gallstones and cholecystectomy on the risk of 33 distinct cancer types. Instrumental variables for gallstones and cholecystectomy were carefully selected to ensure robust analyses, and sensitivity and heterogeneity tests were conducted to verify the findings' validity. Multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis, incorporating data from more than 450,000 individuals for gallstones and cholecystectomy, revealed nuanced associations with cancer risk. Cholecystectomy was associated with a significantly increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.21 to 2.10, P = 0.001), while gallstones were linked to a decreased risk of the same cancer type (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.84, P = 0.002). Interestingly, the analysis also suggested that cholecystectomy may lower the risk of small intestine tumors (OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.043 to 0.71, P = 0.015), with gallstones showing an inverse relationship, indicating an increased risk (OR = 6.41, 95% CI: 1.48 to 27.80, P = 0.013). The multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis highlights the differential impact of gallstones and cholecystectomy on cancer risk, specifically for nonmelanoma skin cancer and small intestine tumors.

This study aimed to investigate whether some common thyroid diseases can cause DVT using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. This two-sample MR study used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by the FinnGen genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to be highly associated with some common thyroid diseases, including autoimmune hyperthyroidism (962 cases and 172,976 controls), subacute thyroiditis (418 cases and 187,684 controls), hypothyroidism (26,342 cases and 59,827 controls), and malignant neoplasm of the thyroid gland (989 cases and 217,803 controls. These SNPs were used as instruments. Outcome datasets for the GWAS on DVT (6,767 cases and 330,392 controls) were selected from the UK Biobank data, which was obtained from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) open GWAS project. The inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger and weighted median methods were used to estimate the causal association between DVT and thyroid diseases. The Cochran's Q test was used to quantify the heterogeneity of the instrumental variables (IVs). MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier test (MR-PRESSO) was used to detect horizontal pleiotropy. When the causal relationship was significant, bidirectional MR analysis was performed to determine any reverse causal relationships between exposures and outcomes. This MR study illustrated that autoimmune hyperthyroidism slightly increased the risk of DVT according to the IVW [odds ratio (OR) = 1.0009; p = 0.024] and weighted median methods [OR = 1.001; p = 0.028]. According to Cochran's Q test, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in IVs. Additionally, MR-PRESSO did not detect horizontal pleiotropy (p = 0.972). However, no association was observed between other thyroid diseases and DVT using the IVW, weighted median, and MR-Egger regression methods.

We employed Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to examine the causal relationships between 50 modifiable risk factors (RFs) and AF. Instrumental variables for genetically predicted exposures were derived from corresponding genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Summary-level statistical data for AF were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis (discovery dataset, N = 1,030,836) and FinnGen (validation dataset, N = 208,594). Univariable and multivariable MR analyses were performed, primarily using inverse variance weighted method with a series of robust sensitivity analyses. Genetic predisposition to insomnia, daytime naps, apnea, smoking initiation, moderate to vigorous physical activity and obesity traits, including body mass index, waist-hip ratio, central and peripheral fat/fat-free mass, exhibited significant associations with an increased risk of AF. Coffee consumption and ApoB had suggestive increased risks. Hypertension (odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.26 (4.42, 6.24)), heart failure (HF) (OR 95% CI, 4.77 (2.43, 9.37)) and coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR 95% CI: 1.20 (1.16, 1.24)) were strongly associated with AF, while college degree, higher education attachment and HDL levels were associated with a decreased AF risk. Reverse MR found a bidirectional relationship between genetically predicted AF and CAD, HF and ischemic stroke. Multivariable analysis further indicated that obesity-related traits, systolic blood pressure and lower HDL levels independently contributed to the development of AF.

We performed bidirectional MR analyses by large genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The data included a large-scale OLP dataset, as well as datasets of 41 inflammatory cytokines. All data were obtained from the University of Bristol database, which includes 41 inflammatory cytokines, and the GWAS Catalog database, which includes 91 inflammatory cytokines. OLP data were obtained from the Finngen database, which includes 6411 cases and 405770 healthy controls. We used the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, MR-Egger method, weighted median method, simple mode method and weighted mode method to analyze the causal relationship between inflammatory cytokines and OLP, and we also combined with sensitivity analysis to further verify the robustness of the results. We performed a meta-analysis of positive or potentially positive results for the same genes to confirm the reliability of the final results. We primarily used the IVW analysis method, corrected using the Benjamin Hochberg (BH) method. When p<0.00038 (0.05/132), the results are significantly causal; when 0.00038<p<0.05, the results are potentially causal. We found a total of 7 inflammatory cytokines with significant or potential associations with OLP (University of Bristol database: 2, GWAS Catalog database: 5). In the reverse analysis, we found that a total of 30 inflammatory cytokines were significantly or potentially associated with OLP (University of Bristol database: 5, GWAS Catalog database: 25). After sensitivity analysis and meta-analysis, we finally determined that there was a causal relationship between a total of 3 inflammatory cytokines and OLP in the forward analysis, the most significant of which was FGF21 (p=0.02954, odds ratio (OR): 1.113, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.011-1.226).

Traditional observational studies face issues with confounding factors, complicating the interpretation of causality. This study seeks to determine the genetic link between these medications and the risk of psoriatic arthritis. This drug target study utilized the Mendelian randomization strategy. We harnessed high-quality data from population-level genome-wide association studies sourced from the UK Biobank and FinnGen databases. The inverse variance-weighted method, complemented by robust pleiotropy methods, was employed. We examined the causal relationships between three lipid-lowering agents and psoriatic arthritis to unveil the underlying mechanisms. A significant association was observed between genetically represented proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition and a decreased risk of psoriatic arthritis (odds ratio [OR]: 0.51; 95% CI 0.14-0.88; P < 0.01). This association was further corroborated in an independent dataset (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.25-0.94; P = 0.03). Sensitivity analyses affirmed the absence of statistical evidence for pleiotropic or genetic confounding biases. However, no substantial associations were identified for either 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors or Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 inhibitors. This Mendelian randomization analysis underscores the pivotal role of PCSK9 in the etiology of psoriatic arthritis.

However, whether there is a genetic causal effect between serum trace elements, nutrients, and autoimmune diseases remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the causal effects of serum trace elements and nutrients on 21 autoimmune diseases using Mendelian randomization (MR). Single nucleotide polymorphisms for the exposure factors (serum trace elements and vitamins) were obtained from the published UK Biobank database and genome-wide association study (GWAS) public databases. Outcome GWAS data were derived from the FinnGen database. MR was employed to explore the causal relationships between 9 trace elements and 6 vitamins and autoimmune diseases. Causal inference was performed using inverse variance weighted methods, MR Egger, and weighted median methods. Subsequently, heterogeneity tests, horizontal pleiotropy tests, MR-PRESSO tests, and leave-one-out analyses were conducted for sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the study results. Finally, trace elements and vitamins that were statistically significant in the IVW method and had consistent effect sizes and odds ratios across five methods were selected as exposure factors with a causal relationship to diabetes and its complications.

This study used bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the interactions between nine phenotypes associated with hypertension, heart failure, atrial fibrillation (AF), and coronary heart disease (CHD), and brain cortex measurements. These measurements included total surface area (SA), average thickness (TH), and the SA and TH of 34 regions defined by the Desikan-Killiany atlas. The nine traits were obtained from sources such as the UK Biobank and FinnGen, etc., while MRI-derived traits of cortical structure were sourced from the ENIGMA Consortium. The primary estimate was obtained using the inverse-variance weighted approach. A false discovery rate adjustment was applied to the p-values (resulting in q-values) in the analyses of regional cortical structures. A total of 1,260 two-sample MR analyses were conducted. Existing CHD demonstrated an influence on the SA of the banks of the superior temporal sulcus (bankssts) (q=0.018) and the superior frontal lobe (q=0.018), while hypertension was associated with changes in the TH of the lateral occipital region (q=0.02). Regarding the effects of the brain cortex on CVD incidence, total SA was significantly associated with the risk of CHD. Additionally, 16 and 3 regions exhibited significant effects on blood pressure and AF risk, respectively (q<0.05). These regions were primarily located in the frontal, temporal, and cingulate areas, which are associated with cognitive function and mood regulation.

Employing the largest available gut microbiome and aortic aneurysm Genome-Wide Association Study databases, including MiBioGen, Dutch Microbiome Project, FinnGen, UK Biobank, and Michigan Genomics Initiative, this study performs two-sample bidirectional MR analyses. Instrumental variables, linked to microbiome taxa at significant levels, were selected for identifying relationships with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA), and aortic dissection (AD). Methods like inverse variance weighted, MR-PRESSO, MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and mode-based estimate were used for MR analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochran Q test. MR-Egger regression and MR-PRESSO addressed potential unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy. The analysis did not find any evidence of statistically significant associations between the gut microbiome and aortic aneurysm diseases after adjusting for the false discovery rate (FDR). Specifically, while initial results suggested correlations between 19 taxa and AAA, 25 taxa and TAA, and 13 taxa with AD, these suggested associations did not hold statistical significance post-FDR correction. Therefore, the role of individual gut microbial taxa as independent factors in the development and progression of aortic aneurysm diseases remains inconclusive. This finding underscores the necessity for larger sample sizes and more comprehensive studies to further investigate these potential links. The study emphasizes the complex relationship between the gut microbiome and aortic aneurysm diseases. Although no statistically significant associations were found after FDR correction, the findings provide valuable insights and highlight the importance of considering gut microbiota in aortic aneurysm diseases research.

However, the causal relationships and potential therapeutic targets remain unclear. Leveraging the MRC IEU OpenGWAS data infrastructure, we extracted 1254 peripheral immune systems and 792 BBB biomarkers as genetic instruments for exposure. MS risk data from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) (47,429 MS cases, 68,374 controls) served as one outcome, replicated in FinnGen (1048 cases, 217,141 controls) and the UK Biobank (1679 cases, 461,254 controls). Genetic associations with MS severity derived from IMSGC and MultipleMS Consortium GWAS data (12,584 cases). Two-sample, bidirectional, and protein drug-target MR analyses were conducted, along with interaction analysis of identified proteins and druggability assessment. Causal relationships between 45 immunological markers, 15 BBB markers, and MS risk were strongly supported. In peripheral immunity, the causal associations with MS are predominantly concentrated in CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. Notably, anti-Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG levels exhibited the most significant causal effect on MS risk (OR = 225.62, P = 5.63E-208), replicated in the MS severity (OR = 1.11, P = 0.04). Weak causal evidence was found between 62 immunological markers, 35 BBB markers, and MS severity. Reverse MR analysis suggested potential causal effects of MS risk on 8 markers.

The latest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for FI, which included individuals of European ancestry from UK Biobank and TwinGene (N = 175,226), yielded the genetic instruments for frailty and outcome summary statistics. The genetic instrument for COPD and asthma, as well as the outcome summary data, were derived from the GWAS conducted on individuals of European ancestry from the FinnGen, with a sample size of 16,410 cases and 283,589 controls for COPD, and 37,253 cases and 187,112 controls for asthma. The analysis of MR was conducted employing the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, complemented by the weighted median method, MR-Egger regression, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test. Our results showed that genetically predicted higher FI was significantly associated with increased risk of COPD (odds ratio [OR] 1.75, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.29-2.36) and asthma (OR 2.10, 95 % CI 1.44-3.16). In the reverse direction analysis, genetic liability to both COPD (beta 0.06, 95 % CI 0.01-0.10) and asthma (beta 0.08, 95 % CI 0.06-0.11) showed significant associations with a higher FI. Our research has reinforced the existing evidence supporting a reciprocal causal relationship between frailty and obstructive lung diseases.

FinnGen,39578729,Plasma pQTL and brain eQTL integration identifies PNKP as a therapeutic target and reveals mechanistic insights into migraine pathophysiology.,"Migraine is a prevalent neurological disorder affecting 14.1% of the global population. Despite advances in genetic research, further investigation is needed to identify therapeutic targets and better understand its mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to identify drug targets and explore the relationships between gene expression, protein levels, and migraine pathophysiology. We utilized cis-pQTL data from deCODE Genetics, combined with migraine GWAS data from the GERA + UKB cohort as the discovery cohort and the FinnGen R10 cohort as the replication cohort. SMR and MR analyses identified migraine-associated protein loci. Brain eQTL data from GTEx v8 and BrainMeta v2 were used to explore causal relationships between gene expression, protein levels, and migraine risk. Mediation analysis assessed the role of metabolites, and PheWAS evaluated potential side effects. Four loci were identified: PNKP, MRVI1, CALCB, and INPP5B. PNKP and MRVI1 showed a high level of evidence and opposing effects at the gene and protein levels. PNKP gene expression in certain brain regions was protective against migraine, while its plasma protein levels were positively associated with migraine risk. MRVI1 showed protective effects at the protein level but had the opposite effect at the gene expression level. Mediation analysis revealed that the glutamate to pyruvate ratio and 3-CMPFP mediated PNKP's effects on migraine. PheWAS indicated associations between PNKP and body composition traits, suggesting drug safety considerations. PNKP and MRVI1 exhibit dual mechanisms of action at the gene and protein levels, potentially involving distinct mechanistic pathways. Among them, PNKP emerges as a promising drug target for migraine treatment, supported by multi-layered validation.",The journal of headache and pain,2024,"Humans; Migraine Disorders; Brain; Quantitative Trait Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study; Male; Female; Cohort Studies; Adult; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Middle Aged; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases",False,9

A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was employed in this study, utilizing the inverse-variance weighted method as the primary research method. This MR analysis analyzed data of 3022 colorectal cancer cases and 174,006 controls from the FinnGen database. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with unhealthy lifestyle factors were selected as instrumental variables (IVs), including two obesity-related indicators, BMI (body mass index) and WHR (waist-to-hip ratio). Four phenotypes of smoking (smoking initiation, ever smoked, smoking per day, smoking cessation) and one phenotype of alcohol consumption (drinks per week). Four phenotypes of physical activity (accelerometer-based physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, vigorous physical activity, strenuous sports or other exercises). All SNPs were obtained from published genome-wide association studies. The study found that the obesity-related indicator, higher WHR (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.12-1.70; P = 0.002) were associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, and two smoking phenotypes, cigarettes per day(OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.01-1.68; P = 0.042)and smoking initiation (OR = 3.48, 95% CI 1.15-10.55; P = 0.028), were potentially associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. However, there was no evidence to suggest that physical activities and alcohol consumption were associated with colorectal cancer (all p > 0.05). In addition, the study detected no pleiotropy (all p > 0.05).

FinnGen,38403592,Unraveling the causality between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and its common comorbidities using bidirectional Mendelian randomization.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently coexists with various diseases, yet the causal relationship between COPD and these comorbidities remains ambiguous. As a result, the aim of our study is to elucidate the potential causality between COPD and its common comorbidities. We employed the Mendelian randomization (MR) method to analyze single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of common comorbidities with COPD from FinnGen and Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) databases. Causality was primarily assessed using the inverse variance weighting (IVW) method. Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analysis was also conducted to eliminate the interference of smoking-related phenotypes. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure the reliability of our findings. Preliminary univariable MR revealed an increased risk of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) (IVW: OR = 1.757, 95% CI = 1.162-2.657, P = 0.008), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (IVW: OR = 1.193, 95% CI = 1.072-1.326, P < 0.001), chronic periodontitis (IVW: OR = 1.213, 95% CI = 1.038-1.417, P = 0.012), and heart failure (HF) (IVW: OR = 1.127, 95% CI = 1.043-1.218, P = 0.002). Additionally, the reverse MR analysis indicated that genetic susceptibility to HF (IVW: OR = 1.272, 95% CI = 1.084-1.493, P = 0.003), obesity (IVW: OR = 1.128, 95% CI = 1.056-1.205, P < 0.001), depression (IVW: OR = 1.491, 95% CI = 1.257-1.770, P < 0.001), and sleep apnea syndrome (IVW: OR = 1.209, 95% CI = 1.087-1.345, P < 0.001) could raise the risk of COPD. The MVMR analysis showed no causal effect of COPD on susceptibility to chronic periodontitis after adjusting for smoking. Our study identified that COPD may elevate the risk of LUSC, HF, and CKD.

This study aims to explore the causal link between AS and T2DM, as well as its impact on traits related to glucose metabolism. To infer a causal relationship between AS and various diabetes-related traits, including type 1 diabetes (T1DM), T2DM, blood glucose levels, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and fasting insulin, we employed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. We sourced GWAS summary data for both exposure and outcome variables from the IEU OpenGWAS database, GWAS Catalog, and FinnGen database. To synthesize the results of the MR analyses, we applied meta-analysis techniques using either a fixed or random effects model. For identifying and excluding instrumental variants (IVs) that exhibit horizontal pleiotropy with the outcomes, we utilized the MR-PRESSO method. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using the MR-Egger method, along with Q and I^2 tests, to ensure the robustness of our findings.

A bidirectional 2-sample MR framework was applied to investigate causal relationships between OPG, RANK, RANKL, and scoliosis, with inverse variance weighting (IVW) as the main analytical method. Meta-analysis was used to integrate findings across cohorts, and multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness and reliability of the results. According to the IVW results, there was no significant causal relationship between RANK (OR = 0.973, 95% CI = 0.871-1.087, P = .626) and RANKL (OR = 1.048, 95% CI = 0.938-1.171, P = .411) and scoliosis. OPG is a potential protective factor for scoliosis (Folkersen 2020 OR = 0.739, 95% CI = 0.611-0.893, P = .002; Zhao 2023 OR = 0.833, 95% CI = 0.716-0.968, P = .017).The results of Meta-analysis also showed OPG (P = 1.428e-4) would reduce the risk of scoliosis. Inverse MR analysis showed no statistically significant causal relationship between scoliosis and RANK, RANKL and OPG levels (P > .05). Our study employing MR methodology provides robust evidence supporting a causal relationship between decreased osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels and increased susceptibility to scoliosis. However, no significant relationship was found between scoliosis with the RANK-RANKL-OPG system. This research establishes a basis for further exploration of the pathophysiological mechanisms and potential targeted treatments for scoliosis. Future studies are necessary to understand how OPG influences the development of scoliosis.",Medicine,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; RANK Ligand; Scoliosis; Osteoprotegerin; Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B; Genome-Wide Association Study; Female; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Middle Aged",False,0
FinnGen,39558015,A cross-tissue transcriptome-wide association study reveals GRK4 as a novel susceptibility gene for COPD.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent respiratory disorder with environmental factors being the primary risk determinants. However, genetic factors also substantially contribute to the susceptibility and progression of COPD. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several loci associated with COPD susceptibility, the specific pathogenic genes underlying these loci, along with their biological functions and roles within regulatory networks, remain unclear. This lack of clarity constrains our ability to achieve a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of COPD. This study leveraged the FinnGen R11 genetic dataset, comprising 21,617 cases and 372,627 controls, along with GTEx V8 eQTLs data to conduct a cross-tissue transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). Initially, we performed a cross-tissue TWAS analysis using the Unified Test for Molecular Signatures (UTMOST), followed by validation of the UTMOST findings in single tissues using the Functional Summary-based Imputation (FUSION) method and conditional and joint (COJO) analyses of the identified genes. Subsequently, candidate susceptibility genes were screened using Multi-marker Analysis of Genomic Annotation (MAGMA). The causal relationship between these candidate genes and COPD was further evaluated through summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR), colocalization analysis, and Mendelian randomization (MR). Additionally, the identified results were validated against the COPD dataset in the GWAS Catalog (GCST90399694). GeneMANIA was employed to further explore the functional significance of these susceptibility genes. In the cross-tissue TWAS analysis (UTMOST), we identified 17 susceptibility genes associated with COPD. Among these, a novel susceptibility gene, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4 (GRK4), was validated through single-tissue TWAS (FUSION) and MAGMA analyses, with further confirmation via SMR, MR, and colocalization analyses. Moreover, GRK4 was validated in an independent dataset. This study identifies GRK4 as a potential novel susceptibility gene for COPD, which may influence disease risk by exacerbating inflammatory responses. The findings address gaps in previous single-tissue GWAS studies, revealing consistent expression and potential function of GRK4 across different tissues. However, considering the study's limitations, further investigation and validation of GRK4's role in COPD are warranted.",Scientific reports,2024,"Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Humans; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Transcriptome; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Gene Expression Profiling; Male; Female",False,9

This study employed a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the causal relationship between systemic inflammatory regulators and these two common neuropathic pain conditions. In this study, 41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PHN and TN were selected as instrumental variables (IVs) representing systemic inflammatory regulators. Genetic associations of systemic inflammatory regulators were derived from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the human proteome and cytokines. Genetic data related to PHN and TN were obtained from the FinnGen. The primary analytical method utilized inverse variance weighting (IVW) and various sensitivity analyses. Prior to applying the false discovery rate (FDR) correction, our bidirectional MR analysis revealed that increased levels of IFNγ (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.24-0.87, P This study found that certain systemic inflammatory regulators are associated with PHN and TN to some extent.

This study aimed to investigate the causal role of 25(OH)D concentrations, calcium concentrations, and dietary supplements use of vitamin D and calcium on risk of AMD and its subtypes. Independent genetic variants associated with 25(OH)D and calcium concentrations were used as instrumental variables in published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of European ancestry. The bidirectional 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed using summary-level data from the UK Biobank and FinnGen datasets. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure the robustness of the MR results. The meta-analyses were conducted using both fixed-effect and random-effect models to provide comprehensive and reliable estimates. A standard deviation increase in calcium concentrations was linked to a 14%, 17%, and 13% reduction in the likelihood of developing AMD (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77, 0.97), wet AMD (95% CI: 0.73, 0.95), and dry AMD (95% CI: 0.75, 1.00), respectively. No significant causal relationships were detected between genetically predicted 25(OH)D concentrations and AMD and its subtypes (all P > 0.05). The combined analyses showed that higher calcium concentrations were associated with a reduced risk of overall AMD, with an odds ratio of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.98).

FinnGen,38416767,Potential association of genetically predicted lipid and lipid-modifying drugs with rheumatoid arthritis: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Past studies have demonstrated that patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often exhibit abnormal levels of lipids. Furthermore, certain lipid-modifying medications have shown effectiveness in alleviating clinical symptoms associated with RA. However, the current understanding of the causal relationship between lipids, lipid-modifying medications, and the risk of developing RA remains inconclusive. This study employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal connection between lipids, lipid-modifying drugs, and the occurrence of RA. We obtained genetic variation for lipid traits and drug targets related to lipid modification from three sources: the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC), UK Biobank, and Nightingale Health 2020. The genetic data for RA were acquired from two comprehensive meta-analyses and the R8 of FINNGEN, respectively. These variants were employed in drug-target MR analyses to establish a causal relationship between genetically predicted lipid-modifying drug targets and the risk of RA. For suggestive lipid-modified drug targets, we conducted Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analyses and using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data in relevant tissues. In addition, we performed co-localization analyses to assess genetic confounders. Our analysis revealed no significant causal relationship between lipid and RA. We observed that the genetically predicted 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) -mediated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (OR 0.704; 95% CI 0.56, 0.89; P = 3.43×10-3), Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) -mediated triglyceride (TG) (OR 0.844; 95% CI 0.77, 0.92; P = 1.50×10-4) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) -mediated LDL-C (OR 0.835; 95% CI 0.73, 0.95; P = 8.81×10-3) were significantly associated with a lowered risk of RA. while Apolipoprotein B-100 (APOB) -mediated LDL-C (OR 1.212; 95%CI 1.05,1.40; P = 9.66×10-3) was significantly associated with an increased risk of RA.

In this study, we utilized genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics from the UK Biobank and SUNLIGHT consortium for serum vitamin D levels, as well as urolithiasis data from FinnGen. We employed bidirectional two-sample MR analysis to evaluate potential causal relationships. The primary MR analysis relied on the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, supplemented by MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode approaches. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure result robustness, including Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, leave-one-out tests, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test. The MR analysis indicated no significant causal effects of serum 25(OH)D levels on urolithiasis [IVW method: (kidney and ureteral stones: OR = 1.134;95% CI, 0.953 to 1.350, p = 0.155; lower urinary tract stones: OR = 1.158; 95% CI, 0.806 to 1.666, p = 0.428)]. However, according to the IVW results, genetically predicted kidney and ureteral stones were associated with decreased serum 25(OH)D levels (beta = -0.025; 95% CI, -0.048 to -0.003; p = 0.028), while they did not indicate a causal effect of lower urinary tract stones on serum 25(OH)D levels (beta = -0.002; 95% CI, -0.013 to -0.008; p = 0.662). A sensitivity analysis suggested the robustness of these causal associations. Our MR study did not provide evidence supporting a causal association between serum 25(OH)D levels and urolithiasis among individuals of European descent.

FinnGen,39490725,Integrative multiomic analysis unveils the molecular nexus of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but its mechanisms and related molecular networks remain unclear. We explored the association between mitochondrial-related genes and AMD by integrating multiomic data. We acquired summary-level data on mitochondrial-related protein abundance, gene expression, and gene methylation from quantitative trait locus studies. Genetic associations with AMD were sourced from the International Age-related Macular Degeneration Genomics Consortium (discovery), FinnGen (replication), and UK Biobank (replication) studies. We used summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to assess the correlations between mitochondrial-related gene molecular characteristics and AMD. Furthermore, colocalization analysis was performed to ascertain if the detected signal pairings had a common causative genetic variation. Mitochondrial-related gene NFKB1 demonstrated a protective role in AMD (tier 1 evidence), whereas HSPA1A and HSPA1B genes were also associated with decreased AMD risk (tier 2 evidence). The methylation of cg09390974 and cg15409712 in NFKB1 was associated with increased NFKB1 expression, consistent with the protective effect on AMD risk, whereas inverse associations were observed between gene methylation and gene expression for HSPA1B (cg04835051 and cg16372051), supporting the risk roles of methylation in AMD. At circulating protein level, genetically predicted higher levels of HSPA1A (odds ratio [OR] 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19-0.41, P < 0.001), HSPA1B (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.06-0.27, P < 0.001), and NFKB1 (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27-0.68, P < 0.001) were inversely associated with AMD risk.

In this study, we utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to assess the influence of HDPs on the future risks of ovarian, cervical, endometrial, and breast cancer and uterine fibroids, controlling for confounding factors. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data relevant to HDPs was obtained from the FinnGen databases (10,736 cases and 136,325 controls). Gynecologic tumor outcomes were extracted from the IEU Open GWAS project and UK Biobank (47,690 cases and 1, 092,073 controls).

Unfortunately, there are few effective treatment options available. Mendelian randomization (MR) has been utilized to repurpose existing drugs and identify new therapeutic targets. The objective of this study is to identify novel therapeutic targets for COPD. Cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) were extracted for 4,317 identified druggable genes from genomics and proteomics data of whole blood (eQTLGen) and lung tissue (GTEx Consortium). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data for doctor-diagnosed COPD, spirometry-defined COPD (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second [FEV1]/Forced Vital Capacity [FVC] <0.7), and FEV1 were obtained from the cohort of FinnGen, UK Biobank and SpiroMeta consortium. We employed Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR), HEIDI test, and colocalization analysis to assess the causal effects of druggable gene expression on COPD and lung function. The reliability of these druggable genes was confirmed by eQTL two-sample MR and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) SMR, respectively. The potential effects of druggable genes were assessed through the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). Information on drug repurposing for COPD was collected from multiple databases. A total of 31 potential druggable genes associated with doctor-diagnosed COPD, spirometry-defined COPD, and FEV1 were identified through SMR, HEIDI test, and colocalization analysis. Among them, 22 genes (e.g., MMP15, PSMA4, ERBB3, and LMCD1) were further confirmed by eQTL two-sample MR and protein SMR analyses. Gene-level PheWAS revealed that ERBB3 expression might reduce inflammation, while GP9 and MRC2 were associated with other traits. The drugs Montelukast (targeting the MMP15 gene) and MARIZOMIB (targeting the PSMA4 gene) may reduce the risk of spirometry-defined COPD. Additionally, an existing small molecule inhibitor of the APH1A gene has the potential to increase FEV Our findings identified 22 potential drug targets for COPD and lung function.

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between depression and infertility using Mendelian randomization (MR) and cross-sectional study, and to explore the potential mediating role of obesity. The cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2018. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was used to assess the association between depression and infertility risk, and mediation analysis was to examine the mediating effect of obesity. Then, we performed MR analyses to investigate the causal effect of depression on infertility. Instrumental variables for depression were obtained from a genome-wide association meta-analysis (135,458 cases and 344,901 controls), and summary level data for infertility were obtained from the FinnGen database (6,481 cases and 68,969 controls). In the cross-sectional study, a total of 2,915 participants between the ages of 18 and 45 were included, of whom 389 were infertile. We observed that depression was strongly associated with an increased risk of infertility (OR=1.66, 95%CI: 1.19, 2.33), and this relationship remained significant in mild (OR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.93), moderate (OR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.26, 2.84), and severe depression (OR=1.74, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.99). Mediation analysis showed that obesity mediated 7.15% and 15.91% of the relationship between depression and infertility for body mass index and waist circumference. Furthermore, depression significantly increased the risk of infertility in both the general obesity (OR=1.81, 95%CI=1.20-2.73, P<0.01) and abdominal obesity populations (OR=1.57, 95%CI=1.08-2.27, P=0.02) populations.

This work employed cis expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for 2,200 druggable genes from the eQTLGen Consortium and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data for telomere length in seven blood cell types from the UK Biobank, Netherlands Cohort as exposures. GWAS data for lymphoid leukemia (LL) and myeloid leukemia (ML) from FinnGen and Lee Lab were used as outcomes for discovery and replication cohorts, respectively. Robust Mendelian randomization (MR) findings were generated from seven MR models and a series of sensitivity analyses. Summary-data-based MR (SMR) analysis and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) were further implemented to verify the association between identified druggable genes and leukemia. Single-cell type expression analysis was employed to identify the specific expression of leukemia casual genes on human bone marrow and peripheral blood immune cells. Multivariable MR analysis, linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), and Bayesian colocalization analysis were performed to further validate the relationship between telomere length and leukemia. Mediation analysis was used to assess the effects of identified druggable genes affecting leukemia via telomere length. Phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR) analysis for assessing the effect of leukemia causal genes and telomere length on 1,403 disease phenotypes. Combining the results of the meta-analysis for MR estimates from two cohorts, SMR and TWAS analysis, we identified five LL causal genes (TYMP, DSTYK, PPIF, GDF15, FAM20A) and three ML causal genes (LY75, ADA, ABCA2) as promising drug targets for leukemia. Univariable MR analysis showed genetically predicted higher leukocyte telomere length increased the risk of LL (odds ratio [OR] = 2.33, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 1.70-3.18; P = 1.33E-07), and there was no heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. Evidence from the meta-analysis of two cohorts strengthened this finding (OR = 1.88, 95 % CI 1.06-3.05; P = 0.01). Multivariable MR analysis showed the causality between leukocyte telomere length and LL without interference from the other six blood cell telomere length (OR = 2.72, 95 % CI 1.88-3.93; P = 1.23E-07). Evidence from LDSC supported the positive genetic correlation between leukocyte telomere length and LL (r Our study identified several druggable genes associated with leukemia risk and provided new insights into the etiology and drug development of leukemia.

We aimed to investigate causal relationships between circulating cytokine levels and the development of these diseases. Genetic instrumental variables for circulating cytokines were derived from a genome-wide association study of 8293 European participants. Summary-level data for AMD, glaucoma, and senile cataract were obtained from the FinnGen database. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) was the main Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis method. The Cochran's Q, MR-Egger regression, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier test were used for sensitivity analysis. Based on the IVW method, MR analysis demonstrated five circulating cytokines suggestively associated with AMD (SCGF-β, 1.099 [95%CI, 1.037-1.166], P = 0.002; SCF, 1.155 [95%CI, 1.015-1.315], P = 0.029; MCP-1, 1.103 [95%CI, 1.012-1.202], P = 0.026; IL-10, 1.102 [95%CI, 1.012-1.200], P = 0.025; eotaxin, 1.086 [95%CI, 1.002-1.176], P = 0.044), five suggestively linked with glaucoma (MCP-1, 0.945 [95%CI, 0.894-0.999], P = 0.047; IL1ra, 0.886 [95%CI, 0.809-0.969], P = 0.008; IL-1β, 0.866 [95%CI, 0.762-0.983], P = 0.027; IL-9, 0.908 [95%CI, 0.841-0.980], P = 0.014; IL2ra, 1.065 [95%CI, 1.004-1.130], P = 0.035), and four suggestively associated with senile cataract (TRAIL, 1.043 [95%CI, 1.009-1.077], P = 0.011; IL-16, 1.032 [95%CI, 1.001-1.064], P = 0.046; IL1ra, 0.942 [95%CI, 0.887-0.999], P = 0.047; FGF-basic, 1.144 [95%CI, 1.052-1.244], P = 0.002).

Nevertheless, the specific inflammatory regulators involved in this pathogenesis remain unclear. We systematically explored circulating inflammatory proteins that are causally associated with T2D via a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study and further investigated them in prevalent complications of T2D. Genetic instruments for 91 circulating inflammatory proteins were derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that enrolled 14,824 predominantly European participants. Regarding the summary-level GWASs of type 2 diabetes, we adopted the largest meta-analysis of European population (74,124 cases vs. 824,006 controls) and a prospective nested case-cohort study in Europe (9,978 cases vs. 12,348 controls). Summary statistics for five complications of T2D were acquired from the FinnGen R9 repository. The inverse variance-weighted method was applied as the primary method for causal inference. MR-Egger, weighted median and maximum likelihood methods were employed as supplementary analyses. Results from the two T2D studies were combined in a meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses and phenotype-wide association studies (PheWAS) were performed to detect heterogeneity and potential horizontal pleiotropy in the study. Genetic evidence indicated that elevated levels of TGF-α (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.15-1.17) and CX3CL1 (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.04-1.63) promoted the occurrence of T2D, and increased concentrations of FGF-21 (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.81-0.93) and hGDNF (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.95-0.98) mitigated the risk of developing T2D, while type 2 diabetes did not exert a significant influence on said proteins. Elevated levels of TGF-α were associated with an increased risk of ketoacidosis, neurological complications, and ocular complications in patients with T2D, and increased concentrations of FGF-21 were potentially correlated with a diminished risk of T2D with neurological complications. Higher levels of hGDNF were associated with an increased risk of T2D with peripheral vascular complications, while CX3CL1 did not demonstrate a significant association with T2D complications. Sensitivity analyses and PheWAS further ensure the robustness of our findings.

In this proof of principle study, we investigated if genetic liability for schizophrenia is associated with high dose requirements of antipsychotics and antipsychotic polypharmacy, using real-world registry and biobank data from five independent Nordic cohorts of a total of N = 21,572 individuals with psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other psychosis). Within regression models, a polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia was studied in relation to standardized antipsychotic dose as well as antipsychotic polypharmacy, defined based on longitudinal prescription registry data as well as health records and self-reported data. Meta-analyses across the five cohorts showed that PRS for schizophrenia was significantly positively associated with prescribed (standardized) antipsychotic dose (beta(SE) = 0.0435(0.009), p = 0.0006) and antipsychotic polypharmacy defined as taking ≥2 antipsychotics (OR = 1.10, CI = 1.05-1.21, p = 0.0073).

FinnGen,37899293,Increased risk of dementia differs across cardiovascular diseases and types of dementia - Data from a nationwide study.,"Dementia is a major health problem. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and risk factors are associated with incident dementia. However, whether there is an association among CVD, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) at the population level remains unclear. We analysed the association between CVD (heart failure [HF], atrial fibrillation [AF], myocardial infarction [MI], peripheral arterial disease, stroke and transient ischemic attack) and the incidence of dementia using nationwide FinnGen data of 218,192 individuals. The last follow-up information on dementia was available from October 2021. The age at the end of the follow-up was 61.7 ± 17.1 years, and 53% were women. Overall, we observed 9701 (4.4%) dementia, 6323 (2.9%) AD and 1918 (0.7%) VD cases. Individuals with CVD had a higher risk of developing dementia than unexposed individuals. In the multivariable-adjusted Cox models, stroke was most strongly associated with dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-1.8). CVD was more strongly associated with VD than with AD. Individuals with HF and MI had an increased risk of AD (HF: HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.19; MI: HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18). AF was associated with VD (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.42-1.77), but not with AD (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97-1.09). Clinical characteristics, such as diabetes, smoking and alcohol abuse, were associated with both types of dementia. All major CVDs were associated with an increased risk of developing dementia, particularly VD.

FinnGen,37505304,Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and the risk of valvular heart disease: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies have suggested that immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are associated with a higher risk of valvular heart disease (VHD). But the potential causal association is not clear. Therefore, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causal association of IMIDs with VHD risk. A two-sample MR analysis was performed to confirm the causal association of several common IMIDs (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE; rheumatoid arthritis, RA; multiple sclerosis, MS; ankylosing spondylitis, AS; psoriasis, PSO; inflammatory bowel disease, IBD) with the risk of VHD. The exposure data is derived from published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and outcome data come from the FinnGen database (47,003 cases and 182,971 controls). Inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median methods were performed to assess the causal association. The study design applied univariable MR and multivariable MR. The MR analysis indicated that several genetically predicted IMIDs increased the risk of VHD, including SLE (odds ratio (OR) = 1.014; 95% confidence interval (CI) =  < 1.001,1.028 > ; p = 0.036), RA (OR = 1.017; 95% CI =  < 1.002,1.031 > ; p = 0.025), and IBD (OR = 1.018; 95% CI =  < 1.002,1.033 > ; p = 0.023). Multivariable MR indicated that the adverse effect of these IMIDs on VHD was dampened to varying degrees after adjusting for smoking, obesity, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. Our findings support the first genetic evidence of the causality of genetically predicted IMIDs with the risk of developing into VHD. Our results deliver a viewpoint that further active intervention needs to be explored to mitigate VHD risk in patients with SLE, RA, and IBD. Key Points • Genetically predicted systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are causally associated with valvular heart disease (VHD). • To reduce the risk of VHD in patients with SLE, RA, and IBD, active interventions should be further explored.",Clinical rheumatology,2024,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Heart Valve Diseases; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Immunomodulating Agents; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,7
FinnGen,39654255,Development and application of a predictive model for survival and drug therapy based on COVID-19-related lncRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Numerous studies have substantiated the pivotal role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the prognosis of afflicted patients. Notably, individuals with NSCLC may exhibit heightened vulnerability to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), resulting in a more unfavorable prognosis subsequent to infection. Nevertheless, the impact of COVID-19-related lncRNAs on NSCLC remains unexplored. The aim of our study was to develop an innovative model that leverages COVID-19-related lncRNAs to optimize the prognosis of NSCLC patients. Pertinent genes and patient data were procured from reputable databases, including TCGA, Finngen, and RGD. Through co-expression analysis, we identified lncRNAs associated with COVID-19. Subsequently, we employed univariate, LASSO, and multivariate COX regression techniques to construct a risk model based on these COVID-19-related lncRNAs. The validity of the risk model was assessed using KM analysis, PCA, and ROC. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis was conducted to elucidate the functional pathways linked to the identified lncRNAs. Lastly, we performed TME analysis and predicted the drug sensitivity of the model. Based on risk scores, patients were categorized into high- and low-risk subgroups, revealing distinct clinicopathological factors, immune pathways, and chemotherapy sensitivity between the subgroups. Four COVID-19-related lncRNAs (AL161431.1, AC079949.1, AC123595.1, and AC108136.1) were identified as potential candidates for constructing prognostic prediction models for NSCLC. We also observed a positive correlation between risk score and MDSC, exclusion, and CAF. Additionally, two immune pathways associated with high-risk and low-risk subgroups were identified. Our findings further support the association between COVID-19 infection and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, as well as steroid metabolism in NSCLC. Moreover, we identified several highly sensitive chemotherapy drugs for NSCLC treatment. The developed model holds significant value in predicting the prognosis of NSCLC patients and guiding treatment decisions.",Medicine,2024,"Humans; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; RNA, Long Noncoding; COVID-19; Lung Neoplasms; Prognosis; SARS-CoV-2; Male; Female",False,9

However, the causality remains ambiguous. This study aimed to determine whether frailty index is causally associated with chronic kidney disease. We obtained the frailty genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and chronic kidney disease GWAS data from the FinnGen R5 (total n = 216,743; case = 3902, control = 212,841) as the exposure and outcome, respectively. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was primarily conducted using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median and MR-Egger regression analyses. Multivariable MR analysis (MVMR) was conducted for additional adjustment. In the two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses, a total of 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were recognized as effective instrumental variables. The IVW method showed evidence to support a causal association between frailty index and chronic kidney disease (beta = 1.270; 95% CI 0.608 to 1.931; P < 0.001). MR-Egger revealed a causal association between frailty index and chronic kidney disease (beta = 3.612; 95% CI 0.805 to 6.419; P = 0.027). MR-Egger regression revealed that directional pleiotropy was unlikely to be biasing the result (intercept =  - 0.053; P = 0.119). The weighted median approach and weighted mode method also demonstrated a causal association between frailty index and chronic kidney disease (beta = 1.148; 95% CI 0.278 to 2.019; P = 0.011; beta = 2.194; 95% CI 0.598 to 3.790; P = 0.018). Cochran's Q test and the funnel plot indicated no directional pleiotropy.

However, it remains controversial whether PCOS is an essential risk factor for these adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. We aimed to use instrumental variables in a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to determine causality between PCOS and adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. Summary statistics were extracted from a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis conducted in PCOS, which included 10,074 cases and 103,164 controls of European ancestry. Data on Adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were summarized from the FinnGen database of European ancestry, which included more than 180,000 samples. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method of MR was applied for the main outcome. To assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy, we conducted sensitivity analyses, including leave-one-out analysis, weighted median, MR-PRESSO (Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier), and MR-Egger regression. Two-sample MR analysis with the IVW method suggested that PCOS exerted causal effects on the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) 1.170, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.051-1.302, p = 0.004], in particular gestational hypertension (OR 1.083, 95% CI 1.007-1.164, p = 0.031), but not other pregnancy and perinatal diseases (all  We confirmed a causal relationship between PCOS and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, in particular gestational hypertension, but no association with any other adverse pregnancy or perinatal outcome.

This study used a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to look into the causal relationship between MMPs and the risk of TAA and AAA. Eight MMPs, including MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, MMP-12, and MMP-13, were found among people of European ancestry with accessible Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). We employed the findings from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) for 8 MMPs, and TAA and AAA from the FinnGen consortiums (3,201 cases and 317,899 controls, respectively) were used in a two-sample MR analysis. The primary method of analysis for MR was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, along with analyses of heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. 31 single-nucleotide polymorphisms connected to MMP were retrieved. IVW demonstrated a negative causal association between TAA and AAA and serum MMP-12 levels. The incidence of TAA decreased by 1.031% for every 1 ng/mL increase in serum MMP-12 [odds ratio (OR) = 0.897, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.831-0.968, P = 0.005].

To systematically review the associations of common single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and rare coding variants with primary angle-closure disease, its subtypes (including primary angle-closure glaucoma, primary angle-closure suspect, and primary angle-closure) and progression. Eligible studies from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were retrieved up to April 3, 2023. SNV information was extracted from eligible reports and 2 genome-wide association studies summary statistics, UK BioBank and FinnGen. Studies providing analyzable genotype or allele data in a case-control design for primary angle-closure disease association and longitudinal case-only design for primary angle-closure disease progression. PRISMA guidelines were used for literature screening and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for data quality assessment. Pooled effect size with 95% CIs of SNV associations were calculated using fixed- or random-effect models according to I2 statistics. SNVs reported in 2 or more studies were meta-analyzed to generate pooled odds ratios and P values. Common and rare coding variants from single reports were summarized. Sixty-nine citations were eligible for meta-analysis on overall primary angle-closure disease, involving 206 SNVs in 64 genes or loci. Seventeen SNVs in 15 genes or loci showed associations with primary angle-closure disease, and 15 SNVs in 13 genes or loci showed associations with primary angle-closure glaucoma. Two SNVs, ABCA1 rs2422493 and ZNRF3 rs3178915, were associated only with primary angle-closure disease. Two SNVs, PCMTD1-ST18 rs1015213 and COL11A1 rs3753841, were associated with primary angle-closure suspect, and 1 SNV, MMP9 rs3918249, was associated with primary angle-closure. This systematic review and meta-analysis newly confirmed 7 genes or loci associated with primary angle-closure glaucoma: ATOH7, CALCRL, FBN1, IL6, LOXL1, MMP19, and VAV3. Common and rare coding variants in 16 genes or loci that have been associated with primary angle-closure disease were cataloged. Stratification analysis revealed different primary angle-closure disease-associated genes in different ethnic populations. Only 1 study regarding the genetic association of primary angle-closure glaucoma progression was identified. This study revealed the genetic complexity of primary angle-closure disease, involving common SNVs and rare coding variants in more than 30 genes or loci, with ethnic and phenotypic diversities.

FinnGen,38413695,Associations of hyperthyroidism with epilepsy: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Prior studies have revealed an increased susceptibility to epilepsy in hyperthyroid individuals, but the genetic basis of the hyperthyroidism-epilepsy relationship is not fully comprehended, prompting this study to explore this potential association. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) study to explore the relationship between hyperthyroidism and epilepsy by utilizing aggregated statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). Data for hyperthyroidism were derived from a GWAS encompassing 462,933 participants, while epilepsy data were sourced from the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) consortium. Five distinct methods were employed for TSMR analysis, which included the inverse variance weighting method, MR Egger method, weighted median method, simple model, and weighted model. In our sensitivity analysis, we employed the MR Egger and MR PRESSO methods to assess pleiotropy, and inverse variance weighting and MR Egger in Cochran's Q statistics to assess heterogeneity. In the IEU database, utilizing the MR-Egger method, we obtained an odds ratio (OR) of 2.631 (95% CI 0.608, 9.796) with a p-value of 0.122. Meanwhile, employing the Weighted Median method yielded an OR of 1.813 (95% CI 0.786, 4.181) with a p-value of 0.163. The IVW method exhibited an OR of 1.986 (95% CI 1.127, 3.502) with a p-value of 0.018. In the assessment of heterogeneity, the MR-Egger method produced a Q statistic of 65.205, accompanied by a p-value of 0.087, while the IVW method recorded a Q statistic of 66.668 with a p-value of 0.083. The multifactorial analysis results showed an intercept term with a standard error (SE) value of 0.009 and a p-value of 0.291. In the FinnGen database, employing the MR-Egger method for all epilepsy data, we observed an OR of 0.952 (95% CI 0.831, 1.093) with a p-value of 0.539. Simultaneously, the Weighted Median method produced an OR of 0.986 (95% CI 0.953, 1.021) with a p-value of 0.423. The IVW method indicated an OR of 0.992 (95% CI 0.965, 1.019) with a p-value of 0.541.

Despite substantial efforts to identify causes and risk factors for NHL, its aetiology is largely unclear. Autoimmune diseases have long been considered potential risk factors for NHL. We carried out Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses to examine whether genetically predicted susceptibility to ten autoimmune diseases (Behçet's disease, coeliac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, lupus, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes) is associated with risk of NHL. Two-sample MR was performed using publicly available summary statistics from cohorts of European ancestry. For NHL and four NHL subtypes, we used data from UK Biobank, Kaiser Permanente cohorts, and FinnGen studies. Negative associations between type 1 diabetes and sarcoidosis and the risk of NHL were observed (odds ratio [OR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92-0.98, p = 5 × 10 These findings suggest that genetically predicted susceptibility to type 1 diabetes, and to some extent sarcoidosis, might reduce the risk of NHL.

We selected summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (n = 14 824) on 91 inflammatory factors, with PCa as the outcome in the latest 9th edition of FinnGen database for MR analysis. We evaluated the causal relationship between inflammatory factors and PCa using the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of such regression models as inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger regression, simple mode (SM), weighted mode (WM) and weighted median estimator (WME), with IVW as the main statistical method for this study. We further verified the results of MR by Bayesian analysis, and evaluated the heterogeneity of genetic instrumental variables, pleiotropic effects and sensitivity of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) as instrumental variables to the exposure-outcome relationship by Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test and leave-one-out cross validation. IVW showed that among the 91 inflammatory factors, interleukin-22 receptor A1 (IL-22RA1) and sulfotransferase 1A1 (ST1A1) were correlated positively with the risk of PCa； IL-22RA1：IVW（OR ［95% CI］: 1.12 ［1.00－1.25］, P = 0.04）；ST1A1：IVW（OR ［95% CI］: 1.08 (1.00－1.16), P = 0. 03）, while Chemokine ligand 11 (CXCL11) and interleukin 17 A (IL-17 A) negatively with the risk of PCa； CXCL11：IVW（OR ［95% CI］: 0.88 ［0.81－0.95］, P = 0.00）；IL-17A：IVW（OR ［95% CI］: 0.91 ［0.84－0.98］, P = 0.02）.

Observational studies have indicated that diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for CRAO; however, there is no research on the causal relationship between diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes, and CRAO. This study aimed to perform Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to clarify the causal relationship between type 2 diabetes and CRAO. Genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes were selected from two different datasets. A recent genome-wide association study of CRAO conducted using the FinnGen database was used as the outcome data. A two-sample MR was performed to evaluate the causal relationship between type 2 diabetes and CRAO. Inverse variance weighting was the primary method, and MR-Egger, maximum likelihood, and median weighting were used as complementary methods. A multivariate MR (MVMR) analysis was performed to further evaluate the robustness of the results.

FinnGen,38953300,Association between gut microbiota and malignant cardiac tumors: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Recent studies provide compelling evidence linking the gut microbiota to most cancers. Nevertheless, further research is required to establish a definitive causal relationship between the gut microbiota and malignant cardiac tumors. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data on the human gut Microbiota, included in the IEU Open GWAS project, was initially collected by the MiBioGen consortium. It encompasses 14,306 individuals and comprises a total of 5,665,279 SNPs. Similarly, the GWAS data on malignant cardiac tumors, also sourced from the IEU Open GWAS project, was initially stored in the finnGen database, including 16,380,303 SNPs observed within a cohort of 174,108 individuals within the European population. Utilizing a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) methodology, we examined whether there exists a causal association between the gut microbiota and cardiac tumors. Additionally, to bolster the credibility and robustness of the identified causal relationships, we conducted an extensive array of sensitivity analyses, encompassing Cochran's Q test, MR-PRESSO tests, MR-Egger interpret test, directionality test and leave-one-out analysis. Our analysis unveiled seven distinct causal associations between genetic susceptibility in the gut microbiota and the incidence of malignant cardiac tumors. Among these, the Family Rikenellaceae, genus Eubacterium brachy group, and genus Ruminococcaceae UCG009 exhibited an elevated risk of cardiac tumors, while the phylum Verrucomicrobia, genus Lactobacillus, genus Ruminiclostridium5, and an unknown genus id.1868 were genetically linked to a reduced risk of cardiac tumors. The causal relationship between these two bacteria, belonging to the phylum Verrucomicrobia (OR = 0.178, 95% CI: 0.052-0.614, p = 0.006) and the genus Ruminococcaceae UCG009 (OR = 3.071, 95% CI: 1.236-7.627, p = 0.016), and cardiac tumors was further validated through sensitivity analyses, reinforcing the robustness and reliability of the observed associations.

FinnGen,38948518,Mendelian randomization study and mediation analysis about the relation of inflammatory bowel disease and diabetic retinopathy: the further exploration of gut-retina axis.,"The concept of the gut-retinal axis proposed by previous scholars primarily focused on the relationship between intestinal microbiota and retinal diseases, and few further expanded the relationship between intestinal diseases and retinal diseases. To further substantiate the concept of the gut-retinal axis, we analyzed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) using Mendelian randomization (MR), and use mediation analysis to further explore the potential substances that influence this causal relationship. The genome-wide association study's (GWAS) summary statistics for genetic variations were utilized in a Mendelian randomization (MR) investigation. GWAS data on IBD (including ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and IBD) for non-Finnish Europeans (NFE) were sourced from published articles. In contrast, data on DR (including DR and diabetic maculopathy (DMP)) were obtained from FinnGen R9. The causal relationship has been investigated using inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median and sensitivity analysis was applied to verify the stability of the results. In addition, we applied mediation analysis to investigate whether circulating inflammatory proteins and plasma lipids played a mediating role, and calculated its effect ratio. The causal relationship between IBD and DR was discovered by employing the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method and weighted median method. In forward MR, UC was significantly associated with lower risk of DR (IVW: OR=0.874; 95%CI= 0.835-0.916; P value= 1.28E-08) (Weighted median: OR=0.893; 95%CI= 0.837-0.954; P value= 7.40E-04). In reverse MR, it was shown that DR (IVW: OR=0.870; 95%CI= 0.828-0.914; P value= 2.79E-08)(Weighted median: OR=0.857; 95%CI= 0.801-0.916; P value= 6.40E-06) and DMP (IVW: OR=0.900; 95%CI= 0.865-0.937; P value= 3.34E-07)(Weighted median: OR=0.882; 95%CI= 0.841-0.924; P value= 1.82E-07) could reduce the risk of CD. What's more, DR is associated with a lower risk of IBD according to genetic prediction (IVW: OR=0.922; 95%CI= 0.873-0.972; P value= 0.002) (Weighted median: OR=0.924; 95%CI= 0.861-0.992; P value= 0.029). Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and triacylglycerol (TG) serve as mediators in these relationships. Our research offers novel insights and sources for investigating the gut-retina axis in the genetic relationship between IBD and DR.

Aggregate data for 84 Treg-related immune traits were downloaded from the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) catalog, and GWAS data for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n=315243), follicular lymphoma (FL; n=325831), sjögren's syndrome (SS; n=402090), rheumatoid arthritis (RA; n=276465), dermatopolymyositis (DM; n=311640), psoriasis (n=407876), atopic dermatitis (AD; n=382254), ulcerative colitis (UC; n=411317), crohn's disease(CD; n=411973) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; n=307587) were downloaded from the FinnGen database. The inverse variance weighting (IVW) method was mainly used to infer any causal association between Treg-related immune traits and DLBCL, FL, SS, DM, RA, Psoriasis, AD, UC, CD and SLE, supplemented by MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode. Moreover, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the validity of the causal relationships. There was a potential genetic predisposition association identified between CD39+ CD8br AC, CD39+ CD8br % T cell, and the risk of DLBCL (OR=1.51, p<0.001; OR=1.25, p=0.001) (adjusted FDR<0.1). Genetic prediction revealed potential associations between CD25++ CD8br AC, CD28- CD25++ CD8br % T cell, CD39+ CD8br % CD8br, and the risk of FL (OR=1.13, p=0.022; OR=1.28, p=0.042; OR=0.90, p=0.016) (adjusted FDR>0.1). Furthermore, SLE and CD exhibited a genetically predicted potential association with the CD39+ CD8+ Tregs subset. SS and DM were possibly associated with an increase in the quantity of the CD4+ Tregs subset; RA may have reduced the quantity of the CD39+ CD8+ Tregs subset, although no causal relationship was identified. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of our findings. There existed a genetically predicted potential association between the CD39+ CD8+ Tregs subset and the risk of DLBCL, while SLE and CD were genetically predicted to be potentially associated with the CD39+ CD8+ Tregs subset.

FinnGen,38573543,Causal effect of gut microbiota on the risk of prostatitis: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Recent studies demonstrated that chronic prostatitis (CP) is closely related to the gut microbiota (GM). Nevertheless, the causal relationship between GM and CP has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to investigate this association. The summary data of gut microbiota derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 18,340 individuals in the MiBioGen study served as the exposure, and the corresponding summary statistics for CP risk, representing the outcome, were obtained from the FinnGen databases (R9). The causal effects between GM and CP were estimated using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method supplemented with MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode methods. Additionally, the false discovery rate (FDR) correction was performed to adjust results. The detection and quantification of heterogeneity and pleiotropy were accomplished through the MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier method, Cochran's Q statistics, and MR-Egger regression. The IVW estimates indicated that a total of 11 GM taxa were related to the risk of CP. Seven of them was correlated with an increased risk of CP, while the remained linked with a decreased risk of CP. However, only Methanobacteria (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.74-0.99), Methanobacteriales (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.74-0.99), NB1n (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.16-1.34), Methanobacteriaceae (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.74-0.99), Odoribactergenus Odoribacter (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.05-1.94), and Sutterellagenus Sutterella (OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.01-1.76) still maintain significant association with CP after FDR correction. Consistent directional effects for all analyses were observed in the supplementary methods. Subsequently, sensitivity analyses indicated the absence of heterogeneity, directional pleiotropy, or outliers concerning the causal effect of specific gut microbiota on CP (p > 0.05). Our study demonstrated a gut microbiota-prostate axis, offering crucial data supporting the promising use of the GM as a candidate target for CP prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

The summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) and Bayesian co-localization analysis were used to assess the potential causality between AS and relevant genes. The GWAS data obtained from the International Genetics of Ankylosing Spondylitis Consortium (IGAS) were set as the discovery stage, and the FinnGen and UK Biobank databases were used to replicate the analysis as an external validation. We further integrated the multi-omics results to screen overlapped genes at different levels. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and enrichment analyses were used to explore the biological effect of SMR-identified genes on AS. Drug prediction and molecular docking were used to validate the medicinal value of candidate drug targets. Based on the results of multi-omics evidence screening, we identified potential associations of TNFRSF1A, B3GNT2, ERAP1, and FCGR2A with AS at different regulatory levels. At the protein level, AIF1, TNXB, APOM, and B3GNT2 were found to be negatively associated with AS risk, whereas higher levels of FCGR2A, FCGR2B, IL12B, TNFRSF1A, and ERAP1 were associated with an increased risk of AS. The bioinformatics analyses showed that the SMR-identified genes were mainly involved in immune response. Molecular docking results displayed stable binding between predicted candidate drugs and these aforementioned proteins.

FinnGen,37973425,Association between circulating biomarkers and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: An integrative Mendelian randomization study of European ancestry.,"Circulating biomarkers provide potential diagnostic or prognostic information on disease presentation, progression or both. Early detection of circulating risk biomarkers is critical for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevention. We aimed to systematically assess the potential causal relationship of genetically predicted 60 circulatory biomarkers with NAFLD using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design. We extracted instrumental variables for 60 circulating biomarkers, and obtained genome-wide association data for NAFLD from 3 sources [(including Anstee, FinnGen and UK Biobank (N ranges: 19264-377988)] among individuals of European ancestry. Our primary method was inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR, with a series of additional and sensitivity analyses to test the hypothesis of MR. MR results showed that genetically predicted higher density lipoprotein-cholesterol (odds ratio (OR) = 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77-0.96) and vitamin D (OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.19-0.78) levels decreased the risk of NAFLD, whereas genetically predicted higher alanine (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.21-2.33), histidine (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.00-1.46), lactate (OR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.09-6.39), triglycerides (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.05-1.13), ferritin (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.01-1.37), serum iron (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07-1.41) and transferrin saturation (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.05-1.29), component 4 (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01-1.20), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.21) and interleukin-6 (OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.14-2.30) levels increased the risk of NAFLD.

However, the presence and causal direction of this association remain uncertain. Methods We conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analyses utilizing summary statistics derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) consortia. The summary statistics were obtained from a substantial participant cohort, consisting of 116,000 individuals (21,000 AD cases and 95,000 controls), 462,933 individuals (26,107 AR cases and 436,826 controls), and 140,308 individuals (4859 AA cases and 135,449 controls). The summary statistics for PSO (9267 cases and 360,471 controls) and PSA (3186 cases and 240,862 controls) were sourced from the FinnGen database. The primary analytical approach employed inverse variance weighting (IVW) as the main method within TSMR. We validated our findings through a series of sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, we performed reverse TSMR analyses to evaluate the potential presence of reverse causality. Results Our investigation revealed a potential protective effect of AD against both PSO (OR = 0.922, 95% CI = 0.863-0.984, p = 0.015)and PSA(OR = 0.915, 95% CI = 0.843-0.993, p = 0.033). Moreover, employing inverse MR analysis, we obtained compelling evidence supporting the protective role of PSO in preventing AD (OR = 0.891, 95% CI = 0.829-0.958, p = 0.002), as well as AR (OR = 0.998, 95% CI = 0.996-0.999, p = 0.008), these associations remained statistically significant even after Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, our findings did not reveal any substantial causal relationship between AA and either PSO or PSA. Conclusion Our study provides compelling evidence that PSO significantly confers protection against both AD and AR, while AD is likely to act as a protective factor for both PSO and PSA. Despite previous studies suggesting an association between allergic diseases and the incidence of PSO and PSA, our findings do not support this claim. To obtain more accurate and reliable conclusions regarding the causal mechanisms involved, larger sample sizes in randomized controlled trials or MR studies are warranted.",Archives of dermatological research..,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Arthritis, Psoriatic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Psoriasis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Rhinitis, Allergic; Asthma; Dermatitis, Atopic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease",False,8

Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to investigate the potential causal association between genetic susceptibility to IBD and nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases. Genetic variants were extracted as instrumental variables (IVs) from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis, which included 12,194 cases of Crohn's disease (CD) and 28,072 control cases of European ancestry. The GWAS for ulcerative colitis (UC) included 12,366 UC and 33,609 control cases of European ancestry. All IVs reached genome-wide significance (GWAS  Genetic susceptibility to UC was associated with an increased risk of AP (OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.03-1.13;  The evidence suggests that UC is associated with an elevated risk of AP and IBS, and IL-6 may be responsible in AP. CD is associated with an increased risk of developing CeD. Implementing a proactive monitoring program for assessing the risk of gastrointestinal diseases in UC patients, particularly those with elevated IL-6 levels, may be of interest.

FinnGen,38519926,Inflammatory cytokines mediating the effect of oral lichen planus on oral cavity cancer risk: a univariable and multivariable mendelian randomization study.,"While observational studies and experimental data suggest a link between oral lichen planus (OLP) and oral cavity cancer (OCC), the causal relationship and the role of inflammatory cytokines remain unclear. This study employed a univariable and multivariable Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationship between OLP and the risk of OCC. Additionally, the potential role of inflammatory cytokines in modulating this association was explored. Instrumental variables were derived from genetic variants associated with OLP (n = 377,277) identified in Finngen R9 datasets, with 41 inflammatory cytokines as potential mediators, and OCC (n = 4,151) as the outcome variable. Analytical methods including Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), Weighted Median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO were utilized to assess the causal links among OLP, inflammatory cytokines, and OCC risk. Multivariable MR (MVMR) was then applied to quantify the mediating effects of these cytokines in the relationship between OLP and increased OCC risk. MR analysis provided strong evidence of a causal relationship between OLP (OR = 1.417, 95% CI = 1.167-1.721, p < 0.001) and the risk of OCC. Furthermore, two inflammatory cytokines significantly influenced by OLP, IL-13 (OR = 1.088, 95% CI: 1.007-1.175, P = 0.032) and IL-9 (OR = 1.085, 95% CI: 1.005-1.171, P = 0.037), were identified. Subsequent analysis revealed a significant causal association only between IL-13 (OR = 1.408, 95% CI: 1.147-1.727, P = 0.001) and higher OCC risk, establishing it as a potential mediator. Further, MVMR analysis indicated that IL-13 (OR = 1.437, 95% CI = 1.139-1.815, P = 0.002) mediated the relationship between OLP and OCC, accounting for 8.13% of the mediation. This study not only elucidates the potential causal relationship between OLP and the risk of OCC but also highlights the pivotal mediating role of IL-13 in this association.",BMC oral health,2024,"Humans; Cytokines; Interleukin-13; Lichen Planus, Oral; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Mouth Neoplasms; Genome-Wide Association Study",False,8

However, the causality of these 2 diseases remains unclear. We conducted bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationship between periodontitis and IBD. We obtained the genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data of European populations from FinnGen database (for IBD) and a published article (for periodontitis), from which independent single nucleotide polymorphisms were selected as instrumental variables. Inverse variance-weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median (WM) methods were utilized for MR analysis. Heterogeneity or pleiotropy was detected through Cochran's Q test and MR-Egger intercept, respectively. Outlier was identified with MR-PRESSO (Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier) and leave-one-out analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with R 4.2.1 and the packages of TwoSampleMR version 0.5.6. Genetic prediction showed that periodontitis was the risk factor of UC (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.26; P = .027), rather than of CD (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74-1.15; P = .456) and IBD (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.81-1.13; P = .619). To the contrary, CD, not UC or IBD, resulted in exacerbating periodontitis in terms of the results of the IVW (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17; P = .021) and WM (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.20; P = .030) methods. Heterogeneity or pleiotropy was acceptable. Our results indicated that CD was the risk factor for periodontitis; conversely, periodontitis was responsible for the exacerbation of UC, enhancing the existence of mouth-gut axis. Patients with UC should pay more attention to periodontal health, while patients with periodontitis should actively pay close heed to intestinal health. A bidirectional Mendelian randomization study indicated that Crohn’s disease was the risk factor for periodontitis; conversely, periodontitis was responsible for the exacerbation of ulcerative colitis, enhancing the existence of the mouth-gut axis and suggesting paying attention to oral health for patients of inflammatory bowel disease.",Inflammatory bowel diseases,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Periodontitis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Crohn Disease; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Colitis, Ulcerative; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases",False,5
FinnGen,38336194,Association between daytime napping and incident arrhythmias: A prospective cohort study and mendelian randomization analysis.,"Emerging evidence has linked daytime napping with the risk of cardiovascular events. Cardiac arrhythmias are considered an early clinical stage for cardiovascular diseases. However, whether napping frequency is associated with incident arrhythmias remains unknown. This study aimed to prospectively investigate the association between napping frequency and cardiac arrhythmias. Daytime napping frequency was self-reported in response to touchscreen questionnaires. The primary outcomes were incident arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/Af), ventricular arrhythmia, and bradyarrhythmia. Cox regression analysis was conducted on the basis of 491,117 participants free of cardiac arrhythmias from the UK Biobank. The 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) and 1-sample MR were used to ensure a causal effect of genetically predicted daytime napping on the risk of arrhythmias. During a median follow-up of 11.91 years, 28,801 incident AF/Af cases, 4132 incident ventricular arrhythmias, and 11,616 incident bradyarrhythmias were documented. Compared with never/rarely napping, usually napping was significantly associated with higher risks of AF/Af (hazard ratio, 1.141; 95% CI, 1.083-1.203) and bradyarrhythmia (hazard ratio, 1.138; 95% CI, 1.049-1.235) but not ventricular arrhythmia after adjustment for various covariates. The 2-sample MR and 1-sample MR analysis showed that increased daytime napping frequency was likely to be a potential causal risk factor for AF/Af in FinnGen (odds ratio, 1.626; 95% CI, 1.061-2.943) and bradyarrhythmia in the UK Biobank (odds ratio, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.002-1.008). The results of this study add to the burgeoning evidence of an association between daytime napping frequency and an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias including AF/Af, ventricular arrhythmia, and bradyarrhythmia.",Heart rhythm,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Female; Male; Prospective Studies; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Incidence; Middle Aged; Sleep; United Kingdom; Risk Factors; Follow-Up Studies; Aged",False,0
FinnGen,38264647,Causal role of immune cells in generalized anxiety disorder: Mendelian randomization study.,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a prevalent emotional disorder that has received relatively little attention regarding its immunological basis. Recent years have seen the widespread use of high-density genetic markers such as SNPs or CNVs for genotyping, as well as the advancement of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) technologies, which have facilitated the understanding of immunological mechanisms underlying several major psychiatric disorders. Despite these advancements, the immunological basis of GAD remains poorly understood. In light of this, we aimed to explore the causal relationship between immune cells and the disease through a Mendelian randomization study. The summary information for GAD (Ncase=4,666, Ncontrol=337,577) was obtained from the FinnGen dataset. Summary statistics for the characterization of 731 immune cells, including morphological parameters (MP=32), median fluorescence intensity (MFI=389), absolute cells (AC=118), and relative cells (RC=192), were derived from the GWAS catalog. The study involved both forward MR analysis, with immune cell traits as the exposure and GAD as the outcome, and reverse MR analysis, with GAD as the exposure and immune cell traits as the outcome. We performed extensive sensitivity analyses to confirm the robustness, heterogeneity, and potential multi-biological effects of the study results. Also, to control for false positive results during multiple hypothesis testing, we adopted a false discovery rate (FDR) to control for statistical bias due to multiple comparisons. After FDR correction, GAD had no statistically significant effect on immunophenotypes. Several phenotypes with unadjusted low P-values are worth mentioning, including decreased PB/PC levels on B cells(β=-0.289, 95%CI=0.044~0.194,  The study has shown the close association between immune cells and GAD through genetic methods, thereby offering direction for future clinical research.",Frontiers in immunology,2023,Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Anxiety Disorders; Granulocytes; B-Lymphocytes,False,7
FinnGen,38408933,Body mass index stratified meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of polycystic ovary syndrome in women of European ancestry.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex multifactorial disorder with a substantial genetic component. However, the clinical manifestations of PCOS are heterogeneous with notable differences between lean and obese women, implying a different pathophysiology manifesting in differential body mass index (BMI). We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from six well-characterised cohorts, using a case-control study design stratified by BMI, aiming to identify genetic variants associated with lean and overweight/obese PCOS subtypes. The study comprised 254,588 women (5,937 cases and 248,651 controls) from individual studies performed in Australia, Estonia, Finland, the Netherlands and United States of America, and separated according to three BMI stratifications (lean, overweight and obese). Genome-wide association analyses were performed for each stratification within each cohort, with the data for each BMI group meta-analysed using METAL software. Almost half of the total study population (47%, n = 119,584) were of lean BMI (≤ 25 kg/m Genetic variation at the XBP1, LINC02905 and ERBB4 loci were associated with PCOS within unique BMI strata, while DENND1A demonstrated associations across multiple strata, providing evidence of both distinct and shared genetic features between lean and overweight/obese PCOS-affected women. This study demonstrated that PCOS-affected women with contrasting body weight are not only phenotypically distinct but also show variation in genetic architecture; lean PCOS women typically display elevated gonadotrophin ratios, lower insulin resistance, higher androgen levels, including adrenal androgens, and more favourable lipid profiles. Overall, these findings add to the growing body of evidence supporting a genetic basis for PCOS as well as differences in genetic patterns relevant to PCOS BMI-subtype.",BMC genomics,2024,Female; Humans; Body Mass Index; Genome-Wide Association Study; Overweight; Case-Control Studies; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Obesity,False,8

To provide evidence for the development of effective screening and prevention strategies, this study employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causality between neuroticism clusters and female reproductive diseases. Instrumental variables were obtained from large-scale genome-wide association studies of populations of European descent involving three neuroticism clusters (depressed affect, worry, sensitivity to environmental stress, and adversity [SESA]) in the Complex Trait Genetics database and six female reproductive diseases (infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS], spontaneous abortion, recurrent spontaneous abortion, endometriosis, and uterine fibroids) in the FinnGen database. The bidirectional two-sample MR analysis was conducted using the inverse variance-weighted, weighted median, and MR-Egger methods, whereas the sensitivity analysis was conducted using the Cochran's Q-test, MR-Egger intercept, and leave-one-out analysis. In the forward analysis, genetically predicted depressed affect and worry components of neuroticism significantly increased the risk of infertility (depressed affect: odds ratio [OR] = 1.399, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.054-1.856, p = 0.020; worry: OR = 1.587, 95% CI: 1.229-2.049, p = 0.000) and endometriosis (depressed affect: OR = 1.611, 95% CI: 1.234-2.102, p = 0.000; worry: OR = 1.812, 95% CI: 1.405-2.338, p = 0.000). Genetically predicted SESA component of neuroticism increased only the risk of endometriosis (OR = 1.524, 95% CI: 1.104-2.103, p = 0.010). In the reverse analysis, genetically predicted PCOS was causally associated with an increased risk of the worry component of neuroticism (Beta = 0.009, 95% CI: 0.003-0.016, p = 0.003). The MR study showed that the three neuroticism personality clusters had definite causal effects on at least one specific female reproductive disease. Moreover, PCOS may increase the risk of the worry component of neuroticism. This finding suggests the need to screen for specific female reproductive diseases in populations with high neuroticism and assess the psychological status of patients with PCOS.",BMC women's health,2024,"Female; Humans; Abortion, Habitual; Abortion, Spontaneous; Depression; Endometriosis; Europe; Genital Diseases, Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Infertility, Female; Leiomyoma; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Neuroticism; Personality; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; White People",False,8

Nevertheless, it is still challenging to determine the causality, due to a number of shortcomings in observational research and randomized controlled trials. Mendelian randomization (MR) with two samples was conducted to investigate the potential causative association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and GDM risk. Publicly accessible summary data from independent cohorts were used for two-sample MR. For 25(OH)D, we obtained data from UK Biobank, IEU and EBI, then performed a meta-analysis to enhance the statistical power (via METAL); for VDBP, data were obtained from the INTERVAL study; for GDM, data were obtained from FinnGen. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach was performed as the main analysis, together with several sensitivity analyses, such as MR-Egger, maximum likelihood, weighted median, and weighted mode.

Then, due to issues such as bias, reverse causality, and residual confounding, inferring causal relationships from these studies may be challenging. Therefore, this study aims to explore the effects of circulating lipids and lipid-lowering drugs on MIF through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and evaluate the mediating role of vitamin D. Genetic variations related to lipid traits and the lipid-lowering effect of lipid modification targets are extracted from the Global Alliance for Lipid Genetics Genome-Wide Association Study. The summary statistics for MIF are from the FinnGen 9th edition. Using quantitative expression feature loci data from relevant organizations to obtain genetic variations related to gene expression level, further to explore the relationship between these target gene expression levels and MIF risk. Two-step MR analysis is used to explore the mediating role of vitamin D. Multiple sensitivity analysis methods (co-localization analysis, Egger intercept test, Cochrane's Q test, pleiotropy residuals and outliers (MR-PRESSO), and the leave-one-out method) are used to demonstrate the reliability of our results. In our study, we observed that lipid modification of four lipid-lowering drug targets was associated with MIF risk, the LDLR activator (equivalent to a 1-SD decrease in LDL-C) (OR=1.94, 95% CI 1.14-3.28, FDR=0.040), LPL activator (equivalent to a 1-SD decrease in TG) (OR=1.86, 95% CI 1.25-2.76, FDR=0.022), and CETP inhibitor (equivalent to a 1-SD increase in HDL-C) (OR=1.28, 95% CI 1.07-1.53, FDR=0.035) were associated with a higher risk of MIF. The HMGCR inhibitor (equivalent to a 1-SD decrease in LDL-C) was associated with a lower risk of MIF (OR=0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.83, FDR=0.39). Lipid-modifying effects of three targets were partially mediated by serum vitamin D levels. Mediation was 0.035 (LDLR activator), 0.012 (LPL activator), and 0.030 (CETP inhibitor), with mediation ratios of 5.34% (LDLR activator), 1.94% (LPL activator), and 12.2% (CETP inhibitor), respectively. In addition, there was no evidence that lipid properties and lipid modification effects of six other lipid-lowering drug targets were associated with MIF risk. Multiple sensitivity analysis methods revealed insignificant evidence of bias arising from pleiotropy or genetic confounding.

Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to further evaluate the causal association between fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), T1DM, T2DM and vitiligo. We used aggregated genome-wide association data from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) online database of European adults vitiligo; HbA1c data were from IEU. Fasting blood glucose data were obtained from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). T1DM and T2DM data were from FinnGen. We used bidirectional two-sample and multivariate MR analyses to test whether dysglycemic measures (fasting blood glucose, HbA1c), diabetes-related measures (T1DM, T2DM) are causatively associated with vitiligo. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) method was used as the main test method, MR-Egger, Weighted mode and Weighted median were used as supplementary methods. We found no statistically significant evidence to support a causal association between dysglycemic traits and vitiligo, but in the correlation analysis of diabetic traits, our data supported a positive causal association between T1DM and vitiligo (p = 0.018). In the follow-up multivariate MR analysis, our results still supported this conclusion (p = 0.016), and suggested that HbA1c was not a mediator of T1DM affecting the pathogenesis of vitiligo. No reverse causality was found in any of the reverse MR Analyses of dysglycemic traits and diabetic traits. Our findings support that T1DM is a risk factor for the development of vitiligo, and this conclusion may explain why the co-presentation of T1DM and vitiligo is often seen in observational studies.

FinnGen,38762700,Potential drug targets for tumors identified through Mendelian randomization analysis.,"According to the latest cancer research data, there are a significant number of new cancer cases and a substantial mortality rate each year. Although a substantial number of clinical patients are treated with existing cancer drugs each year, the efficacy is unsatisfactory. The incidence is still high and the effectiveness of most cancer drugs remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, we evaluated the human proteins for their causal relationship to for cancer risk and therefore also their potential as drug targets. We used summary tumors data from the FinnGen and cis protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTL) data from a genome-wide association study, and employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the association between potential drug targets and nine tumors, including breast, colorectal, lung, liver, bladder, prostate, kidney, head and neck, pancreatic caners. Furthermore, we conducted MR analysis on external cohort. Moreover, Bidirectional MR, Steiger filtering, and colocalization were employed to validate the main results. The DrugBank database was used to discover potential drugs of tumors. Under the threshold of False discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, results showed that S100A16 was protective protein and S100A14 was risk protein for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER-positive) breast cancer, phosphodiesterase 5A (PDE5A) was risk protein for colorectal cancer, and melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) was protective protein for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). And there was no reverse causal association between them. Colocalization analysis showed that S100A14 (PP.H4.abf = 0.920) and S100A16 (PP.H4.abf = 0.932) shared causal variation with HER-positive breast cancer, and PDE5A (PP.H4.abf = 0.857) shared causal variation with colorectal cancer (CRC). The MR results of all pQTL of PDE5A and MIA were consistent with main results. In addition, the MR results of MIA and external outcome cohort were consistent with main results. In this study, genetic predictions indicate that circulating S100 calcium binding protein A14 (S100A14) and S100 calcium binding protein A16 (S100A16) are associated with increase and decrease in the risk of HER-positive breast cancer, respectively. Circulating PDE5A is associated with increased risk of CRC, while circulating MIA is associated with decreased risk of NSCLC.

However, although there were a few studies trying to link sex hormones with COPD, their effect remained limited due to small sample size and insufficient causal results. This study aims to investigate the association between sex hormones and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database and evaluate causality via a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). Data from NHANES 2013-2016 were enrolled for the cross-sectional study. The association between sex hormones and COPD was evaluated via multivariable logistic regression. Sex-stratified analysis, subgroup analyses and interaction tests were performed to further evaluate the correlation. For MR analysis, data were collected from genome-wide association studies and FinnGen datasets. The inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) approach, along with four other approaches, was applied in the analysis. Further sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the existence of pleiotropy and heterogeneity. 7,617 eligible participants were enrolled in the cross-sectional analysis. Negative associations were observed in both testosterone-COPD (OR 0.770, 95% CI 0.626, 0.948, p = 0.018) and estradiol-COPD (OR 0.794, 95% CI 0.688, 0.915, p = 0.005) relationships after covariate adjustments. However, the results from IVW-MR analysis showed that no causal relationship was observed in either the testosterone-COPD (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53, 1.29, p = 0.407) or estradiol-COPD (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.23, 2.38, p = 0.616) relationship, which was also supported by the other four approaches (all p values > 0.05).

We aimed to use MRI-derived measures of liver fat and genetics to investigate causal mechanisms that link higher liver fat to various health outcomes. We conducted a genome-wide association study on 37,358 UK Biobank participants to identify genetic variants associated with liver fat measured from MRI scans. We used a Mendelian randomisation approach to investigate the causal effect of liver fat on health outcomes independent of BMI, alcohol consumption and lipids using data from published genome-wide association studies and FinnGen. We identified 13 genetic variants associated with liver fat that had differing effects on the risks of health outcomes. Genetic variants associated with impaired hepatic triglyceride export showed liver fat-increasing alleles to be correlated with a reduced risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction but an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes, while variants associated with enhanced de novo lipogenesis showed liver fat-increasing alleles to be linked to a higher risk of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. Genetically higher liver fat content increased the risk of non-alcohol-related cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and intrahepatic bile duct and gallbladder cancers, exhibiting a dose-dependent relationship, irrespective of the mechanism. This study provides fresh insight into the heterogeneous effect of liver fat on health outcomes. It challenges the notion that liver fat per se is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, underscoring the dependency of this association on the specific mechanisms that drive fat accumulation in the liver. However, excess liver fat, regardless of the underlying mechanism, appears to be causally linked to cirrhosis and cancers in a dose-dependent manner. This research advances our understanding of the heterogeneity in mechanisms influencing liver fat accumulation, providing new insights into how liver fat accumulation may impact various health outcomes. The findings challenge the notion that liver fat is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and highlight the mechanistic effect of some genetic variants on fat accumulation and the development of cardiovascular diseases. This study is of particular importance for healthcare professionals including physicians and researchers, as well as patients, as it allows for more targeted and personalised treatment by understanding the relationship between liver fat and various health outcomes. The findings emphasise the need for a personalised management approach and a reshaping of risk assessment criteria. It also provides room for prioritising a clinical intervention aimed at reducing liver fat content (likely via intentional weight loss) that could help protect against liver-related fibrosis and cancer.",Journal of hepatology,2024,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Middle Aged; Fatty Liver; Genetic Variation; Liver; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Liver Neoplasms; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; United Kingdom; Risk Factors",False,0
FinnGen,38862880,Investigating causal associations between pneumonia and lung cancer using a bidirectional mendelian randomization framework.,"Pneumonia and lung cancer are both major respiratory diseases, and observational studies have explored the association between their susceptibility. However, due to the presence of potential confounders and reverse causality, the comprehensive causal relationships between pneumonia and lung cancer require further exploration. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary-level data were obtained from the hitherto latest FinnGen database, COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative resource, and International Lung Cancer Consortium. We implemented a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to evaluate the causal relationships between several specific types of pneumonia and lung cancer. The causal estimates were mainly calculated by inverse-variance weighted (IVW) approach. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were also conducted to validate the robustness of the causalty. In the MR analyses, overall pneumonia demonstrated a suggestive but modest association with overall lung cancer risk (Odds ratio [OR]: 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01 - 1.44, P = 0.037). The correlations between specific pneumonia types and overall lung cancer were not as significant, including bacterial pneumonia (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.91 - 1.26, P = 0.386), viral pneumonia (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.95 - 1.06, P = 0.891), asthma-related pneumonia (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.92 - 1.52, P = 0.181), and COVID-19 (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.78 - 1.30, P = 0.952). Reversely, with lung cancer as the exposure, we observed that overall lung cancer had statistically crucial associations with bacterial pneumonia (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.03 - 1.13, P = 0.001) and viral pneumonia (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01 - 1.19, P = 0.037). Sensitivity analysis also confirmed the robustness of these findings. This study has presented a systematic investigation into the causal relationships between pneumonia and lung cancer subtypes.

FinnGen,39643614,Novel loci and biomedical consequences of iron homoeostasis variation.,"Iron homoeostasis is tightly regulated, with hepcidin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) playing significant roles. However, the genetic determinants of these traits and the biomedical consequences of iron homoeostasis variation are unclear. In a meta-analysis of 12 cohorts involving 91,675 participants, we found 43 genomic loci associated with either hepcidin or sTfR concentration, of which 15 previously unreported. Mapping to putative genes indicated involvement in iron-trait expression, erythropoiesis, immune response and cellular trafficking. Mendelian randomisation of 292 disease outcomes in 1,492,717 participants revealed associations of iron-related loci and iron status with selected health outcomes across multiple domains. These associations were largely driven by HFE, which was associated with the largest iron variation. Our findings enhance understanding of iron homoeostasis and its biomedical consequences, suggesting that lifelong exposure to higher iron levels is likely associated with lower risk of anaemia-related disorders and higher risk of genitourinary, musculoskeletal, infectious and neoplastic diseases.",Communications biology,2024,"Humans; Iron; Homeostasis; Hepcidins; Receptors, Transferrin; Hemochromatosis Protein; Female; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Male; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,8
FinnGen,39142284,Genetic and functional analysis of Raynaud's syndrome implicates loci in vasculature and immunity.,"Raynaud's syndrome is a dysautonomia where exposure to cold causes vasoconstriction and hypoxia, particularly in the extremities. We performed meta-analysis in four cohorts and discovered eight loci (ADRA2A, IRX1, NOS3, ACVR2A, TMEM51, PCDH10-DT, HLA, and RAB6C) where ADRA2A, ACVR2A, NOS3, TMEM51, and IRX1 co-localized with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), particularly in distal arteries. CRISPR gene editing further showed that ADRA2A and NOS3 loci modified gene expression and in situ RNAscope clarified the specificity of ADRA2A in small vessels and IRX1 around small capillaries in the skin. A functional contraction assay in the cold showed lower contraction in ADRA2A-deficient and higher contraction in ADRA2A-overexpressing smooth muscle cells. Overall, our study highlights the power of genome-wide association testing with functional follow-up as a method to understand complex diseases. The results indicate temperature-dependent adrenergic signaling through ADRA2A, effects at the microvasculature by IRX1, endothelial signaling by NOS3, and immune mechanisms by the HLA locus in Raynaud's syndrome.",Cell genomics,2024,Raynaud Disease; Humans; Quantitative Trait Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Female; Male,False,0

Thus, this study aimed to examine whether a causal link exists between genetically determined NAFLD and GDM. Utilizing publicly accessible genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted. The GWASs data pertaining to NAFLD and GDM were obtained from the UK Biobank Consortium and FinnGen database in primary analysis, respectively. The random-effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was utilized as primary analysis method. Several sensitivity analyses were utilized to verify the robustness of the results. Additionally, we also analyzed the causal effect of potential shared influencing factors on these two conditions. The result of the IVW method showed that there was no significant causal relationship between genetically determined NAFLD and GDM (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.90-1.07, P = 0.691). Similarly, our reverse MR analysis failed to detect a significant causal effect of GDM on NAFLD (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.97-1.36, P = 0.118). Sensitivity analyses further confirmed the robustness of the results. Moreover, we found that genetically determined body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, triglycerides, and television viewing time may be positively correlated with NAFLD and GDM, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I may both be negatively correlated with NAFLD and GDM. The current bidirectional MR study failed to provide sufficient genetic evidence for the causal relationship between NAFLD and GDM.",BMC endocrine disorders,2024,"Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Diabetes, Gestational; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Body Mass Index",False,3
FinnGen,39580426,HIV and risk of hypertension: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Previous studies have shown that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with hypertension; however, the results of these studies are affected by a variety of confounding factors. There is no definite evidence to prove a causal relationship between these two factors. This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between HIV infection and hypertension. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted using genome-wide association study (GWAS) statistics published online. The data were collected mainly from the OpenGWAS and FinnGen databases. The HIV database contained 357 HIV patients and 218,435 control patients; the hypertension database contained 54,358 patients and 408,652 control patients; and the blood pressure database contained 436,424 samples. Random effect inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the main analysis method, weighted median and Mr-Egger analysis methods were used to ensure the accuracy of the results, and Cochran's Q test and Mr-Egger regression methods were used to detect heterogeneity and correct multiple horizontal effects. Finally, the leave-one-out method was used to analyse the reliability of the test results. In order to further verify the research results, different databases were used and the same statistical method was used for a replication analysis. In order to prevent false positive results caused by multiple tests, Bonferroni correction is used to correct the statistical results. After screening, a total of 9 SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) were selected as the instrumental variable (IV) used in this study. The IVW MR analysis results showed a causal relationship between HIV infection and the risk of hypertension (IVW: OR = 1.001, P = 0.03). When systolic blood pressure was the outcome, the IVW method results were positive (OR = 1.004, P = 0.01280), and when diastolic blood pressure was the outcome, the weighted median method results were positive (OR = 1.004, P = 0.04570). According to the sensitivity analysis, the results of this study were unlikely to be affected by heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. The leave-one-out analysis showed that the results of this study did not change significantly with the elimination of a single SNP. In replication analysis, when diastolic blood pressure was taken as the outcome, the weighted median method was positive (OR = 1.042, P = 0.037). Sensitivity analysis shows that there is heterogeneity, but there is no horizontal pleiotropy. The leave-one-out analysis showed that the results of this study did not change significantly with the elimination of a single SNP. As the first exploratory study using MR method to study the causal relationship between HIV infection and hypertension and blood pressure, this study found that HIV infection may increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure and increase the risk of hypertension. PLWH, as a high-risk group of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, should prevent the occurrence of hypertension in order to further improve their quality of life. However, this study also has some limitations. The results of the relationship between HIV infection and hypertension and blood pressure may be affected by the lack of statistical efficacy. In order to further confirm this conclusion, more large-scale RCT or genetic studies should be carried out.",BMC infectious diseases,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; HIV Infections; Hypertension; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors",False,2
FinnGen,39316602,Causal associations of air pollution with rheumatoid arthritis: A transethnic Mendelian randomization study.,"Rheumatoid arthritis is a common rheumatic disease, and its onset is closely related to genetic and environmental factors, however, the relationship between air pollution and RA is still hotly debated. Further investigation of the relationship between air pollution and rheumatoid arthritis is conducive to a comprehensive understanding of the risk factors of the disease, providing certain value for the clinical prevention and treatment of RA. We used a Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization approach, integrating the large-scale public genomewide association study, to assess the genetically predicted causal effect of air pollution (including: PM2.5, PM2.5-10, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides) on RA in European and European East Asian populations, respectively. Indicators related to air pollution (2,505 individuals to 423,796 individuals), including European and East Asian populations were obtained from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit open GWAS project. Published East Asian RA data were also obtained from the IEU open GWAS project (212,453 individuals), while large-scale publicly available European RA data were obtained from finngen R10 (13,621 cases and 262,844 controls). Inverse variance weighting was used as the primary analytical method, complemented by MR-egger, Weighed median, and Weighted mode results. Cochran Q tested for heterogeneity, and MR-Egger regression analyses were performed to test for multiplicity. leave-one-out analysis allowed for the robustness and reliability were assessed. No statistically significant effects of PM2.5, PM2.5-10, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides and RA were observed in either European or East Asian populations. Results from European data: PM2.5 (IVW OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.27-1.91; p = 0.498; number of SNPs: 5), PM2.5-10 (IVW OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.61-2.40; p = 0.596; number of SNPs: 15), PM10 (IVW OR: 1.69; 95% CI: 0.84-3.39; p = 0.142; number of SNPs: 9), nitrogen dioxide (IVW OR: 3.88; 95% CI: 0.19-77.77; p = 0.375; number of SNPs: 2), nitrogen oxides (IVW OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.16-1.67; p = 0.268; number of SNPs: 4).

FinnGen,38545784,Evaluation of Plasma Biomarkers for Causal Association With Peripheral Artery Disease.,"Hundreds of biomarkers for peripheral artery disease (PAD) have been reported in the literature; however, the observational nature of these studies limits causal inference due to the potential of reverse causality and residual confounding. We sought to evaluate the potential causal impact of putative PAD biomarkers identified in human observational studies through genetic causal inference methods. Putative circulating PAD biomarkers were identified from human observational studies through a comprehensive literature search based on terms related to PAD using PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase. Genetic instruments were generated from publicly available genome-wide association studies of circulating biomarkers. Two-sample Mendelian randomization was used to test the association of genetically determined biomarker levels with PAD using summary statistics from a genome-wide association study of 31 307 individuals with and 211 753 individuals without PAD in the Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program and replicated in data from FinnGen comprised of 11 924 individuals with and 288 638 individuals without PAD. We identified 204 unique circulating biomarkers for PAD from the observational literature, of which 173 were genetically instrumented using genome-wide association study results. After accounting for multiple testing (false discovery rate, <0.05), 10 of 173 (5.8%) biomarkers had significant associations with PAD. These 10 biomarkers represented categories including plasma lipoprotein regulation, lipid homeostasis, and protein-lipid complex remodeling. Observational literature highlighted different pathways including inflammatory response, negative regulation of multicellular organismal processes, and regulation of response to external stimuli. Integrating human observational studies and genetic causal inference highlights several key pathways in PAD pathophysiology. This work demonstrates that a substantial portion of biomarkers identified in observational studies are not well supported by human genetic evidence and emphasizes the importance of triangulating evidence to understand PAD pathophysiology. Although the identified biomarkers offer insights into atherosclerotic development in the lower limb, their specificity to PAD compared with more widespread atherosclerosis requires further study.","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2024,"Humans; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Biomarkers; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Observational Studies as Topic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Risk Factors; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Predictive Value of Tests",False,2

Using high-quality nationwide health registry data and genome-wide genotyping, we evaluate the impact of socio-demographic and genetic risk factors on adherence and persistence for 5 common medication classes that require long-term, regular therapy (N = 1,814,591 individuals from Finnish nationwide registries, 217,005 with genetic data from Finland and Estonia). Need for social assistance and immigration status show a notable negative effect on persistence and adherence across the examined medications (odd ratios between 0.48 and 0.82 for persistence and between 1.1% to 4.3% decrease in adherence) while demographic and health factors show comparably modest or inconsistent effects. A genome-wide scan does not identify genetic variants associated with the two phenotypes, while some pharmacogenes (i.e. CYP2C9 and SLCO1B1) are modestly associated with persistence, but not with adherence. We observe significant genetic correlations between medication adherence and participation in research studies.

FinnGen,39126459,The risk stratification and predictive performance of a new combined polygenic risk score for hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in liver diseases have generated some polygenic risk scores (PRSs), but their predictive effectiveness on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk assessment remains unclear. Here, we constructed a novel combined polygenic risk score and evaluated its increment to the well-established risk model. We used 15 HCC-associated genetic loci from two PRSs and FinnGen GWAS data to calculate a PRS-combined score and to fit the related PRS model in the UK Biobank cohort (N = 436,162). The PRS-combined score was further assessed for risk stratification for HCC integrating with the recommended clinical risk scores. The PRS-combined model achieved a better AUC (0.657) than that of PRS-HFC (0.637) and PRS-cirrhosis (0.645). The top 20% of the PRS-combined distribution had a 3.25 increased risk of HCC vs. the middle decile (45-55%). At the population level, the addition of PRS-combined to the CLivD score significantly increased the C-statistic (from 0.716 to 0.746) and provided a remarkable improvement in reclassification (NRI = 0.088) at the 10-year risk threshold of 0.2%. In clinic, additional assessment of PRS-combined would reclassify 34,647 intermediate-risk participants as high genetic risk, corresponding to an increase of 63.92% (62/97) of the HCC events classified at high risk using the Fibrosis-4 alone.

FinnGen,39395132,Exploring the relationship between sarcopenia and 11 respiratory diseases: a comprehensive mendelian randomization analysis.,"Sarcopenia (SP) is an aging-related loss of muscle mass and function, affecting the respiratory system. However, the causality of the association between sarcopenia on lung diseases remains elusive. The bidirectional univariate Mendelian randomization (UVMR), multivariate MR (MVMR) analysis, and mediation MR were utilized to systematically investigate the genetic causal relationship of SP and 11 respiratory diseases. Independent genomic variants related to sarcopenia or respiratory diseases were identified as instrumental variables (IVs), and the summary level data of genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) were obtained from the UK biobank and FinnGen. MVMR analysis was conducted to explore the mediation effects of body mass index (BMI), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), smoking, education attainment (EA), physical activity, and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Forward UVMR analysis based on the primary method revealed that pneumoconiosis was associated with a higher risk of appendicular lean mass (ALM) (OR = 1.01, p = 0.03), and BMI (10.65%), smoking (10.65%), and physical activity (17.70%) had a mediating role in the effect of pneumoconiosis on ALM. In reverse MR analysis, we found that genetically predicted ALM was significantly associated with an increased risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) (OR = 1.24, p = 7.21E-05). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR = 0.98, p = 0.002) and sarcoidosis (OR = 1.01, p = 0.004) were identified to increase the loss of left-hand grip strength (HGS). Conversely, the increase in left- HGS presented a protective effect on chronic bronchitis (CB) (OR = 0.35, p = 0.03), (OR = 0.80, p = 0.02), and asthma (OR = 0.78, p = 0.04). Similarly, the loss of the right-HGS elevated the risk of low respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (OR = 0.97, p = 0.02) and bronchiectasis (OR = 1.01, p = 0.03), which is also an independent protective factor for LRTI and asthma. In the aspects of low HGS, the risk of LRTI was increased after MVMR analysis, and the risk of sarcoidosis and pneumoconiosis was elevated in the reverse analysis. Lastly, asthma was found to be related to the loss of the usual walking pace, and the reverse MR analysis suggested a causal relationship between the usual walking pace and LRTI (OR = 0.32, p = 2.79 × 10- This data-driven MR analysis revealed SP was bidirectional causally associated with lung diseases, providing genetic evidence for further mechanistic and clinical studies to understand the crosstalk between SP and lung diseases.",Aging clinical and experimental research,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Sarcopenia; Genome-Wide Association Study; Body Mass Index; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Male; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Female; Smoking; Pneumoconiosis",False,9

One of the most common inflammatory skin diseases, its occurrence and development are related to inflammation. Nevertheless, the precise nature of the relationship between circulating inflammatory proteins and AD remains uncertain. A two-sample MR analysis was performed to determine the causal relationship between the expression of 91 circulating inflammatory proteins and AD by using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics data from the FinnGen consortia. The robustness of the MR results was assessed by means of sensitivity analysis. The causal relationship between the expression of nine specific circulating inflammatory proteins and AD was corroborated by the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method. The findings indicated that three circulating inflammatory proteins, namely, interleukin-18 receptor 1 [OR (CI) = 1.08 (1.05-1.11); p = 0.000001)], interleukin-8 [OR (CI) = 1.07 (1.00-1.14); p = 0.036244)], and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14 [OR (CI) = 1.05 (1.00-1.10); p = 0.036842)], were positively correlated with AD.

In the UKB cohort study, compared to participants with normal hearing, those in the mild and severe hearing impairment groups had progressively and significantly higher risk of all-cause dementia (mild: HR1.52, 95%CI 1.31-1.77; severe: HR1.80, 95%CI 1.36-2.38), AD (mild: HR1.63, 95%CI 1.30-2.04; severe: HR2.18, 95%CI 1.45-3.27), VD (mild: HR1.68, 95%CI 1.19-2.37; severe: HR1.47, 95%CI 1.22-1.78), and NAVD (mild: HR1.47, 95%CI 1.22-1.78; severe: HR1.98, 95%CI 1.43-2.75). Besides, vision impairment was associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR1.55, 95%CI 1.18-2.04) and NAVD (HR1.51, 95%CI 1.07-2.13). Furthermore, dual sensory impairment was associated with stepwise increased risks of all-cause and cause-specific dementia than single hearing or vision impairment. In the meta-analysis of 31 prospective cohort studies, risks of all-cause dementia and AD were elevated in participants with single hearing impairment (all-cause dementia: HR1.30, 95%CI 1.21-1.40; AD: HR1.30, 95%CI 1.21-1.40) and dual sensory impairment (all-cause dementia: HR1.63, 95%CI1.14-2.12; AD: HR 2.55, 95%CI 1.19-3.91), while single vision impairment only associated with higher risk of all-cause dementia (HR1.43, 95%CI 1.16-1.71) but not AD. Finally, the MR analysis revealed a significant association between hearing impairment and all-cause dementia (OR1.74, 95%CI 1.01-2.99), AD (OR1.56, 95%CI 1.09-2.23), and NAVD (OR1.14, 1.02-1.26), as well as vision impairment and NAVD (OR1.62, 95%CI 1.13-2.33). Our findings showed significant associations between hearing and vision impairments and increased risks of all-cause and cause-specific dementia.

To investigate the potential for genetic predisposition to VTE in OC or HT users, we conducted a gene-by-environment case-only meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Use or nonuse of OCs (7 studies) or HT (8 studies) at the time of the VTE event was determined by pharmacy records or self-report. A synergy index (SI) was modeled for each variant in each study and submultiplicative/supramultiplicative gene-by-environment interactions were estimated. The SI parameters were first meta-analyzed across OC and HT studies and subsequently meta-analyzed to obtain an overall estimate. The primary analysis was agnostic GWAS and interrogated all imputed genotypes using a P value threshold of <5.0 × 10 The VTE case-only OC meta-analysis included 2895 OC users and 6607 nonusers; the case-only HT meta-analysis included 2434 HT users and 12 793 nonusers.

FinnGen,37768647,Human Leukocyte Antigen Signatures as Pathophysiological Discriminants of Microscopic Colitis Subtypes.,"Microscopic colitis [MC] is currently regarded as an inflammatory bowel disease that manifests as two subtypes: collagenous colitis [CC] and lymphocytic colitis [LC]. Whether these represent a clinical continuum or distinct entities is, however, an open question. Genetic investigations may contribute important insight into their respective pathophysiologies. We conducted a genome-wide association study [GWAS] meta-analysis in 1498 CC, 373 LC patients, and 13 487 controls from Europe and the USA, combined with publicly available MC GWAS data from UK Biobank and FinnGen [2599 MC cases and 552 343 controls in total]. Human leukocyte antigen [HLA] alleles and polymorphic residues were imputed and tested for association, including conditional analyses for the identification of key causative variants and residues. Genetic correlations with other traits and diagnoses were also studied. We detected strong HLA association with CC, and conditional analyses highlighted the DRB1*03:01 allele and its residues Y26, N77, and R74 as key to this association (best p = 1.4 × 10-23, odds ratio [OR] = 1.96). Nominally significant genetic correlations were detected between CC and pneumonia [rg = 0.77; p = 0.048] and oesophageal diseases [rg = 0.45, p = 0.023]. An additional locus was identified in MC GWAS analyses near the CLEC16A and RMI2 genes on chromosome 16 [rs35099084, p = 2.0 × 10-8, OR = 1.31]. No significant association was detected for LC.

FinnGen,39009924,Multi-biobank Mendelian randomization analyses identify opposing pathways in plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol lowering and gallstone disease.,"Plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol is positively associated with coronary artery disease risk while biliary cholesterol promotes gallstone formation. Different plasma LDL-cholesterol lowering pathways may have distinct effects on biliary cholesterol and thereby gallstone disease risk. We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study using data from the UK Biobank (30,547 gallstone disease cases/336,742 controls), FinnGen (34,461 cases/301,383 controls) and Biobank Japan (9,305 cases/168,253 controls). We first performed drug-target MR analyses substantiated by colocalization to investigate the effects of plasma LDL-cholesterol lowering therapies on gallstone disease risk. We then performed clustered MR analyses and pathway analyses to identify distinct mechanisms underlying the association of plasma LDL-cholesterol with gallstone disease risk. For a 1-standard deviation reduction in plasma LDL-cholesterol, genetic mimics of statins were associated with lower gallstone disease risk (odds ratio 0.72 [95% confidence interval 0.62, 0.83]), but genetic mimics of PCSK9 inhibitors and targeting apolipoprotein B were associated with higher risk (1.11 [1.03, 1.19] and 1.23 [1.13, 1.35]). The association for statins was supported by colocalization (posterior probability 98.7%). Clustered MR analyses identified variant clusters showing opposing associations of plasma LDL-cholesterol with gallstone disease risk, with some evidence for ancestry-and sex-specific associations. Among variants lowering plasma LDL-cholesterol, those associated with lower gallstone disease risk were mapped to glycosphingolipid biosynthesis pathway, while those associated with higher risk were mapped to pathways relating to plasma lipoprotein assembly, remodelling, and clearance and ATP-binding cassette transporters. This MR study provides genetic evidence that different plasma LDL-cholesterol lowering pathways have opposing effects on gallstone disease risk.",European journal of epidemiology,2024,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Cholesterol, LDL; Gallstones; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Biological Specimen Banks; Japan; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; United Kingdom; Aged; Anticholesteremic Agents",False,0
FinnGen,38797326,Genome-wide association study of hospitalized patients and acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and devastating complication of hospitalization. Here, we identified genetic loci associated with AKI in patients hospitalized between 2002-2019 in the Million Veteran Program and data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center's BioVU. AKI was defined as meeting a modified KDIGO Stage 1 or more for two or more consecutive days or kidney replacement therapy. Control individuals were required to have one or more qualifying hospitalizations without AKI and no evidence of AKI during any other observed hospitalizations. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), stratified by race, adjusting for sex, age, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the top ten principal components of ancestry were conducted. Results were meta-analyzed using fixed effects models. In total, there were 54,488 patients with AKI and 138,051 non-AKI individuals included in the study. Two novel loci reached genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis: rs11642015 near the FTO locus on chromosome 16 (obesity traits) (odds ratio 1.07 (95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.09)) and rs4859682 near the SHROOM3 locus on chromosome 4 (glomerular filtration barrier integrity) (odds ratio 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.93-0.96)). These loci colocalized with previous studies of kidney function, and genetic correlation indicated significant shared genetic architecture between AKI and eGFR. Notably, the association at the FTO locus was attenuated after adjustment for BMI and diabetes, suggesting that this association may be partially driven by obesity. Both FTO and the SHROOM3 loci showed nominal evidence of replication from diagnostic-code-based summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and Biobank Japan. Thus, our large GWA meta-analysis found two loci significantly associated with AKI suggesting genetics may explain some risk for AKI.",Kidney international,2024,"Humans; Acute Kidney Injury; Genome-Wide Association Study; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Hospitalization; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase FTO; Risk Factors; Genetic Loci; Case-Control Studies",False,9
FinnGen,38466796,Inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 and liver-related complications in individuals with diabetes: a Mendelian randomization and population-based cohort study.,"No medication has been found to reduce liver-related events. We evaluated the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) on liver-related outcomes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with SGLT2 inhibition were identified, and a genetic risk score (GRS) was computed using the UK Biobank data (n=337,138). Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted using the FinnGen (n=218,792) database and the UK Biobank data. In parallel, a nationwide population-based study using the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database was conducted. The development of liver-related complications (ie, hepatic decompensation, HCC, liver transplantation, and death) was compared between individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and steatotic liver diseases treated with SGLT2i (n=13,208) and propensity score-matched individuals treated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (n=70,342). After computing GRS with 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs4488457, rs80577326, rs11865835, rs9930811, rs34497199, and rs35445454), GRS-based MR showed that SGLT2 inhibition (per 1 SD increase of GRS, 0.1% lowering of HbA1c) was negatively associated with cirrhosis development (adjusted odds ratio=0.83, 95% CI=0.70-0.98, p =0.03) and this was consistent in the 2-sample MR (OR=0.73, 95% CI=0.60-0.90, p =0.003). In the Korean NHIS database, the risk of liver-related complications was significantly lower in the SGLT2i group than in the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor group (adjusted hazard ratio=0.88, 95% CI=0.79-0.97, p =0.01), and this difference remained significant (adjusted hazard ratio=0.72-0.89, all p <0.05) across various sensitivity analyses.

FinnGen,39358768,"Association between lipid-lowering agents with intervertebral disc degeneration, sciatica and low back pain: a drug-targeted mendelian randomized study and cross-sectional observation.","Abnormal lipid metabolism is linked to intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), sciatica, and low back pain (LBP), but it remains unclear whether targeted interventions can prevent these issues. This study investigated the causal effects of lipid-lowering drug use on IVDD, sciatica, and LBP development. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to total cholesterol (TC), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and non-high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were obtained from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium's genome-wide association study (GWAS). Genes near HMGCR, PCSK9, and NPC1L1 were selected to represent therapeutic inhibition targets. Using Mendelian randomization (MR) focusing on these drug targets, we identified causal effects of PCSK9, HMGCR, and NPC1L1 on the risk of developing IVDD, sciatica, and LBP, with coronary heart disease risk serving as a positive control. Using summary data from Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis, we evaluated potential therapeutic targets for IVDD, sciatica, and LBP through protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL). The genetic associations with IVDD, sciatica, LBP, and coronary heart disease were derived from FinnGen (discovery) and UK Biobank (replication). Additionally, a cross-sectional observational study was performed using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to further investigate the connection between LBP and statin use, with a sample size of 4343 participants. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the outcomes. The NHANES-based cross-sectional study indicated that non-statin use was associated with an increased risk of developing LBP (OR = 1.29, 95% CI [1.04, 1.59], P = 0.019). Moreover, Inverse-variance weighting (IVW) analysis revealed that NPC1L1-mediated reductions in TC, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C concentrations were associated with a decreased risk of developing IVDD (P = 9.956E-03; P = 3.516E-02; P = 1.253E-04). Similarly, PCSK9-mediated reductions in LDL-C and TC concentrations were linked to a lower risk of developing sciatica (P = 3.825E-02; P = 2.709E-02). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability and reliability of the MR results. MST1 (macrophage stimulating 1) levels was inversely associated with IVDD, sciatica, and LBP risks. The results of cross-sectional study suggested that non-use of statins was positively correlated with LBP. The results of Mendelian randomization study suggest that NPC1L1 could lower the risk of developing IVDD by reducing TC, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C levels. Additionally, PCSK9 may reduce the risk of developing sciatica by lowering LDL-C and TC levels. In contrast, HMGCR appears to have no significant effect on IVDD, sciatica, or LBP development. Nonetheless, further research is needed to verify these preliminary results. MST1 warrants further exploration as a potential therapeutic target.

FinnGen,39090671,Exploring the causal effect between lipid-modifying drugs and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a drug-target Mendelian randomization study.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a respiratory disorder of obscure etiology and limited treatment options, possibly linked to dysregulation in lipid metabolism. While several observational studies suggest that lipid-lowering agents may decrease the risk of IPF, the evidence is inconsistent. The present Mendelian randomization (MR) study aims to determine the association between circulating lipid traits and IPF and to assess the potential influence of lipid-modifying medications for IPF. Summary statistics of 5 lipid traits (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, apolipoprotein A, and apolipoprotein B) and IPF were sourced from the UK Biobank and FinnGen Project Round 10. The study's focus on lipid-regulatory genes encompassed PCSK9, NPC1L1, ABCG5, ABCG8, HMGCR, APOB, LDLR, CETP, ANGPTL3, APOC3, LPL, and PPARA. The primary effect estimates were determined using the inverse-variance-weighted method, with additional analyses employing the contamination mixture method, robust adjusted profile score, the weighted median, weighted mode methods, and MR-Egger. Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) was used to confirm significant lipid-modifying drug targets, leveraging data on expressed quantitative trait loci in relevant tissues. Sensitivity analyses included assessments of heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and leave-one-out methods. There was no significant effect of blood lipid traits on IPF risk (all P＞0.05). Drug-target MR analysis indicated that genetic mimicry for inhibitor of NPC1L1, PCSK9, ABCG5, ABCG8, and APOC3 were associated with increased IPF risks, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as follows: 2.74 (1.05-7.12, P = 0.039), 1.36 (1.02-1.82, P = 0.037), 1.66 (1.12-2.45, P = 0.011), 1.68 (1.14-2.48, P = 0.009), and 1.42 (1.20-1.67, P = 3.17×10 Serum lipid traits did not significantly affect the risk of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

FinnGen,38220043,High-Resolution Genotyping of Formalin-Fixed Tissue Accurately Estimates Polygenic Risk Scores in Human Diseases.,"Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues stored in biobanks and pathology archives are a vast but underutilized source for molecular studies on different diseases. Beyond being the ""gold standard"" for preservation of diagnostic human tissues, FFPE samples retain similar genetic information as matching blood samples, which could make FFPE samples an ideal resource for genomic analysis. However, research on this resource has been hindered by the perception that DNA extracted from FFPE samples is of poor quality. Here, we show that germline disease-predisposing variants and polygenic risk scores (PRS) can be identified from FFPE normal tissue (FFPE-NT) DNA with high accuracy. We optimized the performance of FFPE-NT DNA on a genome-wide array containing 657,675 variants. Via a series of testing and validation phases, we established a protocol for FFPE-NT genotyping with results comparable with blood genotyping. The median call rate of FFPE-NT samples in the validation phase was 99.85% (range 98.26%-99.94%) and median concordance with matching blood samples was 99.79% (range 98.85%-99.9%). We also demonstrated that a rare pathogenic PALB2 genetic variant predisposing to cancer can be correctly identified in FFPE-NT samples. We further imputed the FFPE-NT genotype data and calculated the FFPE-NT genome-wide PRS in 3 diseases and 4 disease risk variables. In all cases, FFPE-NT and matching blood PRS were highly concordant (all Pearson's r > 0.95). The ability to precisely genotype FFPE-NT on a genome-wide array enables translational genomics applications of archived FFPE-NT samples with the possibility to link to corresponding phenotypes and longitudinal health data.",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2024,Humans; Formaldehyde; Genotype; Tissue Fixation; Genetic Risk Score; DNA; Paraffin Embedding,False,8
FinnGen,39741329,The association of cigarette smoking with the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy: based on cross-sectional survey and mendelian randomization.,"The relationship between cigarette smoking and diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains controversial, as existing studies have yielded inconsistent results. This study aimed to investigate the association between smoking and both the development and progression of DR. This study encompassed two complementary approaches. First, we performed a cross-sectional analysis to examine the association between smoking and DR, including its subcategories, utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Subsequently, we implemented Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the causal relationship between smoking and DR, as well as its specific categories, leveraging genome-wide association study data. The cross-sectional study found an inverse association between smoking and DR risk across three analytical models (fully adjusted OR = 0.50, P < 0.001) that still persisted after propensity score matching (OR = 0.56, P = 0.011), and MR analysis also supported this finding (OR = 0.50, P = 0.024). Subgroup analyses revealed significant protective associations in males (OR = 0.41, P < 0.001), individuals with diabetes duration ≥ 10 years (OR = 0.43, P = 0.011), and those with normal clinical parameters. After categorizing DR by severity levels, smoking showed protective associations with the onset of mild and moderate-severe non-proliferative DR in the cross-sectional study, and with the onset of proliferative DR in MR analysis (OR = 0.41, P = 0.016). However, no association was observed between smoking and DR progression.

FinnGen,38866767,A unified framework for estimating country-specific cumulative incidence for 18 diseases stratified by polygenic risk.,"Polygenic scores (PGSs) offer the ability to predict genetic risk for complex diseases across the life course; a key benefit over short-term prediction models. To produce risk estimates relevant to clinical and public health decision-making, it is important to account for varying effects due to age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases. We integrate PGS associations from seven studies in four countries (N = 1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGS has a significant sex-specific effect for asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes (T2D), with all but T2D exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS has a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with effects decreasing linearly with age. We show for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20% of polygenic risk, the top 5% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. Our framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting for age- and sex-specific PGS effects.

However, the biological intermediates driving this relationship are not fully understood. As novel interventions for treating and managing type 2 diabetes become increasingly available, whether they also disrupt the pathways leading to increased cancer risk is currently unknown. We investigated the effect of a type 2 diabetes intervention, in the form of intentional weight loss, on circulating proteins associated with cancer risk to gain insight into potential mechanisms linking type 2 diabetes and adiposity with cancer development. Fasting serum samples from participants with diabetes enrolled in the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) receiving the Counterweight-Plus weight-loss programme (intervention, N = 117, mean weight-loss 10 kg, 46% diabetes remission) or best-practice care by guidelines (control, N = 143, mean weight-loss 1 kg, 4% diabetes remission) were subject to proteomic analysis using the Olink Oncology-II platform (48% of participants were female; 52% male). To identify proteins which may be altered by the weight-loss intervention, the difference in protein levels between groups at baseline and 1 year was examined using linear regression. Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to extend these results to evaluate cancer risk and elucidate possible biological mechanisms linking type 2 diabetes and cancer development. MR analyses were conducted using independent datasets, including large cancer meta-analyses, UK Biobank, and FinnGen, to estimate potential causal relationships between proteins modified during intentional weight loss and the risk of colorectal, breast, endometrial, gallbladder, liver, and pancreatic cancers. Nine proteins were modified by the intervention: glycoprotein Nmb; furin; Wnt inhibitory factor 1; toll-like receptor 3; pancreatic prohormone; erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2; hepatocyte growth factor; endothelial cell specific molecule 1 and Ret proto-oncogene (Holm corrected P-value <0.05). Mendelian randomization analyses indicated a causal relationship between predicted circulating furin and glycoprotein Nmb on breast cancer risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.67-0.99, P-value = 0.03; and OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.78-0.99, P-value = 0.04 respectively), though these results were not supported in sensitivity analyses examining violations of MR assumptions. Intentional weight loss among individuals with recently diagnosed diabetes may modify levels of cancer-related proteins in serum. Further evaluation of the proteins identified in this analysis could reveal molecular pathways that mediate the effect of adiposity and type 2 diabetes on cancer risk.

FinnGen,38467730,Evidence for the additivity of rare and common variant burden throughout the spectrum of intellectual disability.,"Intellectual disability (ID) is a common disorder, yet there is a wide spectrum of impairment from mild to profoundly affected individuals. Mild ID is seen as the low extreme of the general distribution of intelligence, while severe ID is often seen as a monogenic disorder caused by rare, pathogenic, highly penetrant variants. To investigate the genetic factors influencing mild and severe ID, we evaluated rare and common variation in the Northern Finland Intellectual Disability cohort (n = 1096 ID patients), a cohort with a high percentage of mild ID (n = 550) and from a population bottleneck enriched in rare, damaging variation. Despite this enrichment, we found only a small percentage of ID was due to recessive Finnish-enriched variants (0.5%). A larger proportion was linked to dominant variation, with a significant burden of rare, damaging variation in both mild and severe ID. This rare variant burden was enriched in more severe ID (p = 2.4e-4), patients without a relative with ID (p = 4.76e-4), and in those with features associated with monogenic disorders. We also found a significant burden of common variants associated with decreased cognitive function, with no difference between mild and more severe ID. When we included common and rare variants in a joint model, the rare and common variants had additive effects in both mild and severe ID. A multimodel inference approach also found that common and rare variants together best explained ID status (ΔAIC = 16.8, ΔBIC = 10.2). Overall, we report evidence for the additivity of rare and common variant burden throughout the spectrum of intellectual disability.",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2024,Humans; Intellectual Disability; Male; Female; Finland; Adult; Genetic Variation,False,9
FinnGen,39137781,Transcriptome- and proteome-wide association studies identify genes associated with renal cell carcinoma.,"We performed a series of integrative analyses including transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) and proteome-wide association studies (PWASs) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to nominate and prioritize molecular targets for laboratory investigation. On the basis of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 29,020 affected individuals and 835,670 control individuals and prediction models trained in transcriptomic reference models, our TWAS across four kidney transcriptomes (GTEx kidney cortex, kidney tubules, TCGA-KIRC [The Cancer Genome Atlas kidney renal clear-cell carcinoma], and TCGA-KIRP [TCGA kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma]) identified 38 gene associations (false-discovery rate <5%) in at least two of four transcriptomic panels and identified 12 genes that were independent of GWAS susceptibility regions. Analyses combining TWAS associations across 48 tissues from GTEx identified associations that were replicable in tumor transcriptomes for 23 additional genes. Analyses by the two major histologic types (clear-cell RCC and papillary RCC) revealed subtype-specific associations, although at least three gene associations were common to both subtypes. PWAS identified 13 associated proteins, all mapping to GWAS-significant loci. TWAS-identified genes were enriched for active enhancer or promoter regions in RCC tumors and hypoxia-inducible factor binding sites in relevant cell lines. Using gene expression correlation, common cancers (breast and prostate) and RCC risk factors (e.g., hypertension and BMI) display genetic contributions shared with RCC. Our work identifies potential molecular targets for RCC susceptibility for downstream functional investigation.",American journal of human genetics,2024,"Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Kidney Neoplasms; Transcriptome; Proteome; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Gene Expression Profiling",False,7
FinnGen,38556557,"Genetic contribution to disease-course severity and progression in the SUPER-Finland study, a cohort of 10,403 individuals with psychotic disorders.","Genetic factors contribute to the susceptibility of psychotic disorders, but less is known how they affect psychotic disease-course development. Utilizing polygenic scores (PGSs) in combination with longitudinal healthcare data with decades of follow-up we investigated the contributing genetics to psychotic disease-course severity and diagnostic shifts in the SUPER-Finland study, encompassing 10 403 genotyped individuals with a psychotic disorder. To longitudinally track the study participants' past disease-course severity, we created a psychiatric hospitalization burden metric using the full-coverage and nation-wide Finnish in-hospital registry (data from 1969 and onwards). Using a hierarchical model, ranking the psychotic diagnoses according to clinical severity, we show that high schizophrenia PGS (SZ-PGS) was associated with progression from lower ranked psychotic disorders to schizophrenia (OR = 1.32 [1.23-1.43], p = 1.26e-12). This development manifested already at psychotic illness onset as a higher psychiatric hospitalization burden, the proxy for disease-course severity. In schizophrenia (n = 5 479), both a high SZ-PGS and a low educational attainment PGS (EA-PGS) were associated with increased psychiatric hospitalization burden (p = 1.00e-04 and p = 4.53e-10). The SZ-PGS and the EA-PGS associated with distinct patterns of hospital usage. In individuals with high SZ-PGS, the increased hospitalization burden was composed of longer individual hospital stays, while low EA-PGS associated with shorter but more frequent hospital visits. The negative effect of a low EA-PGS was found to be partly mediated via substance use disorder, a major risk factor for hospitalizations. In conclusion, we show that high SZ-PGS and low EA-PGS both impacted psychotic disease-course development negatively but resulted in different disease-course trajectories.",Molecular psychiatry,2024,Humans; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia; Male; Female; Finland; Disease Progression; Adult; Hospitalization; Multifactorial Inheritance; Severity of Illness Index; Middle Aged; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Genotype; Registries,False,9
FinnGen,39572784,Genome-wide association study reveals mechanisms underlying dilated cardiomyopathy and myocardial resilience.,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease that represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality, yet causal mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we perform a large-scale genome-wide association study and multitrait analysis for DCM using 9,365 cases and 946,368 controls. We identify 70 genome-wide significant loci, which show broad replication in independent samples and map to 63 prioritized genes. Tissue, cell type and pathway enrichment analyses highlight the central role of the cardiomyocyte and contractile apparatus in DCM pathogenesis. Polygenic risk scores constructed from our genome-wide association study predict DCM across different ancestry groups, show differing contributions to DCM depending on rare pathogenic variant status and associate with systolic heart failure across various clinical settings. Mendelian randomization analyses reveal actionable potential causes of DCM, including higher bodyweight and higher systolic blood pressure. Our findings provide insights into the genetic architecture and mechanisms underlying DCM and myocardial function more broadly.",Nature genetics,2024,"Cardiomyopathy, Dilated; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Multifactorial Inheritance; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Male; Myocardium; Female; Myocytes, Cardiac; Case-Control Studies; Mendelian Randomization Analysis",False,0
FinnGen,38804128,Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies Reveals Genetic Mechanisms of Supraventricular Arrhythmias.,"Substantial data support a heritable basis for supraventricular tachycardias, but the genetic determinants and molecular mechanisms of these arrhythmias are poorly understood. We sought to identify genetic loci associated with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and atrioventricular accessory pathways or atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVAPs/AVRT). We performed multiancestry meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies to identify genetic loci for AVNRT (4 studies) and AVAP/AVRT (7 studies). We assessed evidence supporting the potential causal effects of candidate genes by analyzing relations between associated variants and cardiac gene expression, performing transcriptome-wide analyses, and examining prior genome-wide association studies. Analyses comprised 2384 AVNRT cases and 106 489 referents, and 2811 AVAP/AVRT cases and 1,483 093 referents. We identified 2 significant loci for AVNRT, which implicate  Our findings highlight gene regions associated with ion channel function (AVAP/AVRT), as well as cardiac development and the sarcomere (AVAP/AVRT and AVNRT) as important potential effectors of supraventricular tachycardia susceptibility.",Circulation.

In analyses stratified by subtype, 52 regions (78 loci) were associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and 6 regions (7 loci) with papillary RCC. Notably, we report a variant common in African ancestry individuals ( rs7629500 ) in the 3' untranslated region of VHL, nearly tripling clear cell RCC risk (odds ratio 2.72, 95% confidence interval 2.23-3.30). In cis-expression quantitative trait locus analyses, 48 variants from 34 regions point toward 83 candidate genes. Enrichment of hypoxia-inducible factor-binding sites underscores the importance of hypoxia-related mechanisms in kidney cancer.

FinnGen,38637617,Genome-wide association analyses identify 95 risk loci and provide insights into the neurobiology of post-traumatic stress disorder.,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) genetics are characterized by lower discoverability than most other psychiatric disorders. The contribution to biological understanding from previous genetic studies has thus been limited. We performed a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies across 1,222,882 individuals of European ancestry (137,136 cases) and 58,051 admixed individuals with African and Native American ancestry (13,624 cases). We identified 95 genome-wide significant loci (80 new). Convergent multi-omic approaches identified 43 potential causal genes, broadly classified as neurotransmitter and ion channel synaptic modulators (for example, GRIA1, GRM8 and CACNA1E), developmental, axon guidance and transcription factors (for example, FOXP2, EFNA5 and DCC), synaptic structure and function genes (for example, PCLO, NCAM1 and PDE4B) and endocrine or immune regulators (for example, ESR1, TRAF3 and TANK). Additional top genes influence stress, immune, fear and threat-related processes, previously hypothesized to underlie PTSD neurobiology.

FinnGen,39902040,Effect of trace elements and nutrients on 21 autoimmune diseases: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Numerous clinical studies have observed a close relationship between serum trace elements, nutrients, and autoimmune diseases. However, whether there is a genetic causal effect between serum trace elements, nutrients, and autoimmune diseases remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the causal effects of serum trace elements and nutrients on 21 autoimmune diseases using Mendelian randomization (MR). Single nucleotide polymorphisms for the exposure factors (serum trace elements and vitamins) were obtained from the published UK Biobank database and genome-wide association study (GWAS) public databases. Outcome GWAS data were derived from the FinnGen database. MR was employed to explore the causal relationships between 9 trace elements and 6 vitamins and autoimmune diseases. Causal inference was performed using inverse variance weighted methods, MR Egger, and weighted median methods. Subsequently, heterogeneity tests, horizontal pleiotropy tests, MR-PRESSO tests, and leave-one-out analyses were conducted for sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the study results. Finally, trace elements and vitamins that were statistically significant in the IVW method and had consistent effect sizes and odds ratios across five methods were selected as exposure factors with a causal relationship to diabetes and its complications. Additionally, multivariable Mendelian randomization was employed to assess the combined effects of multiple exposure factors on autoimmune diseases. MR analysis indicated that elevated levels of the trace element copper were associated with an increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a decreased risk of ulcerative colitis. Carotene was found to have a negative causal relationship with adult-onset Still The findings from both univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization studies support a causal relationship between trace elements, nutrients, and autoimmune diseases.

However, the casual association between telomere length (TL) and hyperthyroidism remains unclear. We aim to explore the casual relationship between TL and hyperthyroidism. A two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis employed the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, supplemented by additional approaches such as Weighted Median (WM), and MR Egger. The summary statistics for TL were derived from the UK Biobank, comprising 472,174 individuals, while the data for hyperthyroidism were sourced from the GWAS Catalog and the FinnGen database, encompassing cohorts of 460,499 and 173,938 individuals, respectively. Utilizing 139 genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables (IVs) for TL, forward MR analyses indicated a negative causal effect of TL on hyperthyroidism. The risk of hyperthyroidism decreased as genetically predicted TL increased by one standard deviation, as determined by the IVW form GWAS Catalog (OR:0.659,95%CI: 0.541-0.802,  The finding that longer telomeres reduce hyperthyroidism risk highlights the need to validate hyperthyroidism's impact on telomere length, offering valuable insights for prevention and treatment.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024,"Humans; Hyperthyroidism; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genome-Wide Association Study; Female; Telomere; Telomere Homeostasis; Genetic Predisposition to Disease",False,8

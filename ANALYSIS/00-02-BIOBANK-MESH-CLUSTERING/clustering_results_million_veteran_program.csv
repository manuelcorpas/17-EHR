Million Veteran Program,14638957,Contrast letter acuity as a visual component for the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite.,"Visual dysfunction is one of the most common causes of disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), a new clinical trial outcome measure, does not currently include a test of visual function. To examine contrast letter acuity as a candidate visual function test for the MSFC. Binocular contrast letter acuity testing (Sloan charts) was performed in a subgroup of participants from the International Multiple Sclerosis Secondary Progressive Avonex Controlled Trial (IMPACT Substudy) and in MS patients and disease-free control subjects from a cross-sectional study of visual outcome measures (Multiple Sclerosis Vision Prospective cohort [MVP cohort]). High-contrast visual acuity was measured in both studies; MVP cohort participants underwent additional binocular testing for contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson chart), color vision (D-15 desaturated test), and visual field (Esterman test, Humphrey Field Analyzer II). Contrast letter acuity (Sloan charts, p < 0.0001, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis) and contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson chart, p = 0.003) best distinguished MS patients from disease-free control subjects in the MVP cohort. Correlations of Sloan chart scores with MSFC and Expanded Disability Statue Scale (EDSS) scores in both studies were significant and moderate in magnitude, demonstrating that Sloan chart scores reflect visual and neurologic dysfunction not entirely captured by the EDSS or MSFC. Among clinical measures, contrast letter acuity (Sloan charts) and contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson chart) demonstrate the greatest capacity to identify binocular visual dysfunction in MS. Sloan chart testing also captures unique aspects of neurologic dysfunction not captured by current EDSS or MSFC components, making it a strong candidate visual function test for the MSFC.",Neurology,2003,Adult; Contrast Sensitivity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Sclerosis; Vision Tests; Visual Acuity,False,2
Million Veteran Program,22538255,Preferences for opt-in and opt-out enrollment and consent models in biobank research: a national survey of Veterans Administration patients.,"In 2006, the Department of Veterans Affairs launched the Genomic Medicine Program with the goal of using genomic information to personalize and improve health care for veterans. A step toward this goal is the Million Veteran Program, which aims to enroll a million veterans in a longitudinal cohort study and establish a database with genomic, lifestyle, military-exposure, and health information. Before the launch of the Million Veteran Program, a survey of Department of Veterans Affairs patients was conducted to measure preferences for opt-in and opt-out models of enrollment and consent. An online survey was conducted with a random sample of 451 veterans. The survey described the proposed Million Veteran Program database and asked respondents about the acceptability of opt-in and opt-out models of enrollment. The study examined differences in responses among demographic groups and relationships between beliefs about each model and willingness to participate. Most respondents were willing to participate under both opt-in (80%) and opt-out (69%) models. Nearly 80% said they would be comfortable providing access to residual clinical samples for research. At least half of respondents did not strongly favor one model over the other; of those who expressed a preference, significantly more people said they would participate in a study using opt-in methods. Stronger preferences for the opt-in approach were expressed among younger patients and Hispanic patients. Support for the study and willingness to participate were high for both enrollment models. The use of an opt-out model could impede recruitment of certain demographic groups, including Hispanic patients and patients under the age of 55 years.",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2012,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Biological Specimen Banks; Biomedical Research; Cohort Studies; Data Collection; Decision Support Techniques; Ethics, Research; Female; Genomics; Humans; Informed Consent; Male; Middle Aged; Racial Groups; United States; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans",False,0
Million Veteran Program,24687382,"Expression of cereblon protein assessed by immunohistochemicalstaining in myeloma cells is associated with superior response of thalidomide- and lenalidomide-based treatment, but not bortezomib-based treatment, in patients with multiple myeloma.","Cereblon (CRBN) is essential for the anti-myeloma (MM) activity of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), such as thalidomide and lenalidomide. However, the clinical implications of CRBN in MM patients are unclear. Using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining on paraffin-embedded bone marrow sections, the expression of CRBN protein in myeloma cells (MCs) was assessed in 40 relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM) patients who received lenalidomide/dexamethasone (LD) and 45 and 22 newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) patients who received thalidomide/dexamethasone (TD) and melphalan/bortezomib/prednisolone (MVP), respectively. IHC staining were scored on a scale representing the diffuseness and intensity of positive-staining MCs (range, 0-8) and a score ≥4.5 was used for CRBN positivity (CRBN(+)) on a cut-point analysis of all possible scores and response of TD and LD. Compared to CRBN(+) NDMM patients, CRBN(-) NDMM patients had more international staging system (ISS) III (26 vs. 61 %, respectively; P = 0.006). In the LD and TD cohorts, the response rate (RR) was higher in CRBN(+) patients than CRBN(-) patients (LD 79 vs. 33 %, respectively; P = 0.005) (TD 75 vs. 29 %, respectively; P = 0.005); however, this trend was not observed in the MVP cohort. In the LD and TD cohorts, the positive and negative prediction value of CRBN(+) for treatment response was 79 and 67 % and 75 and 71 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that CRBN(+) was a significant factor associated with superior RR for LD and TD. The data suggest that expression of CRBN protein in MCs assessed using the IHC is a feasible approach to predict the response of IMiDs in MM patients.",Annals of hematology,2014,"Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Aged; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Bone Marrow Examination; Boronic Acids; Bortezomib; Dexamethasone; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Lenalidomide; Male; Melphalan; Middle Aged; Multiple Myeloma; Neoplasm Proteins; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Paraffin Embedding; Peptide Hydrolases; Prednisolone; Pyrazines; Salvage Therapy; Survival Analysis; Syndecan-1; Thalidomide; Treatment Outcome; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases",False,8
Million Veteran Program,26441289,Million Veteran Program: A mega-biobank to study genetic influences on health and disease.,"To describe the design and ongoing conduct of the Million Veteran Program (MVP), as an observational cohort study and mega-biobank in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Data are being collected from participants using questionnaires, the VA electronic health record, and a blood sample for genomic and other testing. Several ongoing projects are linked to MVP, both as peer-reviewed research studies and as activities to help develop an infrastructure for future, broad-based research uses. Formal planning for MVP commenced in 2009; the protocol was approved in 2010, and enrollment began in 2011. As of August 3, 2015, and with a steady state of ≈50 recruiting sites nationwide, N = 397,104 veterans have been enrolled. Among N = 199,348 with currently available genotyping data, most participants (as expected) are male (92.0%) between the ages of 50 and 69 years (55.0%). On the basis of self-reported race, white (77.2%) and African American (13.5%) populations are well represented. By helping to promote the future integration of genetic testing in health care delivery, including clinical decision making, the MVP is designed to contribute to the development of precision medicine.",Journal of clinical epidemiology,2016,Biological Specimen Banks; Data Collection; Electronic Health Records; Female; Genomics; Genotype; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Research Design; Sequence Analysis; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; Veterans,False,5

Million Veteran Program,27237867,Accelerating the Development and Validation of New Value-Based Diagnostics by Leveraging Biobanks.,"The challenges faced in developing value-based diagnostics has resulted in few of these tests reaching the clinic, leaving many treatment modalities without matching diagnostics to select patients for particular therapies. Many patients receive therapies from which they are unlikely to benefit, resulting in worse outcomes and wasted health care resources. The paucity of value-based diagnostics is a result of the scientific challenges in developing predictive markers, specifically: (1) complex biology, (2) a limited research infrastructure supporting diagnostic development, and (3) the lack of incentives for diagnostic developers to invest the necessary resources. Better access to biospecimens can address some of these challenges. Methodologies developed to evaluate biomarkers from biospecimens archived from patients enrolled in randomized clinical trials offer the greatest opportunity to develop and validate high-value molecular diagnostics. An alternative opportunity is to access high-quality biospecimens collected from large public and private longitudinal observational cohorts such as the UK Biobank, the US Million Veteran Program, the UK 100,000 Genomes Project, or the French E3N cohort. Value-based diagnostics can be developed to work in a range of samples including blood, serum, plasma, urine, and tumour tissue, and better access to these high-quality biospecimens with clinical data can facilitate biomarker research.",Public health genomics,2016,"Biological Specimen Banks; Humans; Informed Consent; Pathology, Molecular; Precision Medicine; Value-Based Purchasing",False,1

Million Veteran Program,29753396,Prevalence of Ideal Cardiovascular Health Metrics in the Million Veteran Program.,"No data exist on the prevalence of ideal cardiovascular health metrics in a national sample of U.S. veterans. We assessed the prevalence of ideal Life's Simple Seven (LSS) metrics in a cross-sectional study of 554,855 U.S. veterans enrolled in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) from 2011 to 2017. We used the American Heart Association's established criteria to categorize each LSS metric as either poor, intermediate, or ideal for a veteran at time of MVP enrollment. Information on adiposity/body mass index, smoking status, diet, and physical activity was obtained from self-reported survey data, and clinical measurements for total cholesterol, blood pressure, and plasma glucose were obtained from electronic health records. Complete data on all LSS health factors were available for 201,745 veterans. The prevalence of having 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 ideal cardiovascular health metrics was 29.2%, 34.6%, 22.6%, 10.0%, 3.0%, 0.6%, <0.1%, and 0%, respectively. The frequency of ideal body mass index, physical activity, smoking status, total cholesterol, blood pressure, and plasma glucose was 19.4%, 3.8%, 27.0%, 21.8%, 17.8%, and 34.5%, respectively, in our study population. Among the 7 metrics, MVP participants were least likely to achieve ideal diet (0.4%), particularly the recommendation for fruit and vegetable (at least 4.5 cups/day) intake. Our data show an extremely low prevalence of ideal cardiovascular health factors among veterans in the MVP, especially for diet and physical activity.

Million Veteran Program,29580627,Alcohol Consumption and Risk of Coronary Artery Disease (from the Million Veteran Program).,"Moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with a lower risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the general population but has not been well studied in US veterans. We obtained self-reported alcohol consumption from Million Veteran Program participants. Using electronic health records, CAD events were defined as 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient diagnosis codes for CAD, or 1 code for a coronary procedure. We excluded participants with prevalent CAD (n = 69,995) or incomplete alcohol information (n = 8,449). We used a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for CAD, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, race, smoking, education, and exercise. Among 156,728 participants, the mean age was 65.3 years (standard deviation = 12.1) and 91% were men. There were 6,153 CAD events during a mean follow-up of 2.9 years. Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for CAD were 1.00 (reference), 1.02 (0.92 to 1.13), 0.83 (0.74 to 0.93), 0.77 (0.67 to 0.87), 0.71 (0.62 to 0.81), 0.62 (0.51 to 0.76), 0.58 (0.46 to 0.74), and 0.95 (0.85 to 1.06) for categories of never drinker; former drinker; current drinkers of ≤0.5 drink/day, >0.5 to 1 drink/day, >1 to 2 drinks/day, >2 to 3 drinks/day, and >3 to 4 drinks/day; and heavy drinkers (>4 drinks/day) or alcohol use disorder, respectively. For a fixed amount of ethanol, intake at ≥3 days/week was associated with lower CAD risk compared with ≤1 day/week. Beverage preference (beer, wine, or liquor) did not influence the alcohol-CAD relation.

We tested the hypothesis that adherence to Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) food pattern is associated with a lower risk of developing CAD among veterans. We analyzed data on 153 802 participants of the Million Veteran Program enrolled between 2011 and 2016. Information on dietary habits was obtained using a food frequency questionnaire at enrollment. We used electronic health records to assess the development of CAD during follow-up. Of the 153 802 veterans who provided information on diet and were free of CAD at baseline, the mean age was 64.0 (SD=11.8) years and 90.4% were men.

Million Veteran Program,29844141,Interdisciplinary Models for Research and Clinical Endeavors in Genomic Medicine: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,"The completion of the Human Genome Project has unleashed a wealth of human genomics information, but it remains unclear how best to implement this information for the benefit of patients. The standard approach of biomedical research, with researchers pursuing advances in knowledge in the laboratory and, separately, clinicians translating research findings into the clinic as much as decades later, will need to give way to new interdisciplinary models for research in genomic medicine. These models should include scientists and clinicians actively working as teams to study patients and populations recruited in clinical settings and communities to make genomics discoveries-through the combined efforts of data scientists, clinical researchers, epidemiologists, and basic scientists-and to rapidly apply these discoveries in the clinic for the prediction, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. The highly publicized US Precision Medicine Initiative, also known as All of Us, is a large-scale program funded by the US National Institutes of Health that will energize these efforts, but several ongoing studies such as the UK Biobank Initiative; the Million Veteran Program; the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network; the Kaiser Permanente Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health; and the DiscovEHR collaboration are already providing exemplary models of this kind of interdisciplinary work.

Million Veteran Program,29972609,AUDIT-C and ICD codes as phenotypes for harmful alcohol use: association with ADH1B polymorphisms in two US populations.,"Longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data offer a large-scale, untapped source of phenotypical information on harmful alcohol use. Using established, alcohol-associated variants in the gene that encodes the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) as criterion standards, we compared the individual and combined validity of three longitudinal EHR-based phenotypes of harmful alcohol use: Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) trajectories; mean age-adjusted AUDIT-C; and diagnoses of alcohol use disorder (AUD). With longitudinal EHR data from the Million Veteran Program (MVP) linked to genetic data, we used two population-specific polymorphisms in ADH1B that are associated strongly with AUD in African Americans (AAs) and European Americans (EAs): rs2066702 (Arg369Cys, AAs) and rs1229984 (Arg48His, EAs) as criterion measures. United States Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. A total of 167 721 veterans (57 677 AAs and 110 044 EAs; 92% male, mean age = 63 years) took part in this study. Data were collected from 1  October 2007 to 1 May 2017. Using all AUDIT-C scores and AUD diagnostic codes recorded in the EHR, we calculated age-adjusted mean AUDIT-C values, longitudinal statistical trajectories of AUDIT-C scores and ICD-9/10 diagnostic groupings for AUD. A total of 19 793 AAs (34.3%) had one or two minor alleles at rs2066702 [minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.190] and 6933 EAs (6.3%) had one or two minor alleles at rs1229984 (MAF = 0.032). In both populations, trajectories and age-adjusted mean AUDIT-C were correlated (r = 0.90) but, when considered separately, highest score (8+ versus 0) of age-adjusted mean AUDIT-C demonstrated a stronger association with the ADH1B variants [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.54 in AAs and 0.37 in AAs] than did the highest trajectory (aOR 0.71 in AAs and 0.53 in EAs); combining AUDIT-C metrics did not improve discrimination. When age-adjusted mean AUDIT-C score and AUD diagnoses were considered together, age-adjusted mean AUDIT-C (8+ versus 0) was associated with lower odds of having the ADH1B minor allele than were AUD diagnostic codes: aOR = 0.59 versus 0.86 in AAs and 0.48 versus 0.68 in EAs. These independent associations combine to yield an even lower aOR of 0.51 for AAs and 0.33 for EAs. The age-adjusted mean AUDIT-C score is associated more strongly with genetic polymorphisms of known risk for alcohol use disorder than are longitudinal trajectories of AUDIT-C or AUD diagnostic codes. AUD diagnostic codes modestly enhance this association.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",2018,"Black or African American; Aged; Alcohol Dehydrogenase; Alcoholism; Disease Progression; Electronic Health Records; Female; Humans; International Classification of Diseases; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; White People",False,2
Million Veteran Program,30090940,Association of Interleukin 6 Receptor Variant With Cardiovascular Disease Effects of Interleukin 6 Receptor Blocking Therapy: A Phenome-Wide Association Study.,"Electronic health record (EHR) biobanks containing clinical and genomic data on large numbers of individuals have great potential to inform drug discovery. Individuals with interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) who are not receiving IL6R blocking therapy have biomarker profiles similar to those treated with IL6R blockers. This gene-drug pair provides an example to test whether associations of IL6R SNPs with a broad range of phenotypes can inform which diseases may benefit from treatment with IL6R blockade. To determine whether screening for clinical associations with the IL6R SNP in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) using EHR biobank data can identify drug effects from IL6R clinical trials. Diagnosis codes and routine laboratory measurements were extracted from the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP); diagnosis codes were mapped to phenotype groups using published PheWAS methods. A PheWAS was performed by fitting logistic regression models for testing associations of the IL6R SNPs with 1342 phenotype groups and by fitting linear regression models for testing associations of the IL6R SNP with 26 routine laboratory measurements. Significance was reported using a false discovery rate of 0.05 or less. Findings were replicated in 2 independent cohorts using UK Biobank and Vanderbilt University Biobank data. The Million Veteran Program included 332 799 US veterans; the UK Biobank, 408 455 individuals from the general population of the United Kingdom; and the Vanderbilt University Biobank, 13 835 patients from a tertiary care center. IL6R SNPs (rs2228145; rs4129267). Phenotypes defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Of the 332 799 veterans included in the main cohort, 305 228 (91.7%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 66.1 (13.6) years. The IL6R SNP was most strongly associated with a reduced risk of aortic aneurysm phenotypes (odds ratio, 0.87-0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.93) in the MVP. We observed known off-target effects of IL6R blockade from clinical trials (eg, higher hemoglobin level). The reduced risk for aortic aneurysms among those with the IL6R SNP in the MVP was replicated in the Vanderbilt University Biobank, and the reduced risk for coronary heart disease was replicated in the UK Biobank. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated application of the PheWAS using large EHR biobanks to inform drug effects. The findings of an association of the IL6R SNP with reduced risk for aortic aneurysms correspond with the newest indication for IL6R blockade, giant cell arteritis, of which a major complication is aortic aneurysm.",JAMA cardiology,2018,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Aortic Aneurysm; Cardiovascular Diseases; Current Procedural Terminology; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Proof of Concept Study; Receptors, Interleukin-6; Veterans",False,1

In a multi-ethnic cohort including over 30,000 PTSD cases and 170,000 controls we conduct a genome-wide association study of PTSD. We demonstrate SNP-based heritability estimates of 5-20%, varying by sex. Three genome-wide significant loci are identified, 2 in European and 1 in African-ancestry analyses. Analyses stratified by sex implicate 3 additional loci in men. Along with other novel genes and non-coding RNAs, a Parkinson's disease gene involved in dopamine regulation, PARK2, is associated with PTSD. Finally, we demonstrate that polygenic risk for PTSD is significantly predictive of re-experiencing symptoms in the Million Veteran Program dataset, although specific loci did not replicate. These results demonstrate the role of genetic variation in the biology of risk for PTSD and highlight the necessity of conducting sex-stratified analyses and expanding GWAS beyond European ancestry populations.",Nature communications,2019,"Black People; Datasets as Topic; Female; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Sex Factors; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases; Veterans; White People",False,6

The objectives of this study were to examine gender differences in the MVP cohort with respect to response and enrollment rates; demographic, health, and health care characteristics; and prevalence of self-reported health conditions. The MVP Baseline Survey was completed by 415,694 veterans (8% women), providing self-report measures of demographic characteristics, health status, and medical history. Relative to men, women demonstrated a higher positive responder rate (23.0% vs. 16.0%), slightly higher enrollment rate (13.5% vs. 12.9%), and, among enrollees, a lower survey completion rate (59.7% vs. 63.8%). Women were younger, more racially diverse, had higher educational attainment, and were less likely to be married or cohabitating with a partner than men. Women were more likely to report good to excellent health status but poorer physical fitness, and less likely to report lifetime smoking and drinking than men. Compared with men, women veterans showed an increased prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions, thyroid problems, gastrointestinal conditions, migraine headaches, and mental health disorders, as well as a decreased prevalence of gout, cardiovascular diseases, high cholesterol, diabetes, and hearing problems. These results revealed some substantial gender differences in the research participation rates, demographic profile, health characteristics, and prevalence of health conditions for veterans in the MVP cohort.

Million Veteran Program,31420334,Genomic and transcriptomic association studies identify 16 novel susceptibility loci for venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. To advance our understanding of the biology contributing to VTE, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of VTE and a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) based on imputed gene expression from whole blood and liver. We meta-analyzed GWAS data from 18 studies for 30 234 VTE cases and 172 122 controls and assessed the association between 12 923 718 genetic variants and VTE. We generated variant prediction scores of gene expression from whole blood and liver tissue and assessed them for association with VTE. Mendelian randomization analyses were conducted for traits genetically associated with novel VTE loci. We identified 34 independent genetic signals for VTE risk from GWAS meta-analysis, of which 14 are newly reported associations. This included 11 newly associated genetic loci (C1orf198, PLEK, OSMR-AS1, NUGGC/SCARA5, GRK5, MPHOSPH9, ARID4A, PLCG2, SMG6, EIF5A, and STX10) of which 6 replicated, and 3 new independent signals in 3 known genes. Further, TWAS identified 5 additional genetic loci with imputed gene expression levels differing between cases and controls in whole blood (SH2B3, SPSB1, RP11-747H7.3, RP4-737E23.2) and in liver (ERAP1). At some GWAS loci, we found suggestive evidence that the VTE association signal for novel and previously known regions colocalized with expression quantitative trait locus signals. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested that blood traits may contribute to the underlying risk of VTE.

Million Veteran Program,30592535,Longitudinal Drinking Patterns and Their Clinical Correlates in Million Veteran Program Participants.,"A variety of measures have been developed to screen for hazardous or harmful drinking. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) is one of the screening measures recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Annual administration of the AUDIT-C to all primary care patients is required by the U.S. Veterans Affairs Health System. The availability of data from the repeated administration of this instrument over time in a large patient population provides an opportunity to evaluate the utility of the AUDIT-C for identifying distinct drinking groups. Using data from the Million Veteran Program cohort, we modeled group-based drinking trajectories using 2,833,189 AUDIT-C scores from 495,178 Veterans across an average 6-year time period. We also calculated patients' age-adjusted mean AUDIT-C scores to compare to the drinking trajectories. Finally, we extracted data on selected clinical diagnoses from the electronic health record and assessed their associations with the drinking trajectories. Of the trajectory models, the 4-group model demonstrated the best fit to the data. AUDIT-C trajectories were highly correlated with the age-adjusted mean AUDIT-C scores (rs = 0.94). Those with an alcohol use disorder diagnosis had 10 times the odds of being in the highest trajectory group (consistently hazardous/harmful) compared to the lowest drinking trajectory group (infrequent). Those with hepatitis C, posttraumatic stress disorder, liver cirrhosis, and delirium had 10, 7, 21, and 34%, respectively, higher odds of being classified in the highest drinking trajectory group versus the lowest drinking trajectory group. Trajectories and age-adjusted mean scores are potentially useful approaches to optimize the information provided by the AUDIT-C. In contrast to trajectories, age-adjusted mean AUDIT-C scores also have clinical relevance for real-time identification of individuals for whom an intervention may be warranted.","Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",2019,"Alcohol Drinking; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Psychological; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; United States; Veterans",False,2

We tested the hypothesis that frequent fried food consumption is associated with a higher risk of incident CAD events in Million Veteran Program (MVP) participants. Veterans Health Administration electronic health record data were linked to questionnaires completed at MVP enrollment. Self-reported fried food consumption at baseline was categorized: (<1, 1-3, 4-6 times per week or daily). The outcome of interest was non-fatal myocardial infarction or CAD events. We fitted a Cox regression model adjusting for age, sex, race, education, exercise, smoking and alcohol consumption. Of 154,663 MVP enrollees with survey data, mean age was 64 years and 90% were men. During a mean follow-up of approximately 3 years, there were 6,725 CAD events. There was a positive linear relationship between frequency of fried food consumption and risk of CAD (p for trend 0.0015). Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) were 1.0 (ref), 1.07 (1.01-1.13), 1.08 (1.01-1.16), and 1.14 (1.03-1.27) across consecutive increasing categories of fried food intake.

Probable cases (with PTSD) and probable controls (without PTSD) were identified from among veterans enrolled in the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP) with an algorithm developed using questionnaire responses and electronic health record information. This algorithm, based on a statistical model, relied on medical chart reviews as a reference standard and was refined using telephone interviews. Subsequently, to evaluate the impact of probabilistic phenotyping on statistical power, the threshold probability for case-control selection was varied in simulations. As of September 2018, >695,000 veterans have enrolled in MVP. For current analyses, genotyping data were available for >353,000 participants, including >83,000 combat-exposed veterans.

We tested the primary hypothesis that egg consumption is positively associated with incidence of MI among veterans. In secondary analyses, we examined potential effect modification of egg-MI relation by adiposity and type 2 diabetes. We analyzed data collected on 188,267 US veterans who were enrolled in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) from 2011 to 2018. Information on egg consumption was obtained via self-administered food frequency questionnaire and we used electronic health records to identify incident MI. The mean age was 64.4 (SD = 12.0) years and 9.9% of the population were female. We ascertained 10,260 new cases of non-fatal MI during an average follow up of 3.24 years (range: 0.002 to 7.49 y). Hazard ratio (95% CI) for non-fatal MI were 1.00 (ref), 0.93 (0.85-0.1.02), 0.96 (0.87-1.05), 0.98 (0.89-1.07), 1.08 (0.98-1.19), 1.11 (1.00-1.24), and 1.13 (1.00-1.28) for egg consumption of <1/month, 1-3/month, 1/week, 2-4/week, 5-6/week, 1/d, and 2+/d, respectively, controlling for age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, exercise, alcohol intake, and overall dietary pattern (p non-linear trend 0.019).

The results were replicated in an independent sample of 5,117 PAD cases and 389,291 controls from the UK Biobank. We identified 19 PAD loci, 18 of which have not been previously reported. Eleven of the 19 loci were associated with disease in three vascular beds (coronary, cerebral, peripheral), including LDLR, LPL and LPA, suggesting that therapeutic modulation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the lipoprotein lipase pathway or circulating lipoprotein(a) may be efficacious for multiple atherosclerotic disease phenotypes. Conversely, four of the variants appeared to be specific for PAD, including F5 p.R506Q, highlighting the pathogenic role of thrombosis in the peripheral vascular bed and providing genetic support for Factor Xa inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for PAD.

Recent research suggests genetic links to several cognitive phenotypes in both SMI and in the general population. Our goal in this study was to identify potential genomic signatures of cognitive functioning in veterans with severe mental illness and compare them to previous findings for cognition across different populations. Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) Study #572 evaluated cognitive and functional capacity measures among SZ and BP patients. In conjunction with the VA Million Veteran Program, 3,959 European American (1,095 SZ, 2,864 BP) and 2,601 African American (1,095 SZ, 2,864 BP) patients were genotyped using a custom Affymetrix Axiom Biobank array. We performed a genome-wide association study of global cognitive functioning, constructed polygenic scores for SZ and cognition in the general population, and examined genetic correlations with 2,626 UK Biobank traits. Although no single locus attained genome-wide significance, observed allelic effects were strongly consistent with previous studies. We observed robust associations between global cognitive functioning and polygenic scores for cognitive performance, intelligence, and SZ risk. We also identified significant genetic correlations with several cognition-related traits in UK Biobank. In a diverse cohort of U.S. veterans with SZ or BP, we demonstrate broad overlap of common genetic effects on cognition in the general population, and find that greater polygenic loading for SZ risk is associated with poorer cognitive performance.","American journal of medical genetics.

We investigated whether omega-3 fatty acid supplement use and fish intake were associated with incident non-fatal CAD and ischemic stroke among US Veterans. The Million Veteran Program (MVP) is an ongoing nation-wide longitudinal cohort study of US Veterans with self-reported survey, biospecimen, and electronic health record data. Regular use of omega-3 supplements (yes/no) and frequency of fish intake within the past year were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations of omega-3 supplement use and fish intake with incident non-fatal CAD and ischemic stroke, defined from electronic health records using validated algorithms. Multivariable models included demographics, body mass index, education, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise frequency. Among 197,761 participants with food frequency data (mean age: 66 ± 12 years, 92% men), 21% regularly took omega-3 supplements and median fish intake was 1 (3-5 ounce) serving/week. Over a median follow-up of 2.9 years for non-fatal CAD and 3.3 years for non-fatal ischemic stroke, we observed 6265 and 4042 incident cases of non-fatal CAD and non-fatal ischemic stroke, respectively.

Million Veteran Program,31009556,Validation of an Electronic Medical Record-Based Algorithm for Identifying Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in U.S. Veterans.,"We developed an algorithm for identifying U.S. veterans with a history of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), using the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic medical record (EMR) system. This work was motivated by the need to create a valid EMR-based phenotype to identify thousands of cases and controls for a genome-wide association study of PTSD in veterans. We used manual chart review (n = 500) as the gold standard. For both the algorithm and chart review, three classifications were possible: likely PTSD, possible PTSD, and likely not PTSD. We used Lasso regression with cross-validation to select statistically significant predictors of PTSD from the EMR and then generate a predicted probability score of being a PTSD case for every participant in the study population (range: 0-1.00). Comparing the performance of our probabilistic approach (Lasso algorithm) to a rule-based approach (International Classification of Diseases [ICD] algorithm), the Lasso algorithm showed modestly higher overall percent agreement with chart review than the ICD algorithm (80% vs. 75%), higher sensitivity (0.95 vs. 0.84), and higher accuracy (AUC = 0.95 vs. 0.90). We applied a 0.7 probability cut-point to the Lasso results to determine final PTSD case-control status for the VA population. The final algorithm had a 0.99 sensitivity, 0.99 specificity, 0.95 positive predictive value, and 1.00 negative predictive value for PTSD classification (grouping possible PTSD and likely not PTSD) as determined by chart review. This algorithm may be useful for other research and quality improvement endeavors within the VA.

UU. VALIDACIÓN DE ALGORITOMO DE TEPT Desarrollamos un algoritmo para identificar a los veteranos de EE. UU. con historial de trastorno de estrés postraumático (TEPT), utilizando el sistema de registro médico electrónico (RME) del Departamento de Asuntos de Veteranos (AS). Este trabajo fue motivado por la necesidad de crear un fenotipo válido, basado en RME para identificar miles de casos y controles para un estudio de asociación del genoma del TEPT en los veteranos. Utilizamos la revisión manual de tablas (n = 500) como gold estándar. Tanto para el algoritmo como para la revisión de la tabla, fueron posibles tres clasificaciones: PTSD probable, PTSD posible y probablemente no PTSD. Usamos la regresión Lasso con validación cruzada para seleccionar los factores de pronóstico estadísticamente significativos del TEPT a partir de la RME y luego generar una puntuación de probabilidad pronosticada de ser un caso de TEPT para cada participante en la población del estudio (rango: 0-1.00). Comparando el rendimiento de nuestro enfoque probabilístico (algoritmo Lasso) con un enfoque basado en reglas (algoritmo de Clasificación Internacional de Enfermedades [CIE]), el algoritmo Lasso mostró un porcentaje de acuerdo global modestamente más alto con la revisión de tablas que el algoritmo CIE (80% vs. 75). %), mayor sensibilidad (0.95 frente a 0.84) y mayor precisión (AUC = 0.95 frente a 0.90).

In total, 10 previously identified risk loci explain a small fraction of AAA heritability. We performed a genome-wide association study in the Million Veteran Program testing ≈18 million DNA sequence variants with AAA (7642 cases and 172 172 controls) in veterans of European ancestry with independent replication in up to 4972 cases and 99 858 controls. We then used mendelian randomization to examine the causal effects of blood pressure on AAA. We examined the association of AAA risk variants with aneurysms in the lower extremity, cerebral, and iliac arterial beds, and derived a genome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) to identify a subset of the population at greater risk for disease. Through a genome-wide association study, we identified 14 novel loci, bringing the total number of known significant AAA loci to 24. In our mendelian randomization analysis, we demonstrate that a genetic increase of 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.24-1.66];  We identify novel AAA genetic associations with therapeutic implications and identify a subset of the population at significantly increased genetic risk of AAA independent of family history.

Million Veteran Program,32300774,Genetic predisposition to smoking in relation to 14 cardiovascular diseases.,"The aim of this study was to use Mendelian randomization (MR) to determine the causality of the association between smoking and 14 different cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Our primary genetic instrument comprised 361 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with smoking initiation (ever smoked regularly) at genome-wide significance. Data on the associations between the SNPs and 14 CVDs were obtained from the UK Biobank study (N = 367 643 individuals), CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (N = 184 305 individuals), Atrial Fibrillation Consortium (2017 dataset; N = 154 432 individuals), and Million Veteran Program (MVP; N = 190 266 individuals). The main analyses were conducted using the random-effects inverse-variance weighted method and complemented with multivariable MR analyses and the weighted median and MR-Egger approaches. Genetic predisposition to smoking initiation was most strongly and consistently associated with higher odds of coronary artery disease, heart failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attack, peripheral arterial disease, and arterial hypertension. Genetic predisposition to smoking initiation was additionally associated with higher odds of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in the UK Biobank but not with venous thromboembolism in the MVP. There was limited evidence of causal associations of smoking initiation with atrial fibrillation, aortic valve stenosis, thoracic aortic aneurysm, and intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage. This MR study supports a causal association between smoking and a broad range of CVDs, in particular, coronary artery disease, heart failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attack, peripheral arterial disease, and arterial hypertension.",European heart journal,2020,"Brain Ischemia; Cardiovascular Diseases; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Smoking; Stroke",False,3

Million Veteran Program,32915777,The relationship between circulating lipids and breast cancer risk: A Mendelian randomization study.,"A number of epidemiological and genetic studies have attempted to determine whether levels of circulating lipids are associated with risks of various cancers, including breast cancer (BC). However, it remains unclear whether a causal relationship exists between lipids and BC. If alteration of lipid levels also reduced risk of BC, this could present a target for disease prevention. This study aimed to assess a potential causal relationship between genetic variants associated with plasma lipid traits (high-density lipoprotein, HDL; low-density lipoprotein, LDL; triglycerides, TGs) with risk for BC using Mendelian randomization (MR). Data from genome-wide association studies in up to 215,551 participants from the Million Veteran Program (MVP) were used to construct genetic instruments for plasma lipid traits. The effect of these instruments on BC risk was evaluated using genetic data from the BCAC (Breast Cancer Association Consortium) based on 122,977 BC cases and 105,974 controls. Using MR, we observed that a 1-standard-deviation genetically determined increase in HDL levels is associated with an increased risk for all BCs (HDL: OR [odds ratio] = 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-1.13, P < 0.001). Multivariable MR analysis, which adjusted for the effects of LDL, TGs, body mass index (BMI), and age at menarche, corroborated this observation for HDL (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03-1.10, P = 4.9 × 10-4) and also found a relationship between LDL and BC risk (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01-1.07, P = 0.02). We did not observe a difference in these relationships when stratified by breast tumor estrogen receptor (ER) status. We repeated this analysis using genetic variants independent of the leading association at core HDL pathway genes and found that these variants were also associated with risk for BCs (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06-1.16, P = 1.5 × 10-6), including locus-specific associations at ABCA1 (ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily A Member 1), APOE-APOC1-APOC4-APOC2 (Apolipoproteins E, C1, C4, and C2), and CETP (Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein). In addition, we found evidence that genetic variation at the ABO locus is associated with both lipid levels and BC. Through multiple statistical approaches, we minimized and tested for the confounding effects of pleiotropy and population stratification on our analysis; however, the possible existence of residual pleiotropy and stratification remains a limitation of this study. We observed that genetically elevated plasma HDL and LDL levels appear to be associated with increased BC risk. Future studies are required to understand the mechanism underlying this putative causal relationship, with the goal of developing potential therapeutic strategies aimed at altering the cholesterol-mediated effect on BC risk.",PLoS medicine,2020,"Adult; Breast Neoplasms; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Lipids; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Triglycerides",False,3
Million Veteran Program,32970095,Novel Risk Loci in Tinnitus and Causal Inference With Neuropsychiatric Disorders Among Adults of European Ancestry.,"Tinnitus affects at least 16 million US adults, but its pathophysiology is complicated, and treatment options remain limited. A heritable component has been identified in family and twin studies; however, no large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been accomplished. To identify genetic risk loci associated with tinnitus, determine genetic correlations, and infer possible relationships of tinnitus with hearing loss and neuropsychiatric disorders and traits. A GWAS of self-reported tinnitus was performed in the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort using a linear mixed-model method implemented in BOLT-LMM (linear mixed model). Replication of significant findings was sought in the nonoverlapping US Million Veteran Program (MVP) cohort. A total of 172 995 UKB (discovery) and 260 832 MVP (replication) participants of European ancestry with self-report regarding tinnitus and hearing loss underwent genomic analysis. Linkage-disequilibrium score regression and mendelian randomization were performed between tinnitus and hearing loss and neuropsychiatric disorders. Data from the UKB were acquired and analyzed from September 24, 2018, to December 13, 2019. Data acquisition for the MVP cohort was completed July 22, 2019. Data analysis for both cohorts was completed on February 11, 2020. Estimates of single nucleotide variation (SNV)-based heritability for tinnitus, identification of genetic risk loci and genes, functional mapping, and replication were performed. Genetic association and inferred causality of tinnitus compared with hearing loss and neuropsychiatric disorders and traits were analyzed. Of 172 995 UKB participants (53.7% female; mean [SD], 58.0 [8.2] years), 155 395 unrelated participants underwent SNV-based heritability analyses across a range of tinnitus phenotype definitions that explained approximately 6% of the heritability. The GWAS based on the most heritable model in the full UKB cohort identified 6 genome-wide significant loci and 27 genes in gene-based analyses, with replication of 3 of 6 loci and 8 of 27 genes in 260 832 MVP cohort participants (92.8% men; mean [SD] age, 63.8 [13.2] years). Mendelian randomization indicated that major depressive disorder had a permissive effect (β = 0.133; P = .003) and years of education had a protective effect (β = -0.322, P = <.001) on tinnitus, whereas tinnitus and hearing loss inferred a bidirectional association (β = 0.072, P = .001 and β = 1.546, P = <.001, respectively). This large GWAS characterizes the genetic architecture of tinnitus, demonstrating modest but significant heritability and a polygenic profile with multiple significant risk loci and genes. Genetic correlation and inferred causation between tinnitus and major depressive disorder, educational level, and hearing impairment were identified, consistent with clinical and neuroimaging evidence. These findings may guide gene-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to this pervasive disorder.",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,2020,Adult; Aged; Europe; Female; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Psychotic Disorders; Tinnitus; United States,False,8
Million Veteran Program,33341409,Extracellular Volume in Primary Mitral Regurgitation.,"This study used cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to evaluate whether elevated extracellular volume (ECV) was associated with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) or if elevated ECV was a consequence of remodeling independent of primary mitral regurgitation (MR) etiology. Replacement fibrosis in primary MR is more prevalent in MVP; however, data on ECV as a surrogate for diffuse interstitial fibrosis in primary MR are limited. Patients with chronic primary MR underwent comprehensive CMR phenotyping and were stratified into an MVP cohort (>2 mm leaflet displacement on a 3-chamber cine CMR) and a non-MVP cohort. Factors associated with ECV and replacement fibrosis were assessed. The association of ECV and symptoms related to MR and clinical events (mitral surgery and cardiovascular death) was ascertained. A total of 424 patients with primary MR (229 with MVP and 195 non-MVP) were enrolled. Replacement fibrosis was more prevalent in the MVP cohort (34.1% vs. 6.7%; p < 0.001), with bi-leaflet MVP having the strongest association with replacement fibrosis (odds ratio: 10.5; p < 0.001). ECV increased with MR severity in a similar fashion for both MVP and non-MVP cohorts and was associated with MR severity but not MVP on multivariable analysis. Elevated ECV was independently associated with symptoms related to MR and clinical events. Although replacement fibrosis was more prevalent in MVP, diffuse interstitial fibrosis as inferred by ECV was associated with MR severity, regardless of primary MR etiology. ECV was independently associated with symptoms related to MR and clinical events. (DeBakey Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Study [DEBAKEY-CMR]; NCT04281823).",JACC.

Presently, blood samples have been collected from over 800,000 enrolled participants. The size and diversity of the MVP cohort, as well as the availability of extensive VA electronic health records, make it a promising resource for precision medicine. MVP is conducting array-based genotyping to provide a genome-wide scan of the entire cohort, in parallel with whole-genome sequencing, methylation, and other 'omics assays. Here, we present the design and performance of the MVP 1.0 custom Axiom array, which was designed and developed as a single assay to be used across the multi-ethnic MVP cohort. A unified genetic quality-control analysis was developed and conducted on an initial tranche of 485,856 individuals, leading to a high-quality dataset of 459,777 unique individuals. 668,418 genetic markers passed quality control and showed high-quality genotypes not only on common variants but also on rare variants. We confirmed that, with non-European individuals making up nearly 30%, MVP's substantial ancestral diversity surpasses that of other large biobanks. We also demonstrated the quality of the MVP dataset by replicating established genetic associations with height in European Americans and African Americans ancestries. This current dataset has been made available to approved MVP researchers for genome-wide association studies and other downstream analyses.

Million Veteran Program,31279615,Fried food consumption and risk of coronary artery disease: The Million Veteran Program.,"Previous studies of the relationship between fried food consumption and coronary artery disease (CAD) have yielded conflicting results. We tested the hypothesis that frequent fried food consumption is associated with a higher risk of incident CAD events in Million Veteran Program (MVP) participants. Veterans Health Administration electronic health record data were linked to questionnaires completed at MVP enrollment. Self-reported fried food consumption at baseline was categorized: (<1, 1-3, 4-6 times per week or daily). The outcome of interest was non-fatal myocardial infarction or CAD events. We fitted a Cox regression model adjusting for age, sex, race, education, exercise, smoking and alcohol consumption. Of 154,663 MVP enrollees with survey data, mean age was 64 years and 90% were men. During a mean follow-up of approximately 3 years, there were 6,725 CAD events. There was a positive linear relationship between frequency of fried food consumption and risk of CAD (p for trend 0.0015). Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) were 1.0 (ref), 1.07 (1.01-1.13), 1.08 (1.01-1.16), and 1.14 (1.03-1.27) across consecutive increasing categories of fried food intake.

We tested the primary hypothesis that egg consumption is positively associated with incidence of MI among veterans. In secondary analyses, we examined potential effect modification of egg-MI relation by adiposity and type 2 diabetes. We analyzed data collected on 188,267 US veterans who were enrolled in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) from 2011 to 2018. Information on egg consumption was obtained via self-administered food frequency questionnaire and we used electronic health records to identify incident MI. The mean age was 64.4 (SD = 12.0) years and 9.9% of the population were female. We ascertained 10,260 new cases of non-fatal MI during an average follow up of 3.24 years (range: 0.002 to 7.49 y). Hazard ratio (95% CI) for non-fatal MI were 1.00 (ref), 0.93 (0.85-0.1.02), 0.96 (0.87-1.05), 0.98 (0.89-1.07), 1.08 (0.98-1.19), 1.11 (1.00-1.24), and 1.13 (1.00-1.28) for egg consumption of <1/month, 1-3/month, 1/week, 2-4/week, 5-6/week, 1/d, and 2+/d, respectively, controlling for age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, exercise, alcohol intake, and overall dietary pattern (p non-linear trend 0.019).

MVP participants with alanine aminotransferases (ALT) >40 units/L for men and >30 units/L for women without other causes of liver disease were compared to controls with normal ALT. Genetic variants spanning eight NAFLD risk or ALT-associated loci (LYPLAL1, GCKR, HSD17B13, TRIB1, PPP1R3B, ERLIN1, TM6SF2, PNPLA3) were tested for NAFLD associations with sensitivity analyses adjusting for metabolic risk factors and alcohol consumption. A manual EHR review assessed performance characteristics of the NAFLD phenotype with imaging and biopsy data as gold standards. Genetic associations with advanced fibrosis were explored using FIB4, NAFLD Fibrosis Score and platelet counts. Among 322,259 MVP participants, 19% met non-invasive criteria for NAFLD. Trans-ethnic meta-analysis replicated associations with previously reported genetic variants in all but LYPLAL1 and GCKR loci (P<6x10-3), without attenuation when adjusted for metabolic risk factors and alcohol consumption. At the previously reported LYPLAL1 locus, the established genetic variant did not appear to be associated with NAFLD, however the regional association plot showed a significant association with NAFLD 279kb downstream.

Million Veteran Program,31872970,Genome-wide association study of cognitive performance in U.S. veterans with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.,"Cognitive impairment is a frequent and serious problem in patients with various forms of severe mental illnesses (SMI), including schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP). Recent research suggests genetic links to several cognitive phenotypes in both SMI and in the general population. Our goal in this study was to identify potential genomic signatures of cognitive functioning in veterans with severe mental illness and compare them to previous findings for cognition across different populations. Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) Study #572 evaluated cognitive and functional capacity measures among SZ and BP patients. In conjunction with the VA Million Veteran Program, 3,959 European American (1,095 SZ, 2,864 BP) and 2,601 African American (1,095 SZ, 2,864 BP) patients were genotyped using a custom Affymetrix Axiom Biobank array. We performed a genome-wide association study of global cognitive functioning, constructed polygenic scores for SZ and cognition in the general population, and examined genetic correlations with 2,626 UK Biobank traits. Although no single locus attained genome-wide significance, observed allelic effects were strongly consistent with previous studies. We observed robust associations between global cognitive functioning and polygenic scores for cognitive performance, intelligence, and SZ risk. We also identified significant genetic correlations with several cognition-related traits in UK Biobank. In a diverse cohort of U.S. veterans with SZ or BP, we demonstrate broad overlap of common genetic effects on cognition in the general population, and find that greater polygenic loading for SZ risk is associated with poorer cognitive performance.","American journal of medical genetics.

To date, however, no known study has examined whether social environmental factors such as attachment style may moderate the relation between PRS and PTSD. We evaluated main and interactive effects of PRS and attachment style on PTSD symptoms in a nationally representative sample of trauma-exposed European-American U.S. military veterans (N = 2030). PRS was derived from a genome-wide association study of PTSD re-experiencing symptoms (N = 146,660) in the Million Veteran Program cohort. Using one-sample Mendelian randomization with data from the UK Biobank (N = 115,099), we evaluated the effects of re-experiencing PRS and attachment style on PTSD symptoms. Higher re-experiencing PRS and secure attachment style were independently associated with PTSD symptoms. A significant PRS-by-attachment style interaction was also observed (β = -.11, p = .006), with a positive association between re-experiencing PRS and PTSD symptoms observed only among veterans with an insecure attachment style. One-sample Mendelian randomization analyses suggested that the association between PTSD symptoms and attachment style is bidirectional. PRS enrichment analyses revealed a significant interaction between attachment style and a variant mapping to the IGSF11 gene (rs151177743, p = 2.1 × 10 Attachment style may moderate polygenic risk for PTSD symptoms, and a novel locus implicated in synaptic transmission and plasticity may serve as a possible biological mediator of this association.

Million Veteran Program,32492095,Association of OPRM1 Functional Coding Variant With Opioid Use Disorder: A Genome-Wide Association Study.,"With the current opioid crisis, it is important to improve understanding of the biological mechanisms of opioid use disorder (OUD). To detect genetic risk variants for OUD and determine genetic correlations and causal association with OUD and other traits. A genome-wide association study of electronic health record-defined OUD in the Million Veteran Program sample was conducted, comprising 8529 affected European American individuals and 71 200 opioid-exposed European American controls (defined by electronic health record trajectory analysis) and 4032 affected African American individuals and 26 029 opioid-exposed African American controls. Participants were enrolled from January 10, 2011, to May 21, 2018, with electronic health record data for OUD diagnosis from October 1, 1999, to February 7, 2018. Million Veteran Program results and additional OUD case-control genome-wide association study results from the Yale-Penn and Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment samples were meta-analyzed (total numbers: European American individuals, 10 544 OUD cases and 72 163 opioid-exposed controls; African American individuals, 5212 cases and 26 876 controls). Data on Yale-Penn participants were collected from February 14, 1999, to April 1, 2017, and data on Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment participants were collected from 1990 to 2007. The key result was replicated in 2 independent cohorts: proxy-phenotype buprenorphine treatment in the UK Biobank and newly genotyped Yale-Penn participants. Genetic correlations between OUD and other traits were tested, and mendelian randomization analysis was conducted to identify potential causal associations. Main outcomes were International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision-diagnosed OUD or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision-diagnosed OUD (Million Veteran Program), and DSM-IV-defined opioid dependence (Yale-Penn and Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment). A total of 114 759 individuals (101 016 men [88%]; mean [SD] age, 60.1 [12.8] years) were included. In 82 707 European American individuals, a functional coding variant (rs1799971, encoding Asn40Asp) in OPRM1 (μ-opioid receptor gene, the main biological target for opioid drugs; OMIM 600018) reached genome-wide significance (G allele: β = -0.066 [SE = 0.012]; P = 1.51 × 10-8). The finding was replicated in 2 independent samples. Single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability of OUD was 11.3% (SE = 1.8%). Opioid use disorder was genetically correlated with 83 traits, including multiple substance use traits, psychiatric illnesses, cognitive performance, and others. Mendelian randomization analysis revealed the following associations with OUD: risk of tobacco smoking, depression, neuroticism, worry neuroticism subcluster, and cognitive performance. No genome-wide significant association was detected for African American individuals or in transpopulation meta-analysis. This genome-wide meta-analysis identified a significant association of OUD with an OPRM1 variant, which was replicated in 2 independent samples.

We investigated whether omega-3 fatty acid supplement use and fish intake were associated with incident non-fatal CAD and ischemic stroke among US Veterans. The Million Veteran Program (MVP) is an ongoing nation-wide longitudinal cohort study of US Veterans with self-reported survey, biospecimen, and electronic health record data. Regular use of omega-3 supplements (yes/no) and frequency of fish intake within the past year were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations of omega-3 supplement use and fish intake with incident non-fatal CAD and ischemic stroke, defined from electronic health records using validated algorithms. Multivariable models included demographics, body mass index, education, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise frequency. Among 197,761 participants with food frequency data (mean age: 66 ± 12 years, 92% men), 21% regularly took omega-3 supplements and median fish intake was 1 (3-5 ounce) serving/week. Over a median follow-up of 2.9 years for non-fatal CAD and 3.3 years for non-fatal ischemic stroke, we observed 6265 and 4042 incident cases of non-fatal CAD and non-fatal ischemic stroke, respectively. Omega-3 fatty acid supplement use was independently associated with a lower risk of non-fatal ischemic stroke [HR (95% CI): 0.88 (0.81, 0.95)] but not non-fatal CAD [0.99 (0.93, 1.06)]. Fish intake was not independently associated with non-fatal CAD [1.01 (0.94, 1.09) for 1-3 servings/month, 1.03 (0.98, 1.11) for 1 serving/week, 1.02 (0.93, 1.11) for 2-4 servings/week, and 1.15 (0.98, 1.35) for ≥5 servings/week, reference = <1 serving/month, linear p-trend = 0.09] or non-fatal ischemic stroke [0.92 (0.84, 1.00) for 1-3 servings/month, 0.93 (0.85, 1.02) for 1 serving/week, 0.96 (0.86, 1.07) for 2-4 servings/week, and 1.13 (0.93-1.38) for ≥5 servings/week, linear p-trend = 0.16]. Neither omega-3 supplement use, nor fish intake, was associated with non-fatal CAD among US Veterans. While omega-3 supplement use was associated with lower risk of non-fatal ischemic stroke, fish intake was not. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm whether omega-3 supplementation is protective against ischemic stroke in a US population.","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2020,"Aged; Cohort Studies; Coronary Artery Disease; Diet; Dietary Supplements; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Female; Humans; Ischemic Stroke; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Seafood; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; Veterans",False,8

Recent genetic data support a role for a procoagulation protein variant, the factor V Leiden mutation, in PAD. The role of other hemostatic factors in PAD remains unknown. We evaluated the role of hemostatic factors in PAD using Mendelian randomization. Approach and Results: Two-sample Mendelian randomization to evaluate the roles of FVII (factor VII), FVIII (factor VIII), FXI (factor XI), VWF (von Willebrand factor), and fibrinogen in PAD was performed using summary statistics from GWAS for hemostatic factors performed within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in the Genome Epidemiology Consortium and from GWAS performed for PAD within the Million Veteran Program.

Million Veteran Program,32833022,Genetic determinants of increased body mass index mediate the effect of smoking on increased risk for type 2 diabetes but not coronary artery disease.,"Clinical observations have linked tobacco smoking with increased type 2 diabetes risk. Mendelian randomization analysis has recently suggested smoking may be a causal risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, this association could be mediated by additional risk factors correlated with smoking behavior, which have not been investigated. We hypothesized that body mass index (BMI) could help to explain the association between smoking and diabetes risk. First, we confirmed that genetic determinants of smoking initiation increased risk for type 2 diabetes (OR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.15-1.27, P = 1 × 10-12) and coronary artery disease (CAD; OR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.16-1.26, P = 2 × 10-20). Additionally, 2-fold increased smoking risk was positively associated with increased BMI (~0.8 kg/m2, 95% CI: 0.54-0.98 kg/m2, P = 1.8 × 10-11). Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses showed that BMI accounted for nearly all the risk smoking exerted on type 2 diabetes (OR 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.11, P = 0.03). In contrast, the independent effect of smoking on increased CAD risk persisted (OR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.08-1.17, P = 3 × 10-8). Causal mediation analyses agreed with these estimates. Furthermore, analysis using individual-level data from the Million Veteran Program independently replicated the association of smoking behavior with CAD (OR 1.24, 95% CI: 1.12-1.37, P = 2 × 10-5), but not type 2 diabetes (OR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.89-1.08, P = 0.69), after controlling for BMI. Our findings support a model whereby genetic determinants of smoking increase type 2 diabetes risk indirectly through their relationship with obesity.

The impact on other diseases remains less well characterized. We created a genetic risk score (GRS) for PCSK9 using four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at or near the PCSK9 locus known to impact lower LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C): rs11583680, rs11591147, rs2479409, and rs11206510. We then used our GRS to calculate weighted odds ratios reflecting the impact of a genetically determined 10 mg/dL decrease in LDL-C on several pre-specified phenotypes including CAD, IS, peripheral artery disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), type 2 diabetes, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer. Finally, we used our weighted GRS to perform a phenome-wide association study. Genetic and electronic health record data that passed quality control was available in 312,097 individuals, (227,490 White participants, 58,907 Black participants, and 25,700 Hispanic participants). PCSK9 mediated reduction in LDL-C was associated with a reduced risk of CAD and AAA in trans-ethnic meta-analysis (CAD OR 0.83 [95% CI 0.80-0.87], p = 6.0 x 10-21; AAA OR 0.76 [95% CI 0.68-0.86], p = 2.9 x 10-06).

SA showed strong genetic correlation with psychiatric disorders, particularly major depression, and also with smoking, pain, risk-taking behavior, sleep disturbances, lower educational attainment, reproductive traits, lower socioeconomic status, and poorer general health. After conditioning on psychiatric disorders, the genetic correlations between SA and psychiatric disorders decreased, whereas those with nonpsychiatric traits remained largely unchanged.

Million Veteran Program,34822319,Development and Evaluation of a Rules-based Algorithm for Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma in the VA Million Veteran Program.,"The availability of electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobank data for research presents opportunities to better understand complex ocular diseases. Developing accurate computable phenotypes for ocular diseases for which gold standard diagnosis includes imaging remains inaccessible in most biobank-linked EHRs. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a computable phenotype to identify primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) through accessing the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and Million Veteran Program (MVP) biobank. Accessing CPRS clinical ophthalmology data from VA Medical Center Eye Clinic (VAMCEC) patients, we developed and iteratively refined POAG case and control algorithms based on clinical, prescription, and structured diagnosis data (ICD-CM codes). Refinement was performed via detailed chart review, initially at a single VAMCEC (n = 200) and validated at two additional VAMCECs (n = 100 each). Positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were computed as the proportion of CPRS patients correctly classified with POAG or without POAG, respectively, by the algorithms, validated by ophthalmologists and optometrists with access to gold-standard clinical diagnosis data. The final algorithms performed better than previously reported approaches in assuring the accuracy and reproducibility of POAG classification (PPV >83% and NPV >97%) with consistent performance in Black or African American and in White Veterans. Applied to the MVP to identify cases and controls, genetic analysis of a known POAG-associated locus further validated the algorithms. We conclude that ours is a viable approach to use combined EHR-genetic data to study patients with complex diseases that require imaging confirmation.",Ophthalmic epidemiology,2022,"Humans; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Veterans; Reproducibility of Results; Algorithms; Electronic Health Records",False,7
Million Veteran Program,33341409,Extracellular Volume in Primary Mitral Regurgitation.,"This study used cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to evaluate whether elevated extracellular volume (ECV) was associated with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) or if elevated ECV was a consequence of remodeling independent of primary mitral regurgitation (MR) etiology. Replacement fibrosis in primary MR is more prevalent in MVP; however, data on ECV as a surrogate for diffuse interstitial fibrosis in primary MR are limited. Patients with chronic primary MR underwent comprehensive CMR phenotyping and were stratified into an MVP cohort (>2 mm leaflet displacement on a 3-chamber cine CMR) and a non-MVP cohort. Factors associated with ECV and replacement fibrosis were assessed. The association of ECV and symptoms related to MR and clinical events (mitral surgery and cardiovascular death) was ascertained. A total of 424 patients with primary MR (229 with MVP and 195 non-MVP) were enrolled. Replacement fibrosis was more prevalent in the MVP cohort (34.1% vs. 6.7%; p < 0.001), with bi-leaflet MVP having the strongest association with replacement fibrosis (odds ratio: 10.5; p < 0.001). ECV increased with MR severity in a similar fashion for both MVP and non-MVP cohorts and was associated with MR severity but not MVP on multivariable analysis. Elevated ECV was independently associated with symptoms related to MR and clinical events. Although replacement fibrosis was more prevalent in MVP, diffuse interstitial fibrosis as inferred by ECV was associated with MR severity, regardless of primary MR etiology. ECV was independently associated with symptoms related to MR and clinical events. (DeBakey Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Study [DEBAKEY-CMR]; NCT04281823).",JACC.

Million Veteran Program,34483344,Chocolate consumption and risk of coronary artery disease: the Million Veteran Program.,"Although previous studies have suggested cocoa products may promote cardiovascular health in the general population, no public data are available from patients receiving care in a national integrated health care system. We tested the hypothesis that regular chocolate consumption is associated with a lower risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) events among participants of the Million Veteran Program (MVP). Secondary analysis examined if the main hypothesis was observed among participants with type 2 diabetes. We analyzed data from MVP participants who completed the food frequency section of the MVP Lifestyle Survey and were free of CAD at the time of survey completion. CAD events during follow-up (International Statistical Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision codes 410-411 and 413-414, and Tenth Revision codes I20-I25 except I25.2) were assessed using electronic health records. We fitted a Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the RR of CAD. Of 188,447 MVP enrollees with survey data, mean ± SD age was 64 ± 12.0 y and 90% were men. For regular chocolate (28.3 g/serving) consumption of <1 serving/mo, 1-3 servings/mo, 1 serving/wk, 2-4 servings/wk, and ≥5 servings/wk, crude incidence rates (per 1000 person-years) for fatal and nonfatal CAD events or coronary procedures were 20.2, 17.5, 16.7, 17.1, and 16.9, respectively, during a mean follow-up of 3.2 y. After adjusting for age, sex, race, and lifestyle factors, the corresponding HRs (95% CIs) were 1.00 (ref), 0.92 (0.87, 0.96), 0.88 (0.83, 0.93), 0.89 (0.84, 0.95), and 0.89 (0.84, 0.96), respectively ( Regular chocolate consumption was associated with a lower risk of CAD among veterans, but was not associated with cardiovascular disease risk in veterans with type 2 diabetes.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,2021,"Aged; Chocolate; Coronary Artery Disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; United States; Veterans",False,8
Million Veteran Program,34381935,Polygenic Breast Cancer Risk for Women Veterans in the Million Veteran Program.,"Accurate breast cancer (BC) risk assessment allows personalized screening and prevention. Prospective validation of prediction models is required before clinical application. Here, we evaluate clinical- and genetic-based BC prediction models in a prospective cohort of women from the Million Veteran Program. Clinical BC risk prediction models were validated in combination with a genetic polygenic risk score of 313 (PRS313) single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genetic females without prior BC diagnosis (n = 35,130, mean age 49 years) with 30% non-Hispanic African ancestry (AA). Clinical risk models tested were Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium, literature review, and Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, and implemented with or without PRS313. Prediction accuracy and association with incident breast cancer was evaluated with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), hazard ratios, and proportion with high absolute lifetime risk. Three hundred thirty-eight participants developed incident breast cancers with a median follow-up of 3.9 years (2.5 cases/1,000 person-years), with 196 incident cases in women of European ancestry and 112 incident cases in AA women. Individualized Coherent Absolute Risk Estimator-literature review in combination with PRS313 had an AUC of 0.708 (95% CI, 0.659 to 0.758) in women with European or non-African ancestries and 0.625 (0.539 to 0.711) in AA women. Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool with PRS313 had an AUC of 0.695 (0.62 to 0.729) in European or non-AA and 0.675 (0.626 to 0.723) in AA women. Incorporation of PRS313 with clinical models improved prediction in European but not in AA women. Models estimated up to 9% of European and 18% of AA women with absolute lifetime risk > 20%.

We aim to identify risk factors specific to each state of COVID-19 progression from SARS-CoV-2 infection through death. We included 648,202 participants from the Veteran Affairs Million Veteran Program (2011-). We identified characteristics and 1,809 ICD code-based phenotypes from the electronic health record. We used logistic regression to examine the association of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), race, and prevalent phenotypes to the stages of COVID-19 disease progression: infection, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 30-day mortality (separate models for each). Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, number of visit months and ICD codes, state infection rate and controlled for multiple testing using false discovery rate (≤0.1). As of August 10, 2020, 5,929 individuals were SARS-CoV-2 positive and among those, 1,463 (25%) were hospitalized, 579 (10%) were in ICU, and 398 (7%) died. We observed a lower risk in women vs. men for ICU and mortality (Odds Ratio (95% CI): 0.48 (0.30-0.76) and 0.59 (0.31-1.15), respectively) and a higher risk in Black vs. Other race patients for hospitalization and ICU (OR (95%CI): 1.53 (1.32-1.77) and 1.63 (1.32-2.02), respectively). We observed an increased risk of all COVID-19 disease states with older age and BMI ≥35 vs. 20-24 kg/m2. Renal failure, respiratory failure, morbid obesity, acid-base balance disorder, white blood cell diseases, hydronephrosis and bacterial infections were associated with an increased risk of ICU admissions; sepsis, chronic skin ulcers, acid-base balance disorder and acidosis were associated with mortality.

The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and linear mixed models were used to compare age-standardized frequencies and means across race/ethnicity groups, stratified by gender. Black, Hispanic, and Other race men and women reported worse self-rated health, greater VA healthcare utilization, and more combat exposure than Whites. Compared to White men, Black and Other men reported more circulatory, musculoskeletal, mental health, and infectious disease conditions while Hispanic men reported fewer circulatory and more mental health, infectious disease, kidney, and neurological conditions. Compared to White women, Black women reported more circulatory and infectious disease conditions and Other women reported more infectious disease conditions. Smoking rates were higher among Black men, but lower for other minority groups compared to Whites. Minority groups were less likely to drink alcohol and had lower physical fitness than Whites.

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that nut consumption is inversely associated with risk of incidence of stroke, CAD, and CVD mortality in the prospective Million Veterans Program (MVP). A total of 179,827 MVP participants enrolled between 2011 and 2018 were free of CVD prior to assessment of nut consumption via the food frequency questionnaire. Incident stroke and CVD events were ascertained from the Veterans Affairs electronic medical health records and the National Death Index. We used the Cox regression model to compute multivariable adjusted hazard ratios. Over the 3.5-year median follow-up, 3362 new cases of ischemic stroke were identified. When compared with participants who rarely or never consumed nuts, those consuming nuts ≥ 5 times per week were 19% less likely to experience a stroke (95% CI: 8% to 28%); 22% less likely to suffer from CAD (95% CI: 16% to 28%); and 24% less likely to die from CVD (95% CI: 7% to 37%).

Million Veteran Program,33745578,Consumption of potatoes and incidence rate of coronary artery disease: The Million Veteran Program.,"Potato consumption is highly prevalent around the world. Previous studies have reported a positive association of potato intake with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. However, data are scarce on potato consumption and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). We hypothesized that potato consumption is positively associated with the incidence of CAD among US veterans. We prospectively studied 148,671 participants from Million Veteran Program (MVP). We used a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire to assess consumption of baked, boiled, and mashed potatoes. The incidence of CAD was assessed through electronic health record. We used Cox Proportional hazard model to compute hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for CAD events across categories of potato intake. The average age of participants was 64 years at the time of potato assessment. A total of 6309 new cases of CAD occurred during a mean follow up of 2.7 ± 1.4 y. Median potato consumption was 1 cup/week. The crude incidence of CAD from lowest to highest category of potato consumption was 14.5, 15.0, 15.2, 16.1, and 18.9 per 1000 person-years, respectively. Hazard ratios (95% CI) of CAD were 1.00 (reference), 1.02 (0.93-1.11), 1.02 (0.93-1.12), 1.04 (0.95-1.15), and 1.21 (1.07-1.37) for potato intake of <1 cup/month, 1-3 cups/month, 1 cup/week, 2-4 cups/week, and 5+ cups/week respectively, adjusting for age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, exercise, smoking, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) score, and education. The observed relation of potato consumption with CAD was not modified by age, BMI, gender, and ethnicity in a secondary analysis.

Million Veteran Program,34078102,Metabolic Traits and Stroke Risk in Individuals of African Ancestry: Mendelian Randomization Analysis.,"Metabolic traits affect ischemic stroke (IS) risk, but the degree to which this varies across different ethnic ancestries is not known. Our aim was to apply Mendelian randomization to investigate the causal effects of type 2 diabetes (T2D) liability and lipid traits on IS risk in African ancestry individuals, and to compare them to estimates obtained in European ancestry individuals. For African ancestry individuals, genetic proxies for T2D liability and circulating lipids were obtained from a meta-analysis of the African Partnership for Chronic Disease Research study, the UK Biobank, and the Million Veteran Program (total N=77 061). Genetic association estimates for IS risk were obtained from the Consortium of Minority Population Genome-Wide Association Studies of Stroke (3734 cases and 18 317 controls). For European ancestry individuals, genetic proxies for the same metabolic traits were obtained from Million Veteran Program (lipids N=297 626, T2D N=148 726 cases, and 965 732 controls), and genetic association estimates for IS risk were obtained from the MEGASTROKE study (34 217 cases and 406 111 controls). Random-effects inverse-variance weighted Mendelian randomization was used as the main method, complemented with sensitivity analyses more robust to pleiotropy. Higher genetically proxied T2D liability, LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), total cholesterol and lower genetically proxied HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) were associated with increased risk of IS in African ancestry individuals (odds ratio per doubling the odds of T2D liability [95% CI], 1.09 [1.07-1.11]; per standard-deviation increase in LDL-C, 1.12 [1.04-1.21]; total cholesterol: 1.23 [1.06-1.43]; HDL-C, 0.93 [0.89-0.99]).

Million Veteran Program,33534346,Associations of biogeographic ancestry with hypertension traits.,"Ethnic disparities in hypertension prevalence are well documented, though the influence of genetic ancestry is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate associations of geographic genetic ancestry with hypertension and underlying blood pressure traits. We tested genetically inferred ancestry proportions from five 1000 Genomes reference populations (GBR, PEL, YRI, CHB, and LWK) for association with four continuous blood pressure (BP) traits (SBP, DBP, PP, MAP) and the dichotomous outcomes hypertension and apparent treatment-resistant hypertension in 220 495 European American, 59 927 African American, and 21 273 Hispanic American individuals from the Million Veteran Program. Ethnicity stratified results were meta-analyzed to report effect estimates per 10% difference for a given ancestry proportion in all samples. Percentage GBR was negatively associated with BP (P = 2.13 × 10-19, 7.92 × 10-8, 4.41 × 10-11, and 3.57 × 10-13 for SBP, DBP, PP, and MAP, respectively; coefficient range -0.10 to -0.21 mmHg per 10% increase in ancestry proportion) and was protective against hypertension [P = 2.59 × 10-5, odds ratio (OR) = 0.98] relative to other ancestries. YRI percentage was positively associated with BP (P = 1.63 × 10-23, 1.94 × 10-26, 0.012, and 3.26 × 10-29 for SBP, DBP, PP, and MAP, respectively; coefficient range 0.06-0.32 mmHg per 10% increase in ancestry proportion) and was positively associated with hypertension risk (P = 3.10 × 10-11, OR = 1.04) and apparent treatment-resistant hypertension risk (P = 1.86 × 10-4, OR = 1.04) compared with other ancestries. Percentage PEL was inversely associated with DBP (P = 2.84 × 10-5, beta = -0.11 mmHg per 10% increase in ancestry proportion). These results demonstrate that risk for BP traits varies significantly by genetic ancestry.

Million Veteran Program,33169155,Genome-Wide Association Studies of Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder in a Diverse Cohort of US Veterans.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BIP) are debilitating neuropsychiatric disorders, collectively affecting 2% of the world's population. Recognizing the major impact of these psychiatric disorders on the psychosocial function of more than 200 000 US Veterans, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently completed genotyping of more than 8000 veterans with SCZ and BIP in the Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) #572. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in CSP #572 and benchmarked the predictive value of polygenic risk scores (PRS) constructed from published findings. We combined our results with available summary statistics from several recent GWAS, realizing the largest and most diverse studies of these disorders to date. Our primary GWAS uncovered new associations between CHD7 variants and SCZ, and novel BIP associations with variants in Sortilin Related VPS10 Domain Containing Receptor 3 (SORCS3) and downstream of PCDH11X. Combining our results with published summary statistics for SCZ yielded 39 novel susceptibility loci including CRHR1, and we identified 10 additional findings for BIP (28 326 cases and 90 570 controls). PRS trained on published GWAS were significantly associated with case-control status among European American (P < 10-30) and African American (P < .0005) participants in CSP #572. We have demonstrated that published findings for SCZ and BIP are robustly generalizable to a diverse cohort of US veterans.

Million Veteran Program,34318347,Hearing loss and tinnitus: association studies for complex-hearing disorders in mouse and man.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide an unbiased first look at genetic loci involved in aging and noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus. The hearing phenotype, whether audiogram-based or self-report, is regressed against genotyped information at representative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. Findings include the fact that both hearing loss and tinnitus are polygenic disorders, with up to thousands of genes, each of effect size of < 0.02. Smaller human GWAS' were able to use objective measures and identified a few loci; however, hundreds of thousands of participants have been required for the statistical power to identify significant variants, and GWAS is unable to assess rare variants with mean allele frequency < 1%. Animal studies are required as well because of inability to access the human cochlea. Mouse GWAS builds on linkage techniques and the known phenotypic differences in auditory function between inbred strains. With the advantage that the laboratory environment can be controlled for noise and aging, the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HDMP) combines 100 strains sequenced at high resolution. Lift-over regions between mice and humans have identified over 17,000 homologous genes. Since most significant SNPs are either intergenic or in introns, and binding sites between species are poorly preserved between species, expression quantitative trait locus information is required to bring humans and mice into agreement.

To determine the association between genetic liability to smoking and risk of CAD, PAD, and large-artery stroke. Mendelian randomization study using summary statistics from genome-wide associations of smoking (UK Biobank; up to 462 690 individuals), CAD (Coronary Artery Disease Genome Wide Replication and Meta-analysis plus the Coronary Artery Disease Genetics Consortium; up to 60 801 cases, 123 504 controls), PAD (VA Million Veteran Program; up to 24 009 cases, 150 983 controls), and large-artery stroke (MEGASTROKE; up to 4373 cases, 406 111 controls). This study was conducted using summary statistic data from large, previously described cohorts. Review of those publications does not reveal the total recruitment dates for those cohorts. Data analyses were conducted from August 2019 to June 2020. Genetic liability to smoking (as proxied by genetic variants associated with lifetime smoking index). Risk (odds ratios [ORs]) of CAD, PAD, and large-artery stroke. Genetic liability to smoking was associated with increased risk of PAD (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.78-2.56; P = 3.6 × 10-16), CAD (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.25-1.75; P = 4.4 × 10-6), and stroke (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02-1.92; P = .04). Genetic liability to smoking was associated with greater risk of PAD than risk of large-artery stroke (ratio of ORs, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.05-2.19; P = .02) or CAD (ratio of ORs, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.12-1.84; P = .004). The association between genetic liability to smoking and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases remained independent from the effects of smoking on traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In this mendelian randomization analysis of data from large studies of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, genetic liability to smoking was a strong risk factor for CAD, PAD, and stroke, although the estimated association was strongest between smoking and PAD.

To date, however, no known study has examined whether social environmental factors such as attachment style may moderate the relation between PRS and PTSD. We evaluated main and interactive effects of PRS and attachment style on PTSD symptoms in a nationally representative sample of trauma-exposed European-American U.S. military veterans (N = 2030). PRS was derived from a genome-wide association study of PTSD re-experiencing symptoms (N = 146,660) in the Million Veteran Program cohort. Using one-sample Mendelian randomization with data from the UK Biobank (N = 115,099), we evaluated the effects of re-experiencing PRS and attachment style on PTSD symptoms. Higher re-experiencing PRS and secure attachment style were independently associated with PTSD symptoms. A significant PRS-by-attachment style interaction was also observed (β = -.11, p = .006), with a positive association between re-experiencing PRS and PTSD symptoms observed only among veterans with an insecure attachment style. One-sample Mendelian randomization analyses suggested that the association between PTSD symptoms and attachment style is bidirectional. PRS enrichment analyses revealed a significant interaction between attachment style and a variant mapping to the IGSF11 gene (rs151177743, p = 2.1 × 10 Attachment style may moderate polygenic risk for PTSD symptoms, and a novel locus implicated in synaptic transmission and plasticity may serve as a possible biological mediator of this association.

Research has proposed mechanisms whereby yogurt may improve circulating lipid concentrations. However, at the population level, the association of yogurt, as distinct from other dairy foods, with these important risk factors is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine whether the circulating lipid profile associated with yogurt is different to the circulating lipid profile that is associated with non-yogurt dairy products, specifically milk and cheese. The current study included the 192,564 US Veterans enrolled in the Million Veteran Program who reported frequency of yogurt consumption (assessed via food frequency questionnaire) and had lipid concentrations assessed. Trends were evaluated with linear regression. Mean age was 65 (SD = 11) years [20, 100 years]. A one serve/day higher yogurt consumption was positively associated (coefficient ± SE) with the concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) in individuals who were not (0.26 ± 0.12 mg/dL, P value = 0.025), and who were (0.25 ± 0.09, P value = 0.004), using antilipemic agents. Furthermore, higher yogurt consumption was inversely associated with the concentration of triglycerides, but only in individuals who were not using antilipemic agents (-1.46 ± 0.58, P value = 0.012). These apparent beneficial associations of yogurt with HDLC and triglycerides were independent of consumption of non-yogurt dairy foods and were not observed for consumption of either milk or cheese. In this prospective cohort study of U.S. Veterans, we found a beneficial relationship between higher frequency of yogurt consumption with circulating HDLC and triglyceride concentrations that was distinct from non-yogurt dairy foods.",Clinical nutrition ESPEN,2021,Aged; Animals; Humans; Lipids; Milk; Prospective Studies; Veterans; Yogurt,False,2

To date, however, no known study has used a prospective design to examine how polygenic risk scores (PRSs) interact with social-environmental factors such as attachment style to predict PTSD development. PRSs were derived from a genome-wide association study of PTSD symptoms (N = 186,689; Million Veteran Program cohort). We evaluated combined effects of PRS and attachment style in predicting incident PTSD in a 7-year, nationally representative cohort of trauma-exposed, European-American U.S. military veterans without PTSD (N = 1083). We also conducted multivariate gene-by-environment interaction and drug repositioning analyses to identify loci that interact with multiple environmental factors and potential pharmacotherapies that may be repurposed for this disorder. Veterans with higher PTSD PRS were more likely to have an incident-positive screen for PTSD over 7 years. A gene-by-environment interaction was also observed, such that higher PRS only predicted incident PTSD in veterans with an insecure attachment style and not those with a secure attachment style. At an individual locus level, the strongest gene-by-environment interaction was observed for the rs4702 variant of the FURIN gene with cumulative lifetime trauma burden. Drug repositioning revealed that genes implicated in PRS are perturbated by the drug doxylamine. Attachment style moderates polygenic risk for the development of PTSD in European-American veterans. These findings may inform PTSD prevention and treatment for veterans with high polygenic risk for PTSD and suggest a potential pharmacotherapeutic target for risk genes moderated by social-environmental factors.",Biological psychiatry,2022,"Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Military Personnel; Multifactorial Inheritance; Prospective Studies; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Veterans",False,6

Million Veteran Program,34265237,Regulatory variants in TCF7L2 are associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm.,"Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is characterized by dilation of the aortic root or ascending/descending aorta. TAA is a heritable disease that can be potentially life threatening. While 10%-20% of TAA cases are caused by rare, pathogenic variants in single genes, the origin of the majority of TAA cases remains unknown. A previous study implicated common variants in FBN1 with TAA disease risk. Here, we report a genome-wide scan of 1,351 TAA-affected individuals and 18,295 control individuals from the Cardiovascular Health Improvement Project and Michigan Genomics Initiative at the University of Michigan. We identified a genome-wide significant association with TAA for variants within the third intron of TCF7L2 following replication with meta-analysis of four additional independent cohorts. Common variants in this locus are the strongest known genetic risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Although evidence indicates the presence of different causal variants for TAA and type 2 diabetes at this locus, we observed an opposite direction of effect. The genetic association for TAA colocalizes with an aortic eQTL of TCF7L2, suggesting a functional relationship. These analyses predict an association of higher expression of TCF7L2 with TAA disease risk.

However, it is unknown whether the same etiologic influences that underlie PTSD co-occurring with AUD are those that underlie PTSD and AC individually. This study used large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to test whether PTSD and drinks per week [DPW]/AUD are causally related to one another, and, if so, whether PTSD precedes DPW/AUD and/or vice versa. We used Mendelian Randomization methods to analyze European ancestry GWAS summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC; PTSD), GWAS & Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine Use (GSCAN; DPW), and the Million Veteran Program (MVP; AUD). PTSD exerted a potentially causal effect on AUD (β = 0.039, SE = 0.014, p = 0.005), but not on DPW (β = 0.002, SE = 0.003, p = 0.414).

These findings extend latent analysis and molecular findings of shared and correlated risk between PTSD and alcohol phenotypes. Given the health behaviors associated with these phenotypes, these findings are important in that they suggest groups to prioritize for prevention efforts. Further, they provide a rationale for future preclinical and clinical studies examining the biological mechanisms by which PTSD may impact AUD.","Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",2021,"Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Case-Control Studies; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; White People",False,6

We aimed to identify genomic loci jointly associated with SCZ, BD, AUD and AC to gain further insights into their shared genetic architecture. We analysed summary data (P values and Z scores) from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using conjunctional false discovery rate (conjFDR) analysis, which increases power to discover shared genomic loci. We functionally characterized the identified loci using publicly available biological resources. AUD and AC data provided by the Million Veteran Program, derived from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. SCZ and BD data provided by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, based on cohorts from countries in Europe, North America and Australia. AUD (34 658 cases, 167 346 controls), AC (n = 200 680), SCZ (31 013 cases and 38 918 controls), BD (20 352 cases and 31 358 controls). All participants were of European ancestry. Genomic loci shared between alcohol traits, SCZ and BD at conjFDR <0.05. Conditional Q-Q plots showed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) enrichment for both alcohol traits across different levels of significance with SCZ and BD, and vice versa. Using conjFDR analysis we leveraged this genetic enrichment and identified several loci shared between SCZ and AUD (n = 28) and AC (n = 24), BD and AUD (n = 2) and AC (n = 8) at conjFDR <0.05. Among these loci, 24 are novel for AUD, 15 are novel for AC, three are novel for SCZ and one is novel for BD. There was a mixture of same and opposite effect directions among the shared loci. Alcohol use disorder and alcohol consumption share genomic loci with the psychiatric disorders schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with a mixed pattern of effect directions, indicating a complex genetic relationship between the phenotypes.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",2022,"Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Bipolar Disorder; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Schizophrenia",False,1
Million Veteran Program,34865855,Enhancing Discovery of Genetic Variants for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Through Integration of Quantitative Phenotypes and Trauma Exposure Information.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is heritable and a potential consequence of exposure to traumatic stress. Evidence suggests that a quantitative approach to PTSD phenotype measurement and incorporation of lifetime trauma exposure (LTE) information could enhance the discovery power of PTSD genome-wide association studies (GWASs). A GWAS on PTSD symptoms was performed in 51 cohorts followed by a fixed-effects meta-analysis (N = 182,199 European ancestry participants). A GWAS of LTE burden was performed in the UK Biobank cohort (N = 132,988). Genetic correlations were evaluated with linkage disequilibrium score regression. Multivariate analysis was performed using Multi-Trait Analysis of GWAS. Functional mapping and annotation of leading loci was performed with FUMA. Replication was evaluated using the Million Veteran Program GWAS of PTSD total symptoms. GWASs of PTSD symptoms and LTE burden identified 5 and 6 independent genome-wide significant loci, respectively. There was a 72% genetic correlation between PTSD and LTE. PTSD and LTE showed largely similar patterns of genetic correlation with other traits, albeit with some distinctions. Adjusting PTSD for LTE reduced PTSD heritability by 31%. Multivariate analysis of PTSD and LTE increased the effective sample size of the PTSD GWAS by 20% and identified 4 additional loci. Four of these 9 PTSD loci were independently replicated in the Million Veteran Program. Through using a quantitative trait measure of PTSD, we identified novel risk loci not previously identified using prior case-control analyses.

Less is known about the utility of PRS as a means to quantify genetic risk for substance use disorders (SUDs) than for many other traits. Nonetheless, the growth of large, electronic health record-based biobanks makes it possible to evaluate the association of SUD PRS with other traits. We calculated PRS for smoking initiation, alcohol use disorder (AUD), and opioid use disorder (OUD) using summary statistics from the Million Veteran Program sample. We then tested the association of each PRS with its primary phenotype in the Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB) using all available genotyped participants of African or European ancestry (AFR and EUR, respectively) (N = 18,612). Finally, we conducted phenome-wide association analyses (PheWAS) separately by ancestry and sex to test for associations across disease categories. Tobacco use disorder was the most common SUD in the PMBB, followed by AUD and OUD, consistent with the population prevalence of these disorders. All PRS were associated with their primary phenotype in both ancestry groups. PheWAS results yielded cross-trait associations across multiple domains, including psychiatric disorders and medical conditions. SUD PRS were associated with their primary phenotypes; however, they are not yet predictive enough to be useful diagnostically. The cross-trait associations of the SUD PRS are indicative of a broader genetic liability.

The most widely used approach in quality assessment (QA) for continuous variables is to detect the implausible numbers using prespecified thresholds. In augmentation to the thresholding method, we developed a score-based method that leverages the longitudinal characteristics of EHR data for detection of the observations inconsistent with the history of a patient. The method was applied to the height and weight data in the EHR from the Million Veteran Program Data from the Veteran's Healthcare Administration (VHA). A validation study was also conducted. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) metrics of the developed method outperforms the widely used thresholding method. It is also demonstrated that different quality assessment methods have a non-ignorable impact on the body mass index (BMI) classification calculated from height and weight data in the VHA's database.

Million Veteran Program,33541420,Multi-trait association studies discover pleiotropic loci between Alzheimer's disease and cardiometabolic traits.,"Identification of genetic risk factors that are shared between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other traits, i.e., pleiotropy, can help improve our understanding of the etiology of AD and potentially detect new therapeutic targets. Previous epidemiological correlations observed between cardiometabolic traits and AD led us to assess the pleiotropy between these traits. We performed a set of bivariate genome-wide association studies coupled with colocalization analysis to identify loci that are shared between AD and eleven cardiometabolic traits. For each of these loci, we performed colocalization with Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) to identify candidate causal genes. We identified three previously unreported pleiotropic trait associations at known AD loci as well as four novel pleiotropic loci. One associated locus was tagged by a low-frequency coding variant in the gene DOCK4 and is potentially implicated in its alternative splicing. Colocalization with GTEx eQTL data identified additional candidate genes for the loci we detected, including ACE, the target of the hypertensive drug class of ACE inhibitors. We found that the allele associated with decreased ACE expression in brain tissue was also associated with increased risk of AD, providing human genetic evidence of a potential increase in AD risk from use of an established anti-hypertensive therapeutic. Our results support a complex genetic relationship between AD and these cardiometabolic traits, and the candidate causal genes identified suggest that blood pressure and immune response play a role in the pleiotropy between these traits.",Alzheimer's research & therapy,2021,"Alzheimer Disease; Cardiovascular Diseases; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,1

We performed (1) Mendelian randomization analyses for previously reported cardiovascular associations and (2) Mendelian randomization-phenome-wide association analyses for novel associations. Analyses were stratified by ancestry in electronic Medical Records and Genomics, United Kingdom Biobank, and Million Veteran Program cohorts separately and in a combined cohort of 804 507 EA and 103 580 AA participants. In Mendelian randomization analyses using the combined cohort, a 1-SD genetic increase in Lp(a) level was associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease subtypes in EA-odds ratio and 95% CI for coronary heart disease 1.28 (1.16-1.41); cerebrovascular disease 1.14 (1.07-1.21); peripheral artery disease 1.22 (1.11-1.34); abdominal aortic aneurysm 1.28 (1.17-1.40); in AA, the effect estimate was lower than in EA and nonsignificant for coronary heart disease 1.11 (0.99-1.24) and cerebrovascular disease 1.06 (0.99-1.14) but similar for peripheral artery disease 1.16 (1.01-1.33) and abdominal aortic aneurysm 1.34 (1.11-1.62). In EA, a 1-SD genetic increase in Lp(a) level was associated with aortic valve disorders 1.34 (1.10-1.62), mitral valve disorders 1.18 (1.09-1.27), congestive heart failure 1.12 (1.05-1.19), and chronic kidney disease 1.07 (1.01-1.14).

Pairing depression polygenic scores with the results of clinical laboratory tests can reveal biological processes involved in depression etiology and in the physiological changes resulting from depression. To characterize the association between depression polygenic scores and an inflammatory biomarker, ie, white blood cell count. This genetic association study was conducted from May 19, 2019, to June 5, 2021, using electronic health record data from 382 452 patients across 4 health care systems. Analyses were conducted separately in each health care system and meta-analyzed across all systems. Primary analyses were conducted in Vanderbilt University Medical Center's biobank. Replication analyses were conducted across 3 other PsycheMERGE sites: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Mass General Brigham, and the Million Veteran Program. All patients with available genetic data and recorded white blood cell count measurements were included in the analyses. Primary analyses were conducted in individuals of European descent and then repeated in a population of individuals of African descent. Depression polygenic scores. White blood cell count. Across the 4 PsycheMERGE sites, there were 382 452 total participants of European ancestry (18.7% female; median age, 57.9 years) and 12 383 participants of African ancestry (61.1% female; median age, 39.0 [range, birth-90.0 years]). A laboratory-wide association scan revealed a robust association between depression polygenic scores and white blood cell count (β, 0.03; SE, 0.004; P = 1.07 × 10-17), which was replicated in a meta-analysis across the 4 health care systems (β, 0.03; SE, 0.002; P = 1.03 × 10-136). Mediation analyses suggested a bidirectional association, with white blood cell count accounting for 2.5% of the association of depression polygenic score with depression diagnosis (95% CI, 2.2%-20.8%; P = 2.84 × 10-70) and depression diagnosis accounting for 9.8% of the association of depression polygenic score with white blood cell count (95% CI, 8.4%-11.1%; P = 1.78 × 10-44). Mendelian randomization provided additional support for an association between increased white blood count and depression risk, but depression modeled as the exposure showed no evidence of an influence on white blood cell counts.

The study of the genetic association of BMI across a broad range of common disease conditions offers the opportunity to extend current knowledge regarding the breadth and depth of adiposity-related diseases. We identify 906 (364 novel) and 41 (6 novel) genome-wide significant loci for BMI among participants of European (N~1.1 million) and African (N~100,000) ancestry, respectively. Using a BMI genetic risk score including 2446 variants, 316 diagnoses are associated in the Million Veteran Program, with 96.5% showing increased risk. A co-morbidity network analysis reveals seven disease communities containing multiple interconnected diseases associated with BMI as well as extensive connections across communities. Mendelian randomization analysis confirms numerous phenotypes across a breadth of organ systems, including conditions of the circulatory (heart failure, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation), genitourinary (chronic renal failure), respiratory (respiratory failure, asthma), musculoskeletal and dermatologic systems that are deeply interconnected within and across the disease communities.

We document near equivalent heritability of CAD across multiple ancestral groups, identify 95 novel loci, including nine on the X chromosome, detect eight loci of genome-wide significance in Black and Hispanic individuals, and demonstrate that two common haplotypes at the 9p21 locus are responsible for risk stratification in all populations except those of African origin, in which these haplotypes are virtually absent. Moreover, in the largest GWAS for angiographically derived coronary atherosclerosis performed to date, we find 15 loci of genome-wide significance that robustly overlap with established loci for clinical CAD. Phenome-wide association analyses of novel loci and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) augment signals related to insulin resistance, extend pleiotropic associations of these loci to include smoking and family history, and precisely document the markedly reduced transferability of existing PRSs to Black individuals. Downstream integrative analyses reinforce the critical roles of vascular endothelial, fibroblast, and smooth muscle cells in CAD susceptibility, but also point to a shared biology between atherosclerosis and oncogenesis.

Both have substantial genetic etiology, which is partially shared and partially distinct from that of related psychiatric disorders. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 29,782 suicide attempt (SA) cases and 519,961 controls in the International Suicide Genetics Consortium (ISGC). The GWAS of SA was conditioned on psychiatric disorders using GWAS summary statistics via multitrait-based conditional and joint analysis, to remove genetic effects on SA mediated by psychiatric disorders. We investigated the shared and divergent genetic architectures of SA, psychiatric disorders, and other known risk factors. Two loci reached genome-wide significance for SA: the major histocompatibility complex and an intergenic locus on chromosome 7, the latter of which remained associated with SA after conditioning on psychiatric disorders and replicated in an independent cohort from the Million Veteran Program. This locus has been implicated in risk-taking behavior, smoking, and insomnia. SA showed strong genetic correlation with psychiatric disorders, particularly major depression, and also with smoking, pain, risk-taking behavior, sleep disturbances, lower educational attainment, reproductive traits, lower socioeconomic status, and poorer general health. After conditioning on psychiatric disorders, the genetic correlations between SA and psychiatric disorders decreased, whereas those with nonpsychiatric traits remained largely unchanged. Our results identify a risk locus that contributes more strongly to SA than other phenotypes and suggest a shared underlying biology between SA and known risk factors that is not mediated by psychiatric disorders.",Biological psychiatry,2022,"Depressive Disorder, Major; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Mental Disorders; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Suicide, Attempted",False,9

We first prioritize lipid-associated genes with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) colocalizations and then add chromatin interaction data to narrow the search for functional genes. Polygenic enrichment analysis across 697 annotations from a host of tissues and cell types confirms the central role of the liver in lipid levels and highlights the selective enrichment of adipose-specific chromatin marks in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Overlapping transcription factor (TF) binding sites with lipid-associated loci identifies TFs relevant in lipid biology. In addition, we present an integrative framework to prioritize causal variants at GWAS loci, producing a comprehensive list of candidate causal genes and variants with multiple layers of functional evidence.

Million Veteran Program,35613103,Genome-wide and phenome-wide analysis of ideal cardiovascular health in the VA Million Veteran Program.,"Genetic studies may help identify causal pathways; therefore, we sought to identify genetic determinants of ideal CVH and their association with CVD outcomes in the multi-population Veteran Administration Million Veteran Program. An ideal health score (IHS) was calculated from 3 clinical factors (blood pressure, total cholesterol, and blood glucose levels) and 3 behavioral factors (smoking status, physical activity, and BMI), ascertained at baseline. Multi-population genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed on IHS and binary ideal health using linear and logistic regression, respectively. Using the genome-wide significant SNPs from the IHS GWAS, we created a weighted IHS polygenic risk score (PRSIHS) which was used (i) to conduct a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of associations between PRSIHS and ICD-9 phenotypes and (ii) to further test for associations with mortality and selected CVD outcomes using logistic and Cox regression and, as an instrumental variable, in Mendelian Randomization. The discovery and replication cohorts consisted of 142,404 (119,129 European American (EUR); 16,495 African American (AFR)), and 45,766 (37,646 EUR; 5,366 AFR) participants, respectively. The mean age was 65.8 years (SD = 11.2) and 92.7% were male. Overall, 4.2% exhibited ideal CVH based on the clinical and behavioral factors. In the multi-population meta-analysis, variants at 17 loci were associated with IHS and each had known GWAS associations with multiple components of the IHS. PheWAS analysis in 456,026 participants showed that increased PRSIHS was associated with a lower odds ratio for many CVD outcomes and risk factors. Both IHS and PRSIHS measures of ideal CVH were associated with significantly less CVD outcomes and CVD mortality. A set of high interest genetic variants contribute to the presence of ideal CVH in a multi-ethnic cohort of US Veterans.

The MVP COVID-19 Survey was developed to collect COVID-19 specific elements including symptoms, diagnosis, hospitalization, behavioral and psychosocial factors and to augment existing MVP data with longitudinal collection of key domains in physical and mental health. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, a multipronged strategy was implemented to widely disseminate the COVID-19 Survey and capture data using both the online platform and mailings. We limited the findings of this paper to the initial phase of survey dissemination which began in May 2020. A total of 729,625 eligible MVP Veterans were invited to complete version 1 of the COVID-19 Survey. As of October 31, 2020, 58,159 surveys have been returned.

The objective of this study was to develop and validate a computable phenotype to identify primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) through accessing the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and Million Veteran Program (MVP) biobank. Accessing CPRS clinical ophthalmology data from VA Medical Center Eye Clinic (VAMCEC) patients, we developed and iteratively refined POAG case and control algorithms based on clinical, prescription, and structured diagnosis data (ICD-CM codes). Refinement was performed via detailed chart review, initially at a single VAMCEC (n = 200) and validated at two additional VAMCECs (n = 100 each). Positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were computed as the proportion of CPRS patients correctly classified with POAG or without POAG, respectively, by the algorithms, validated by ophthalmologists and optometrists with access to gold-standard clinical diagnosis data. The final algorithms performed better than previously reported approaches in assuring the accuracy and reproducibility of POAG classification (PPV >83% and NPV >97%) with consistent performance in Black or African American and in White Veterans.

In a prospective cohort study of US veterans from the Million Veteran Program (MVP), egg intake was collected through a self-reported food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Incidence of stroke was ascertained via ICD9/ICD10 codes from the electronic health records. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the multivariable adjusted hazard ratios. A total of 233,792 veterans (91.6% men) were studied with a mean age of 65.6 ± 11.7 years.

Veterans (N = 7483) were classified into three groups based on outcomes from the TBI Screening and Evaluation Program: (1) negative TBI screen ('Screen-'), (2) positive TBI screen but no TBI diagnosis ('Screen+/TBI-'), or (3) positive TBI screen and TBI diagnosis ('Screen+/TBI+'). Chi-square analyses revealed significant group differences across all self-reported cognitive and psychiatric health conditions (e.g., memory loss, depression), and ANCOVAs similarly showed a significant association between group and subjective symptom reporting. Specifically, the relationship between TBI group and clinical outcome (i.e., health conditions and symptoms) was such that the Screen+/TBI+ group fared the worst, followed by the Screen+/TBI- group, and finally the Screen- group. However, evaluation of effect sizes suggested that Veterans in the two Screen+ groups (Screen+/TBI+ and Screen+/TBI-) are faring similarly to one another on subjective cognitive and psychiatric functioning, but that both Screen+ groups are faring significantly worse than the Screen- group. Our results have meaningful clinical implications and suggest that Veterans who screen positive for TBI, regardless of ultimate TBI diagnosis, be eligible for similar clinical services so that both groups can benefit from valuable treatments and therapeutics.

ANCOVAs showed significant associations between diagnostic group and all aspects of social support. Pairwise comparisons revealed that Veterans in the two Screen+ groups (Screen+/TBI+ and Screen+/TBI-) reported comparable levels of social support, but that both Screen+ groups reported significantly lower levels of social support compared to the Screen- group. Among the Screen+ groups, adjusted linear regression models controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity showed significant associations between social support indices and all symptom measures, such that lower levels of social support were associated with more severe neurobehavioral and psychiatric symptoms and worse cognitive functioning. Finally, mediation analyses showed that psychiatric symptoms mediated the association between TBI screen group and social support.

To systematically examine this question, we performed a Mendelian Randomization-Phenome-wide association study (MR-PheWAS) using clinical and genetic data from a national healthcare system biobank. Analyses were performed using data from the US Veterans Affairs (VA) Million Veteran Program in non-Hispanic White (EA, n = 222,300) and non-Hispanic Black (AA, n = 58,151) adults in the US. We estimated height genetic risk based on 3290 height-associated variants from a recent European-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis. We compared associations of measured and genetically-predicted height with phenome-wide traits derived from the VA electronic health record, adjusting for age, sex, and genetic principal components. We found 345 clinical traits associated with measured height in EA and an additional 17 in AA. Of these, 127 were associated with genetically-predicted height at phenome-wide significance in EA and 2 in AA. These associations were largely independent from body mass index. We confirmed several previously described MR associations between height and cardiovascular disease traits such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease (CHD), and atrial fibrillation, and further uncovered MR associations with venous circulatory disorders and peripheral neuropathy in the presence and absence of diabetes. As a number of traits associated with genetically-predicted height frequently co-occur with CHD, we evaluated effect modification by CHD status of genetically-predicted height associations with risk factors for and complications of CHD. We found modification of effects of MR associations by CHD status for atrial fibrillation/flutter but not for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or venous circulatory disorders. We conclude that height may be an unrecognized but biologically plausible risk factor for several common conditions in adults. However, more studies are needed to reliably exclude horizontal pleiotropy as a driving force behind at least some of the MR associations observed in this study.",PLoS genetics,2022,"Adult; Atrial Fibrillation; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Hypertension; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Veterans",False,1

Design, Setting and Participants: Prospective cohort study of 180,156 Veterans aged 19 to 107 years with plausible dietary intake measured by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) who were free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer at baseline in the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP). Main outcome measures: CVD defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or acute ischemic stroke (AIS) ascertained using high-throughput phenotyping algorithms applied to electronic health records. Results: During up to 8 years of follow-up, we documented 4090 CVD cases (2499 MI and 1712 AIS). After adjustment for confounding factors, a higher sodium intake was associated with a higher risk of CVD, whereas potassium intake was inversely associated with the risk of CVD [hazard ratio (HR) comparing extreme quintiles, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09 (95% CI: 0.99−1.21, p trend = 0.01) for sodium and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79−0.96, p trend = 0.005) for potassium]. In addition, the ratio of sodium to potassium (Na/K ratio) was positively associated with the risk of CVD (HR comparing extreme quintiles = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.14−1.39, p trend < 0.0001). The associations of Na/K ratio were consistent for two subtypes of CVD; one standard deviation increment in the ratio was associated with HRs (95% CI) of 1.12 (1.06−1.19) for MI and 1.11 (1.03−1.19) for AIS. In secondary analyses, the observed associations were consistent across race and status for diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol at baseline. Associations appeared to be more pronounced among participants with poor dietary quality. Conclusions: A high sodium intake and a low potassium intake were associated with a higher risk of CVD in this large population of US veterans.",Nutrients,2022,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiovascular Diseases; Humans; Ischemic Stroke; Middle Aged; Potassium; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sodium, Dietary; Veterans; Young Adult",False,8
Million Veteran Program,36411363,Novel genetic loci associated with osteoarthritis in multi-ancestry analyses in the Million Veteran Program and UK Biobank.,"Osteoarthritis is a common progressive joint disease. As no effective medical interventions are available, osteoarthritis often progresses to the end stage, in which only surgical options such as total joint replacement are available. A more thorough understanding of genetic influences of osteoarthritis is essential to develop targeted personalized approaches to treatment, ideally long before the end stage is reached. To date, there have been no large multiancestry genetic studies of osteoarthritis. Here, we leveraged the unique resources of 484,374 participants in the Million Veteran Program and UK Biobank to address this gap. Analyses included participants of European, African, Asian and Hispanic descent. We discovered osteoarthritis-associated genetic variation at 10 loci and replicated findings from previous osteoarthritis studies. We also present evidence that some osteoarthritis-associated regions are robust to population ancestry.

Many variables (e.g., demographic, clinical, biological, geographic) have been associated with risk for suicide and suicidal behavior, including altitude; however, the exact nature of the relationship between altitude and suicide remains unclear in part due to the fact that previous studies have used either geospatial data or individual-level data, but not both. Prior research has also failed to consider the full range of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, ranging from suicidal ideation to suicide deaths. Accordingly, the objective of the present research was to use both geospatial data (county and zip codes) and individual-level data to comprehensively assess the association between altitude and suicide mortality, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation among US Veterans between 2000 and 2018. Taken together, our results demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between altitude and suicide rates at all the levels investigated and using different statistical analyses and even after controlling for significant covariates such as percent of age >50yr, percent male, percent white, percent non-Hispanic, median household income, and population density.

Additive-scale interactions were estimated using the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) statistic. PTSD, TBI, and APOE ε4 showed strong main-effect associations with ADRD. RERI analysis revealed significant additive APOE ε4 interactions with PTSD and TBI in the EA cohort and TBI in the AA cohort. These additive interactions indicate that ADRD prevalence associated with PTSD and TBI increased with the number of inherited APOE ε4 alleles.

Million Veteran Program,34318347,Hearing loss and tinnitus: association studies for complex-hearing disorders in mouse and man.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide an unbiased first look at genetic loci involved in aging and noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus. The hearing phenotype, whether audiogram-based or self-report, is regressed against genotyped information at representative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. Findings include the fact that both hearing loss and tinnitus are polygenic disorders, with up to thousands of genes, each of effect size of < 0.02. Smaller human GWAS' were able to use objective measures and identified a few loci; however, hundreds of thousands of participants have been required for the statistical power to identify significant variants, and GWAS is unable to assess rare variants with mean allele frequency < 1%. Animal studies are required as well because of inability to access the human cochlea. Mouse GWAS builds on linkage techniques and the known phenotypic differences in auditory function between inbred strains. With the advantage that the laboratory environment can be controlled for noise and aging, the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HDMP) combines 100 strains sequenced at high resolution. Lift-over regions between mice and humans have identified over 17,000 homologous genes. Since most significant SNPs are either intergenic or in introns, and binding sites between species are poorly preserved between species, expression quantitative trait locus information is required to bring humans and mice into agreement.

Patients with COVID-19 with AKI have high mortality rates. Individuals with African ancestry with 2 copies of apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) variants G1 or G2 (high-risk group) have significantly increased rates of kidney disease. We tested the hypothesis that the APOL1 high-risk group is associated with a higher-risk of COVID-19-associated AKI and death. This retrospective cohort study included 990 participants with African ancestry enrolled in the Million Veteran Program who were hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 2020 and January 2021 with available genetic information. The primary exposure was having 2 APOL1 risk variants (RV) (APOL1 high-risk group), compared with having 1 or 0 risk variants (APOL1 low-risk group). The primary outcome was AKI. The secondary outcomes were stages of AKI severity and death. Multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusted for preexisting comorbidities, medications, and inpatient AKI risk factors; 10 principal components of ancestry were performed to study these associations. We performed a subgroup analysis in individuals with normal kidney function prior to hospitalization (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Of the 990 participants with African ancestry, 905 (91.4%) were male with a median (IQR) age of 68 (60-73) years.

We conducted a Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) of genetic variants associated with critical illness (n = 35) or hospitalization (n = 42) due to severe COVID-19 using genome-wide association summary data from the Host Genetics Initiative. PheWAS analysis was performed using genotype-phenotype data from the Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program (MVP). Phenotypes were defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes mapped to clinically relevant groups using published PheWAS methods. Among 658,582 Veterans, variants associated with severe COVID-19 were tested for association across 1,559 phenotypes. Variants at the ABO locus (rs495828, rs505922) associated with the largest number of phenotypes (nrs495828 = 53 and nrs505922 = 59); strongest association with venous embolism, odds ratio (ORrs495828 1.33 (p = 1.32 x 10-199), and thrombosis ORrs505922 1.33, p = 2.2 x10-265.

We aimed to identify genes that confer PTSD risk through their effects on brain protein abundance to provide new insights into PTSD pathogenesis. To that end, we integrated human brain proteomes with PTSD GWAS results to perform a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) of PTSD, followed by Mendelian randomization, using a discovery and confirmatory study design. Brain proteomes (N = 525) were profiled from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using mass spectrometry. The Million Veteran Program (MVP) PTSD GWAS (n = 186,689) was used for the discovery PWAS, and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium PTSD GWAS (n = 174,659) was used for the confirmatory PWAS. To understand whether genes identified at the protein-level were also evident at the transcript-level, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using human brain transcriptomes (N = 888) and the MVP PTSD GWAS results. We identified 11 genes that contribute to PTSD pathogenesis via their respective cis-regulated brain protein abundance. Seven of 11 genes (64%) replicated in the confirmatory PWAS and 4 of 11 also had their cis-regulated brain mRNA levels associated with PTSD. High confidence level was assigned to 9 of 11 genes after considering evidence from the confirmatory PWAS and TWAS.

Million Veteran Program,35801699,Validation of a multi-ancestry polygenic risk score and age-specific risks of prostate cancer: A meta-analysis within diverse populations.,"We recently developed a multi-ancestry polygenic risk score (PRS) that effectively stratifies prostate cancer risk across populations. In this study, we validated the performance of the PRS in the multi-ancestry Million Veteran Program and additional independent studies. Within each ancestry population, the association of PRS with prostate cancer risk was evaluated separately in each case-control study and then combined in a fixed-effects inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis. We further assessed the effect modification by age and estimated the age-specific absolute risk of prostate cancer for each ancestry population. The PRS was evaluated in 31,925 cases and 490,507 controls, including men from European (22,049 cases, 414,249 controls), African (8794 cases, 55,657 controls), and Hispanic (1082 cases, 20,601 controls) populations. Comparing men in the top decile (90-100% of the PRS) to the average 40-60% PRS category, the prostate cancer odds ratio (OR) was 3.8-fold in European ancestry men (95% CI = 3.62-3.96), 2.8-fold in African ancestry men (95% CI = 2.59-3.03), and 3.2-fold in Hispanic men (95% CI = 2.64-3.92). The PRS did not discriminate risk of aggressive versus nonaggressive prostate cancer. However, the OR diminished with advancing age (European ancestry men in the top decile: ≤55 years, OR = 7.11; 55-60 years, OR = 4.26; >70 years, OR = 2.79). Men in the top PRS decile reached 5% absolute prostate cancer risk ~10 years younger than men in the 40-60% PRS category. Our findings validate the multi-ancestry PRS as an effective prostate cancer risk stratification tool across populations. A clinical study of PRS is warranted to determine whether the PRS could be used for risk-stratified screening and early detection.

Million Veteran Program,35267208,Evaluating risk for alcohol use disorder: Polygenic risk scores and family history.,"Early identification of individuals at high risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD) coupled with prompt interventions could reduce the incidence of AUD. In this study, we investigated whether Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) can be used to evaluate the risk for AUD and AUD severity (as measured by the number of DSM-5 AUD diagnostic criteria met) and compared their performance with a measure of family history of AUD. We studied individuals of European ancestry from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). DSM-5 diagnostic criteria were available for 7203 individuals, of whom 3451 met criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence or DSM-5 AUD and 1616 were alcohol-exposed controls aged ≥21 years with no history of AUD or drug dependence. Further, 4842 individuals had a positive first-degree family history of AUD (FH+), 2722 had an unknown family history (FH?), and 336 had a negative family history (FH-). PRS were derived from a meta-analysis of a genome-wide association study of AUD from the Million Veteran Program and scores from the problem subscale of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test in the UK Biobank. We used mixed models to test the association between PRS and risk for AUD and AUD severity. AUD cases had higher PRS than controls with PRS increasing as the number of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria increased (p-values ≤ 1.85E Both PRS and family history were associated with AUD and AUD severity, indicating that these risk measures assess distinct aspects of liability to AUD traits.","Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",2022,Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Risk Factors,False,1

Our objective was to analyze hearing loss and tinnitus, including audiogram data, of the Million Veteran Program within the context of military exposures in an aging population. Health records, questionnaires, audiograms, and military data were aggregated for 758,005 Veteran participants in the Million Veteran Program 2011 to 2020, with relative risks (RR) calculated for ancestries, sex, hearing loss and military exposures such as combat, blast, and military era served. A multivariate model with significant demographic measures and exposures was then analyzed. Next, audiogram data stratified by sex were compared for those with and without tinnitus by two methods: first, mean thresholds at standard frequencies were compared to thresholds adjusted per ISO 7029:2000E age and sex formulae. Second, levels for those ≤40 years of age were compared with those 41 and older. Finally, a proportional hazards model was examined to ascertain the timing between the onset of tinnitus and hearing loss, calculated separately for electronic health record diagnoses (ICD) and self-report. Tinnitus was either self-reported, diagnosed, or both in 37.5% (95% CI, 37.4 to 37.6), mean age 61.5 (95% CI, 61.4 to 61.5), range 18 to 112 years. Those with hearing loss were 4.15 times (95% CI, 4.12 to 4.15) as likely to have tinnitus. Americans of African descent were less likely to manifest tinnitus (RR 0.61, 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.61), as were women (RR 0.65, 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.65). A multivariate model indicated a higher RR of 1.73 for traumatic brain injury (95% CI, 1.71 to 1.73) and daily combat noise exposure (1.17, 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.17) than age (0.998, 95% CI, 0.997 to 0.998). Subjects ≤40 years of age had small but significantly elevated hearing thresholds through all standard frequencies compared to Veterans without tinnitus, and the effect of tinnitus on hearing thresholds diminished with age. In the hazard model, those >40 with new onset of tinnitus were at risk for hearing loss sooner and with greater incidence than those who were younger. The rate of hearing loss following tinnitus approached 100%. In contrast, only approximately 50% of those who self-reported hearing loss initially were at risk for later hearing loss, in contrast to ICD comparison, where those with ICD of hearing loss were more likely to sustain an ICD of tinnitus subsequently. Evidence suggests that the occurrence of tinnitus in the military is more closely related to environmental exposures than to aging. The finding that tinnitus affects hearing frequencies across the audiogram spectrum suggests an acoustic injury independent of tonotopicity. Particularly for males >40, tinnitus may be a harbinger of audiologic damage predictive of later hearing loss.",Ear and hearing,2022,"Aged; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Deafness; Female; Hearing; Hearing Loss, Noise-Induced; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Noise; Tinnitus; United States",False,2

Million Veteran Program,36494783,PRState: Incorporating genetic ancestry in prostate cancer risk scores for men of African ancestry.,"Prostate cancer (PrCa) is one of the most genetically driven solid cancers with heritability estimates as high as 57%. Men of African ancestry are at an increased risk of PrCa; however, current polygenic risk score (PRS) models are based on European ancestry groups and may not be broadly applicable. The objective of this study was to construct an African ancestry-specific PrCa PRS (PRState) and evaluate its performance. African ancestry group of 4,533 individuals in ELLIPSE consortium was used for discovery of African ancestry-specific PrCa SNPs. PRState was constructed as weighted sum of genotypes and effect sizes from genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PrCa in African ancestry group. Performance was evaluated using ROC-AUC analysis. We identified African ancestry-specific PrCa risk loci on chromosomes 3, 8, and 11 and constructed a polygenic risk score (PRS) from 10 African ancestry-specific PrCa risk SNPs, achieving an AUC of 0.61 [0.60-0.63] and 0.65 [0.64-0.67], when combined with age and family history. Performance dropped significantly when using ancestry-mismatched PRS models but remained comparable when using trans-ancestry models. Importantly, we validated the PRState score in the Million Veteran Program (MVP), demonstrating improved prediction of PrCa and metastatic PrCa in individuals of African ancestry. African ancestry-specific PRState improves PrCa prediction in African ancestry groups in ELLIPSE consortium and MVP. This study underscores the need for inclusion of individuals of African ancestry in gene variant discovery to optimize PRSs and identifies African ancestry-specific variants for use in future studies.",BMC cancer,2022,"Male; Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prostatic Neoplasms; Risk Factors",False,4

To date, however, no known study has used a prospective design to examine how polygenic risk scores (PRSs) interact with social-environmental factors such as attachment style to predict PTSD development. PRSs were derived from a genome-wide association study of PTSD symptoms (N = 186,689; Million Veteran Program cohort). We evaluated combined effects of PRS and attachment style in predicting incident PTSD in a 7-year, nationally representative cohort of trauma-exposed, European-American U.S. military veterans without PTSD (N = 1083). We also conducted multivariate gene-by-environment interaction and drug repositioning analyses to identify loci that interact with multiple environmental factors and potential pharmacotherapies that may be repurposed for this disorder. Veterans with higher PTSD PRS were more likely to have an incident-positive screen for PTSD over 7 years. A gene-by-environment interaction was also observed, such that higher PRS only predicted incident PTSD in veterans with an insecure attachment style and not those with a secure attachment style. At an individual locus level, the strongest gene-by-environment interaction was observed for the rs4702 variant of the FURIN gene with cumulative lifetime trauma burden. Drug repositioning revealed that genes implicated in PRS are perturbated by the drug doxylamine. Attachment style moderates polygenic risk for the development of PTSD in European-American veterans.

If concomitant aortic valve replacement is performed however, clinical evidence is more ambiguous and no explicit guidelines exist on the choice of mitral valve treatment. Both, double valve replacement (DVR) and aortic valve replacement in combination with concomitant mitral valve repair (AVR + MVP) have been proven to be feasible procedures. In our single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study, we compared the outcome of these two surgical techniques focusing on mortality and morbidity. 89 patients underwent DVR (n = 41) or AVR + MVP (n = 48) in our institution between 2009 and 2018. Follow-up data was collected using electronic patient records, by contacting treating physicians and by telephone interviews. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to analyze mortality during follow-up and Cox regression to investigate potential predictors of mortality. During a median follow-up duration of 4.5 [IQR 2.9 to 6.1] years, there was no significant difference in mortality between both cohorts. Thirty days mortality was 6.3% in the DVR and 7% in the AVR + MVP cohort. Overall mortality amounted to 17% for DVR and 23% for AVR + MVP. DVR was the preferred procedure for valve disease of rheumatic etiology and for endocarditis, while in degenerative valves AVR + MVP was predominant. More biological valves were used in the AVR + MVP cohort (p < 0.001) and more mechanical valves were implanted in the DVR cohort. The rate of rehospitalization, deterioration of left ventricular ejection fraction and postoperative complications were equally distributed among the two cohorts. Our data analysis showed that both DVR and AVR + MVP are safe and feasible options for double valve surgery.

Million Veteran Program,35794577,Identifying intragenic functional modules of genomic variations associated with cancer phenotypes by learning representation of association networks.,"Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) aims to uncover the link between genomic variation and phenotype. They have been actively applied in cancer biology to investigate associations between variations and cancer phenotypes, such as susceptibility to certain types of cancer and predisposed responsiveness to specific treatments. Since GWAS primarily focuses on finding associations between individual genomic variations and cancer phenotypes, there are limitations in understanding the mechanisms by which cancer phenotypes are cooperatively affected by more than one genomic variation. This paper proposes a network representation learning approach to learn associations among genomic variations using a prostate cancer cohort. The learned associations are encoded into representations that can be used to identify functional modules of genomic variations within genes associated with early- and late-onset prostate cancer. The proposed method was applied to a prostate cancer cohort provided by the Veterans Administration's Million Veteran Program to identify candidates for functional modules associated with early-onset prostate cancer. The cohort included 33,159 prostate cancer patients, 3181 early-onset patients, and 29,978 late-onset patients. The reproducibility of the proposed approach clearly showed that the proposed approach can improve the model performance in terms of robustness. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use a network representation learning approach to learn associations among genomic variations within genes. Associations learned in this way can lead to an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of how genomic variations cooperatively affect each cancer phenotype. This method can reveal unknown knowledge in the field of cancer biology and can be utilized to design more advanced cancer-targeted therapies.",BMC medical genomics,2022,Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Humans; Male; Phenotype; Prostatic Neoplasms; Reproducibility of Results,False,5

Predictive models for suicide risk have low sensitivity to many of these factors due to under-reporting in structured electronic health records (EHR) data. In this study, we show how natural language processing (NLP) can help identify LE in clinical notes at higher rates than reported medical codes. We compare domain-specific lexicons formulated from Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) selection, content analysis by subject matter experts (SME) and the Gravity Project, to data-driven expansion through contextual word embedding using Word2Vec. Our analysis covers EHR from the Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) and measures the prevalence of LE across time for patients with known underlying cause of death in the National Death Index (NDI). We found that NLP methods had higher sensitivity of detecting LE relative to structured EHR (S-EHR) variables. We observed that, on average, suicide cases had higher rates of LE over time when compared to patients who died of non-suicide related causes with no previous history of diagnosed mental illness. When used to discriminate these outcomes, the inclusion of NLP derived variables increased the concentration of LE along the top 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% of predicted risk.

In real clinical settings, longitudinal LDL-C data are often available through the electronic health record. It is unknown whether genetic testing for FH variants provides additional risk-stratifying information once longitudinal LDL-C is considered. We used the extensive electronic health record data available through the Million Veteran Program to conduct a nested case-control study. The primary outcome was coronary artery disease, derived from electronic health record codes for acute myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization. Incidence density sampling was used to match case/control exposure windows, defined by the date of the first LDL-C measurement to the date of the first coronary artery disease code of the index case.

Adjusting for mean LDL-C led to the greatest attenuation of the risk estimate, but significant risk remained (odds ratio, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.08-1.64]).

Numerous studies have sought to disentangle the causal relationship between dyslipidaemia and T2DM liability. However, conventional observational studies are vulnerable to confounding. Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies (which address this bias) on lipids and T2DM liability have focused on European ancestry individuals, with none to date having been performed in individuals of African ancestry. We therefore sought to use MR to investigate the causal effect of various lipid traits on T2DM liability in African ancestry individuals. Using univariable and multivariable two-sample MR, we leveraged summary-level data for lipid traits and T2DM liability from the African Partnership for Chronic Disease Research (APCDR) (N = 13,612, 36.9% men) and from African ancestry individuals in the Million Veteran Program (N Increased genetically proxied low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) levels were associated with increased T2DM liability in African ancestry individuals (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval, P-value] per standard deviation (SD) increase in LDL-C = 1.052 [1.000 to 1.106, P = 0.046] and per SD increase in TC = 1.089 [1.014 to 1.170, P = 0.019]). Conversely, increased genetically proxied high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was associated with reduced T2DM liability (OR per SD increase in HDL-C = 0.915 [0.843 to 0.993, P = 0.033]). The OR on T2DM per SD increase in genetically proxied triglyceride (TG) levels was 0.884 [0.773 to 1.011, P = 0.072] . With respect to lipid-lowering drug targets, we found that genetically proxied 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) inhibition was associated with increased T2DM liability (OR per SD decrease in genetically proxied LDL-C = 1.68 [1.03-2.72, P = 0.04]) but we did not find evidence of a relationship between genetically proxied proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition and T2DM liability. Consistent with MR findings in Europeans, HDL-C exerts a protective effect on T2DM liability and HMGCR inhibition increases T2DM liability in African ancestry individuals. However, in contrast to European ancestry individuals, LDL-C may increase T2DM liability in African ancestry individuals.

We aimed to identify genomic loci jointly associated with SCZ, BD, AUD and AC to gain further insights into their shared genetic architecture. We analysed summary data (P values and Z scores) from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using conjunctional false discovery rate (conjFDR) analysis, which increases power to discover shared genomic loci. We functionally characterized the identified loci using publicly available biological resources. AUD and AC data provided by the Million Veteran Program, derived from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. SCZ and BD data provided by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, based on cohorts from countries in Europe, North America and Australia. AUD (34 658 cases, 167 346 controls), AC (n = 200 680), SCZ (31 013 cases and 38 918 controls), BD (20 352 cases and 31 358 controls). All participants were of European ancestry. Genomic loci shared between alcohol traits, SCZ and BD at conjFDR <0.05. Conditional Q-Q plots showed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) enrichment for both alcohol traits across different levels of significance with SCZ and BD, and vice versa. Using conjFDR analysis we leveraged this genetic enrichment and identified several loci shared between SCZ and AUD (n = 28) and AC (n = 24), BD and AUD (n = 2) and AC (n = 8) at conjFDR <0.05. Among these loci, 24 are novel for AUD, 15 are novel for AC, three are novel for SCZ and one is novel for BD. There was a mixture of same and opposite effect directions among the shared loci. Alcohol use disorder and alcohol consumption share genomic loci with the psychiatric disorders schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with a mixed pattern of effect directions, indicating a complex genetic relationship between the phenotypes.","Addiction (Abingdon, England)",2022,"Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; Bipolar Disorder; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Schizophrenia",False,1
Million Veteran Program,35138379,Transcriptome-wide association study in UK Biobank Europeans identifies associations with blood cell traits.,"Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of hematological traits have identified over 10 000 distinct trait-specific risk loci. However, at these loci, the underlying causal mechanisms remain incompletely characterized. To elucidate novel biology and better understand causal mechanisms at known loci, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of 29 hematological traits in 399 835 UK Biobank (UKB) participants of European ancestry using gene expression prediction models trained from whole blood RNA-seq data in 922 individuals. We discovered 557 gene-trait associations for hematological traits distinct from previously reported GWAS variants in European populations. Among the 557 associations, 301 were available for replication in a cohort of 141 286 participants of European ancestry from the Million Veteran Program. Of these 301 associations, 108 replicated at a strict Bonferroni adjusted threshold ($\alpha$= 0.05/301). Using our TWAS results, we systematically assigned 4261 out of 16 900 previously identified hematological trait GWAS variants to putative target genes.

Evidence suggests that a quantitative approach to PTSD phenotype measurement and incorporation of lifetime trauma exposure (LTE) information could enhance the discovery power of PTSD genome-wide association studies (GWASs). A GWAS on PTSD symptoms was performed in 51 cohorts followed by a fixed-effects meta-analysis (N = 182,199 European ancestry participants). A GWAS of LTE burden was performed in the UK Biobank cohort (N = 132,988). Genetic correlations were evaluated with linkage disequilibrium score regression. Multivariate analysis was performed using Multi-Trait Analysis of GWAS. Functional mapping and annotation of leading loci was performed with FUMA. Replication was evaluated using the Million Veteran Program GWAS of PTSD total symptoms. GWASs of PTSD symptoms and LTE burden identified 5 and 6 independent genome-wide significant loci, respectively. There was a 72% genetic correlation between PTSD and LTE. PTSD and LTE showed largely similar patterns of genetic correlation with other traits, albeit with some distinctions. Adjusting PTSD for LTE reduced PTSD heritability by 31%. Multivariate analysis of PTSD and LTE increased the effective sample size of the PTSD GWAS by 20% and identified 4 additional loci. Four of these 9 PTSD loci were independently replicated in the Million Veteran Program. Through using a quantitative trait measure of PTSD, we identified novel risk loci not previously identified using prior case-control analyses.

Million Veteran Program,34611967,Genetic liability for substance use associated with medical comorbidities in electronic health records of African- and European-ancestry individuals.,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) represent an individual's summed genetic risk for a trait and can serve as biomarkers for disease. Less is known about the utility of PRS as a means to quantify genetic risk for substance use disorders (SUDs) than for many other traits. Nonetheless, the growth of large, electronic health record-based biobanks makes it possible to evaluate the association of SUD PRS with other traits. We calculated PRS for smoking initiation, alcohol use disorder (AUD), and opioid use disorder (OUD) using summary statistics from the Million Veteran Program sample. We then tested the association of each PRS with its primary phenotype in the Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB) using all available genotyped participants of African or European ancestry (AFR and EUR, respectively) (N = 18,612). Finally, we conducted phenome-wide association analyses (PheWAS) separately by ancestry and sex to test for associations across disease categories. Tobacco use disorder was the most common SUD in the PMBB, followed by AUD and OUD, consistent with the population prevalence of these disorders. All PRS were associated with their primary phenotype in both ancestry groups. PheWAS results yielded cross-trait associations across multiple domains, including psychiatric disorders and medical conditions. SUD PRS were associated with their primary phenotypes; however, they are not yet predictive enough to be useful diagnostically. The cross-trait associations of the SUD PRS are indicative of a broader genetic liability.

Million Veteran Program,36301540,Genome-Wide Investigation of Maximum Habitual Alcohol Intake in US Veterans in Relation to Alcohol Consumption Traits and Alcohol Use Disorder.,"Alcohol genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have generally focused on alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder (AUD); few have examined habitual drinking behaviors like maximum habitual alcohol intake (MaxAlc). To identify genetic loci associated with MaxAlc and to elucidate the genetic architecture across alcohol traits. This MaxAlc genetic association study was performed among Million Veteran Program participants enrolled from January 10, 2011, to September 30, 2020. Ancestry-specific GWASs were conducted in participants with European (n = 218 623) and African (n = 29 132) ancestry, then meta-analyzed (N = 247 755). Linkage-disequilibrium score regression was used to estimate single nucleotide variant (SNV)-heritability and genetic correlations (rg) with other alcohol and psychiatric traits. Genomic structural equation modeling (gSEM) was used to evaluate genetic associations between MaxAlc and other alcohol traits. Mendelian randomization was used to examine potential causal relationships between MaxAlc and liver enzyme levels. MTAG (multitrait analysis of GWAS) was used to analyze MaxAlc and problematic alcohol use (PAU) jointly. Genetic associations. MaxAlc was defined from the following survey item: ""in a typical month, what is/was the largest number of drinks of alcohol you may have had in one day?"" with ordinal responses from 0 to 15 or more drinks. GWASs were conducted on sample sizes of as many as 247 455 US veterans. Participants were 92.68% male and had mean (SD) age of 65.92 (11.70) years. The MaxAlc GWAS resulted in 15 genome-wide significant loci. Top associations in European-ancestry and African-ancestry participants were with known functional variants in the ADH1B gene, namely rs1229984 (P = 3.12 × 10-101) and rs2066702 (P = 6.30 × 10-17), respectively. Novel associations were also found. SNV-heritability was 6.65% (SE, 0.41) in European-ancestry participants and 3.42% (SE, 1.46) in African-ancestry participants. MaxAlc was positively correlated with PAU (rg = 0.79; P = 3.95 × 10-149) and AUD (rg = 0.76; P = 1.26 × 10-127) and had negative rg with the UK Biobank ""alcohol usually taken with meals"" (rg = -0.53; P = 1.40 × 10-50). For psychiatric traits, MaxAlc had the strongest genetic correlation with suicide attempt (rg = 0.40; P = 3.02 × 10-21). gSEM supported a 2-factor model with MaxAlc loading on a factor with PAU and AUD and other alcohol consumption measures loading on a separate factor. Mendelian randomization supported an association between MaxAlc and the liver enzyme gamma-glutamyltransferase (β = 0.012; P = 2.66 × 10-10). MaxAlc MTAG resulted in 31 genome-wide significant loci. The findings suggest that MaxAlc closely aligns genetically with PAU traits.

Million Veteran Program,35287516,Development of a polygenic risk score to improve detection of peripheral artery disease.,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, yet timely diagnosis is elusive. Larger genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have now provided the ability to evaluate whether genetic data, in the form of genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS), can help improve our ability to identify patients at high risk of having PAD. Using summary statistic data from the largest PAD GWAS from the Million Veteran Program, we developed PRSs with genome data from UK Biobank. We then evaluated the clinical utility of adding the best-performing PRS to a PAD clinical risk score. A total of 487,320 participants (5759 PAD cases) were included in our final genetic analysis. Compared to participants in the lowest 10% of PRS, those in the highest decile had 3.1 higher odds of having PAD (95% CI, 3.06-3.21). Additionally, a PAD PRS was associated with increased risk of having coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease. The PRS significantly improved a clinical risk model (Net Reclassification Index = 0.07,  We demonstrate that a genome-wide PRS can discriminate risk of PAD and other cardiovascular diseases.

Million Veteran Program,35716666,Genetic interactions drive heterogeneity in causal variant effect sizes for gene expression and complex traits.,"Despite the growing number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs), it remains unclear to what extent gene-by-gene and gene-by-environment interactions influence complex traits in humans. The magnitude of genetic interactions in complex traits has been difficult to quantify because GWASs are generally underpowered to detect individual interactions of small effect. Here, we develop a method to test for genetic interactions that aggregates information across all trait-associated loci. Specifically, we test whether SNPs in regions of European ancestry shared between European American and admixed African American individuals have the same causal effect sizes. We hypothesize that in African Americans, the presence of genetic interactions will drive the causal effect sizes of SNPs in regions of European ancestry to be more similar to those of SNPs in regions of African ancestry. We apply our method to two traits: gene expression in 296 African Americans and 482 European Americans in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in 74K African Americans and 296K European Americans in the Million Veteran Program (MVP). We find significant evidence for genetic interactions in our analysis of gene expression; for LDL-C, we observe a similar point estimate, although this is not significant, most likely due to lower statistical power. These results suggest that gene-by-gene or gene-by-environment interactions modify the effect sizes of causal variants in human complex traits.",American journal of human genetics,2022,"Cholesterol, LDL; Gene Expression; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Multifactorial Inheritance; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; White People",False,6
Million Veteran Program,36517512,Genetic architecture of heart failure with preserved versus reduced ejection fraction.,"Pharmacologic clinical trials for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction have been largely unsuccessful as compared to those for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Whether differences in the genetic underpinnings of these major heart failure subtypes may provide insights into the disparate outcomes of clinical trials remains unknown. We utilize a large, uniformly phenotyped, single cohort of heart failure sub-classified into heart failure with reduced and with preserved ejection fractions based on current clinical definitions, to conduct detailed genetic analyses of the two heart failure sub-types. We find different genetic architectures and distinct genetic association profiles between heart failure with reduced and with preserved ejection fraction suggesting differences in underlying pathobiology. The modest genetic discovery for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (one locus) compared to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (13 loci) despite comparable sample sizes indicates that clinically defined heart failure with preserved ejection fraction likely represents the amalgamation of several, distinct pathobiological entities. Development of consensus sub-phenotyping of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is paramount to better dissect the underlying genetic signals and contributors to this highly prevalent condition.",Nature communications,2022,"Humans; Stroke Volume; Heart Failure; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left",False,2

We aimed to investigate the genetic and clinical determinants of abdominal aortic diameter (AAD). We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies in 10 cohorts (n = 13 542) imputed to the 1000 Genome Project reference panel including 12 815 subjects in the discovery phase and 727 subjects [Partners Biobank cohort 1 (PBIO)] as replication. Maximum anterior-posterior diameter of the infrarenal aorta was used as AAD. We also included exome array data (n = 14 480) from seven epidemiologic studies. Single-variant and gene-based associations were done using SeqMeta package. A Mendelian randomization analysis was applied to investigate the causal effect of a number of clinical risk factors on AAD.

Beyond severe physical symptoms, endometriosis is also associated with several psychiatric comorbidities, including depression and anxiety. To investigate whether pleiotropy contributes to the association of endometriosis with depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. This genetic association study was performed between September 13, 2021, and June 24, 2022, in 202 276 unrelated female participants. Genotypic and phenotypic information from the UK Biobank was combined with genome-wide association statistics available from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (11 countries), the Million Veteran Program (US), the FinnGen study (Finland), and the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) consortium (5 countries). The main outcomes were the phenotypic and genetic associations of endometriosis with anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. A total of 8276 women with endometriosis (mean [SD] age, 53.1 [7.9] years) and 194 000 female controls (mean [SD] age, 56.7 [7.9] years) were included in the study. In a multivariate regression analysis accounting for age, body mass index, socioeconomic status, chronic pain-related phenotypes, irritable bowel syndrome, and psychiatric comorbidities, endometriosis was associated with increased odds of depression (odds ratio [OR], 3.61; 95% CI, 3.32-3.92), eating disorders (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.96-4.41), and anxiety (OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 2.30-2.97).

Million Veteran Program,37001235,The causal effects of lipid traits on kidney function in Africans: bidirectional and multivariable Mendelian-randomization study.,"Observational studies have investigated the effect of serum lipids on kidney function, but these findings are limited by confounding, reverse causation and have reported conflicting results. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies address this confounding problem. However, they have been conducted mostly in European ancestry individuals. We, therefore, set out to investigate the effect of lipid traits on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on serum creatinine in individuals of African ancestry. We used the two-sample and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) approaches; in which instrument variables (IV's) for the predictor (lipid traits) were derived from summary-level data of a meta-analyzed African lipid GWAS (MALG, n = 24,215) from the African Partnership for Chronic Disease Research (APCDR) (n = 13,612) & the Africa Wits-IN-DEPTH partnership for Genomics studies (AWI-Gen) dataset (n = 10,603). The outcome IV's were computed from the eGFR summary-level data of African-ancestry individuals within the Million Veteran Program (n = 57,336). A random-effects inverse variance method was used in our primary analysis, and pleiotropy was adjusted for using robust and penalized sensitivity testing. The lipid predictors for the MVMR were high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG). We found a significant causal association between genetically predicted low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and eGFR in African ancestry individuals β = 1.1 (95% CI [0.411-1.788]; p = 0.002). Similarly, total cholesterol (TC) showed a significant causal effect on eGFR β = 1.619 (95% CI [0.412-2.826]; p = 0.009). However, the IVW estimate showed that genetically predicted HDL-C β = -0.164, (95% CI = [-1.329 to 1.00]; p = 0.782), and TG β = -0.934 (CI = [-2.815 to 0.947]; p = 0.33) were not significantly causally associated with the risk of eGFR. In the multivariable analysis inverse-variance weighted (MVIVW) method, there was evidence for a causal association between LDL and eGFR β = 1.228 (CI = [0.477-1.979]; p = 0.001). A significant causal effect of Triglycerides (TG) on eGFR in the MVIVW analysis β = -1.3 ([-2.533 to -0.067]; p = 0.039) was observed as well. All the causal estimates reported reflect a unit change in the outcome per a 1 SD increase in the exposure. HDL showed no evidence of a significant causal association with eGFR in the MVIVW method (β = -0.117 (95% CI [-1.252 to 0.018]; p = 0.840)). We found no evidence of a reverse causal impact of eGFR on serum lipids. All our sensitivity analyses indicated no strong evidence of pleiotropy or heterogeneity between our instrumental variables for both the forward and reverse MR analysis. In this African ancestry population, genetically predicted higher LDL-C and TC are causally associated with higher eGFR levels, which may suggest that the relationship between LDL, TC and kidney function may be U-shaped. And as such, lowering LDL_C does not necessarily improve risk of kidney disease. This may also imply the reason why LDL_C is seen to be a poorer predictor of kidney function compared to HDL. In addition, this further supports that more work is warranted to confirm the potential association between lipid traits and risk of kidney disease in individuals of African Ancestry.

Million Veteran Program,37798822,Genetic Inhibition of APOL1 Pore-Forming Function Prevents APOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease.,"African Americans are at increased risk of CKD in part due to high-risk (HR) variants in the apolipoprotein L1 ( APOL1 ) gene, termed G1/G2. A different APOL1 variant, p.N264K , reduced the risk of CKD and ESKD among carriers of APOL1 HR variants to levels comparable with individuals with APOL1 low-risk variants in an analysis of 121,492 participants of African ancestry from the Million Veteran Program (MVP). Functional genetic studies in cell models showed that APOL1 p.N264K blocked APOL1 pore-forming function and ion channel conduction and reduced toxicity of APOL1 HR mutations. Pharmacologic inhibitors that mimic this mutation blocking APOL1 -mediated pore formation may be able to prevent and/or treat APOL1 -associated kidney disease. African Americans are at increased risk for nondiabetic CKD in part due to HR variants in the APOL1 gene. We tested whether a different APOL1 variant, p.N264K , modified the association between APOL1 HR genotypes (two copies of G1/G2) and CKD in a cross-sectional analysis of 121,492 participants of African ancestry from the MVP. We replicated our findings in the Vanderbilt University Biobank ( n =14,386) and National Institutes of Health All of Us ( n =14,704). Primary outcome was CKD and secondary outcome was ESKD among nondiabetic patients. Primary analysis compared APOL1 HR genotypes with and without p.N264K . Secondary analyses included APOL1 low-risk genotypes and tested for interaction. In MVP, we performed sequential logistic regression models adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, medications, and ten principal components of ancestry. Functional genomic studies expressed APOL1 HR variants with and without APOL1 p.N264K in cell models. In the MVP cohort, 15,604 (12.8%) had two APOL1 HR variants, of which 582 (0.5%) also had APOL1 p.N264K . In MVP, 18,831 (15%) had CKD, 4177 (3%) had ESKD, and 34% had diabetes.

Million Veteran Program,37261792,Genome-Wide Association Study of CKD Progression.,"Rapid progression of CKD is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Most previous studies looking for genetic factors associated with low eGFR have used cross-sectional data. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of eGFR decline among 116,870 participants with CKD, focusing on longitudinal data. They identified three loci (two of them novel) associated with longitudinal eGFR decline. In addition to the known UMOD/PDILT locus, variants within BICC1 were associated with significant differences in longitudinal eGFR slope. Variants within HEATR4 also were associated with differences in eGFR decline, but only among Black/African American individuals without diabetes. These findings help characterize molecular mechanisms of eGFR decline in CKD and may inform new therapeutic approaches for progressive kidney disease. Rapid progression of CKD is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite extensive study of the genetics of cross-sectional eGFR, only a few loci associated with eGFR decline over time have been identified. We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of eGFR decline among 116,870 participants with CKD-defined by two outpatient eGFR measurements of <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , obtained 90-365 days apart-from the Million Veteran Program and Vanderbilt University Medical Center's DNA biobank. The primary outcome was the annualized relative slope in outpatient eGFR. Analyses were stratified by ethnicity and diabetes status and meta-analyzed thereafter. In cross-ancestry meta-analysis, the strongest association was rs77924615, near UMOD / PDILT ; each copy of the G allele was associated with a 0.30%/yr faster eGFR decline ( P = 4.9×10 -27 ). We also observed an association within BICC1 (rs11592748), where every additional minor allele was associated with a 0.13%/yr slower eGFR decline ( P = 5.6×10 -9 ). Among participants without diabetes, the strongest association was the UMOD/PDILT variant rs36060036, associated with a 0.27%/yr faster eGFR decline per copy of the C allele ( P = 1.9×10 -17 ). Among Black participants, a significantly faster eGFR decline was associated with variant rs16996674 near APOL1 (R 2 =0.29 with the G1 high-risk genotype); among Black participants with diabetes, lead variant rs11624911 near HEATR4 also was associated with a significantly faster eGFR decline. We also nominally replicated loci with known associations with eGFR decline, near PRKAG2, FGF5, and C15ORF54. Three loci were significantly associated with longitudinal eGFR change at genome-wide significance. These findings help characterize molecular mechanisms of eGFR decline and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches for progressive CKD.",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,2023,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Kidney; Genotype; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Disease Progression; Apolipoprotein L1; Protein Disulfide-Isomerases",False,0

We leverage multiple downstream analytic methods to identify causal TAAD risk genes and cell types and provide human genetic evidence that TAAD is a non-atherosclerotic aortic disorder distinct from other forms of vascular disease. Our results demonstrate that the genetic architecture of TAAD mirrors that of other complex traits and that it is not solely inherited through protein-altering variants of large effect size.",Nature genetics,2023,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Veterans; Pedigree; Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic; Aortic Dissection",False,6
Million Veteran Program,38065710,Impact of 8 lifestyle factors on mortality and life expectancy among United States veterans: The Million Veteran Program.,"Lifestyle medicine has been proposed as a way to address the root causes of chronic disease and their associated health care costs. This study aimed to estimate mortality risk and longevity associated with individual lifestyle factors and comprehensive lifestyle therapy. Age- and sex-specific mortality rates were calculated on the basis of 719,147 veterans aged 40-99 y enrolled in the Veteran Affairs Million Veteran Program (2011-2019). Hazard ratios and estimated increase in life expectancy were examined among a subgroup of 276,132 veterans with complete data on 8 lifestyle factors at baseline. The 8 lifestyle factors included never smoking, physical activity, no excessive alcohol consumption, restorative sleep, nutrition, stress management, social connections, and no opioid use disorder. On the basis of 1.12 million person-years of follow-up, 34,247 deaths were recorded. Among veterans who adopted 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 lifestyle factors, the adjusted hazard ratios for mortality were 0.74 (0.60-0.90), 0.60 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.73), 0.50 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.61), 0.43 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.52), 0.35 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.43), 0.27 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.33), 0.21 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.26), and 0.13 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.16), respectively, as compared with veterans with no adopted lifestyle factors. The estimated life expectancy at age 40 y was 23.0, 26.5, 28.8, 30.8, 32.7, 35.1, 38.3, 41.3, and 47.0 y among males and 27.0, 28.8, 33.1, 38.0, 39.2, 41.4, 43.8, 46.3, and 47.5 y for females who adopted 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 lifestyle factors, respectively. The difference in life expectancy at age 40 y was 24.0 y for male veterans and 20.5 y for female veterans when comparing adoption of 8-9 lifestyle factors.

Million Veteran Program,37962888,Mendelian Randomization Analysis of Genetic Proxies of Thiazide Diuretics and the Reduction of Kidney Stone Risk.,"Clinical trial data have called into question the efficacy of thiazide diuretics for the prevention of kidney stones. To identify whether there is an association between genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics and the risk of kidney stones. This genetic association study undertook a mendelian randomization analysis of derived exposures and outcomes from genome-wide association study summary statistics. Genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were derived from the International Consortium for Blood Pressure. Kidney stone cases and controls were derived from the Million Veteran Program, UK Biobank, and the FinnGen study. These cross-sectional designs do not report a duration of follow-up. Data analysis was performed in May 2023. Genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were genetic variants in the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter gene associated with systolic blood pressure. Genetic proxies of β-blockers and systolic blood pressure served as negative controls. The main outcome was the odds of kidney stones. The secondary outcomes were serum laboratory values relevant to the treatment of kidney stones. The main analysis included up to 1 079 657 individuals, including 50 832 kidney stone cases and 1 028 825 controls. In a meta-analysis of all cohorts, genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were associated with a lower odds of kidney stones (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.81-0.89; P < .001). Genetic proxies of β-blockers (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.07; P = .52) and systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01; P = .49) were not associated with kidney stones. Genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were associated with higher serum calcium (β [SE], 0.051 [0.0092]; P < .001) and total cholesterol (β [SE], 0.065 [0.015]; P < .001), but lower serum potassium (β [SE], -0.073 [0.022]; P < .001). In this genetic association study, genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were associated with reduced kidney stone risk.

Two large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) recently discovered and cross-validated genome-wide significant (GWS) loci for suicide attempt (SA). The present study leveraged the genetic cohorts from both studies to conduct the largest GWAS meta-analysis of SA to date. Multi-ancestry and admixture-specific meta-analyses were conducted within groups of significant African, East Asian, and European ancestry admixtures. This study comprised 22 cohorts, including 43,871 SA cases and 915,025 ancestry-matched controls. Analytical methods across multi-ancestry and individual ancestry admixtures included inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analyses, followed by gene, gene-set, tissue-set, and drug-target enrichment, as well as summary-data-based Mendelian randomization with brain expression quantitative trait loci data, phenome-wide genetic correlation, and genetic causal proportion analyses. Multi-ancestry and European ancestry admixture GWAS meta-analyses identified 12 risk loci at p values <5×10 This multi-ancestry analysis of suicide attempt identified several loci contributing to risk and establishes significant shared genetic covariation with clinical phenotypes.

However, several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses concluded with no or weak evidence for limiting red meat intake. To prospectively examine the associations between red meat intake and incident CVD in an ongoing cohort study with diverse socioeconomic and racial or ethnic backgrounds. Our study included 148,506 participants [17,804 female (12.0%)] who were free of cancer, diabetes, and CVD at baseline from the Million Veteran Program. A food frequency questionnaire measured red meat intakes at baseline. Nonfatal myocardial infarction and acute ischemic stroke were identified through a high-throughput phenotyping algorithm, and fatal CVD events were identified by searching the National Death Index. Comparing the extreme categories of intake, the multivariate-adjusted relative risks of CVD was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.38; P-trend < 0.0001) for total red meat, 1.14 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.36; P-trend = 0.01) for unprocessed red meat, and 1.29 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.60; P-trend = 0.003) for processed red meat. We observed a more pronounced positive association between red meat intake and CVD in African American participants than in White participants (P-interaction = 0.01). Replacing 0.5 servings/d of red meat with 0.5 servings/d of nuts, whole grains, and skimmed milk was associated with 14% (RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.90), 7% (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.96), and 4% (RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.99) lower risks of CVD, respectively.

Million Veteran Program,37845353,Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies risk loci for abdominal aortic aneurysm and highlights PCSK9 as a therapeutic target.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common disease with substantial heritability. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis from 14 discovery cohorts and uncovered 141 independent associations, including 97 previously unreported loci. A polygenic risk score derived from meta-analysis explained AAA risk beyond clinical risk factors. Genes at AAA risk loci indicate involvement of lipid metabolism, vascular development and remodeling, extracellular matrix dysregulation and inflammation as key mechanisms in AAA pathogenesis. These genes also indicate overlap between the development of AAA and other monogenic aortopathies, particularly via transforming growth factor β signaling. Motivated by the strong evidence for the role of lipid metabolism in AAA, we used Mendelian randomization to establish the central role of nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol in AAA and identified the opportunity for repurposing of proprotein convertase, subtilisin/kexin-type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. This was supported by a study demonstrating that PCSK9 loss of function prevented the development of AAA in a preclinical mouse model.",Nature genetics,2023,"Humans; Animals; Mice; Genome-Wide Association Study; Proprotein Convertase 9; Subtilisin; Proprotein Convertases; Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal",False,7

CAS genetic architecture was compared with that of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Causal inference for cardiometabolic biomarkers in CAS was performed using Mendelian randomization and genome-wide significant loci were characterized further through phenome-wide association study. We identified 23 genome-wide significant lead variants in our GWAS representing 17 unique genomic regions. Of the 23 lead variants, 14 were significant in replication, representing 11 unique genomic regions. Five replicated genomic regions were previously known risk loci for CAS ( We performed a multiancestry GWAS in CAS and identified 6 novel genomic regions in the disease.

Million Veteran Program,36378845,Immunogenetic Determinants of Susceptibility to Head and Neck Cancer in the Million Veteran Program Cohort.,"Increasing rates of human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) have largely offset declines in tobacco-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) at non-OPC sites. Host immunity is an important modulator of HPV infection, persistence, and clearance, and also of immune evasion in both virally- and nonvirally-driven cancers. However, the association between collective known cancer-related immune gene variants and HNSCC susceptibility has not been fully characterized. Here, we conducted a genetic association study in the multiethnic Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program cohort, evaluating 16,050 variants in 1,576 immune genes in 4,012 HNSCC cases (OPC = 1,823; non-OPC = 2,189) and 16,048 matched controls. Significant polymorphisms were further examined in a non-Hispanic white (NHW) validation cohort (OPC = 1,206; non-OPC = 955; controls = 4,507). For overall HNSCC susceptibility in NHWs, we discovered and validated a novel 9q31.1 SMC2 association and replicated the known 6p21.32 HLA-DQ-DR association. Six loci/genes for overall HNSCC susceptibility were selectively enriched in African-Americans (6p21.32 HLA-G, 9q21.33 GAS1, 11q12.2 CD6, 11q23.2 NCAM1/CD56, 17p13.1 CD68, 18q22.2 SOCS6); all 6 genes function in antigen-presenting regulation and T-cell activation. Two additional loci (10q26 DMBT1, 15q22.2 TPM1) were uncovered for non-OPC susceptibility, and three loci (11q24 CRTAM, 16q21 CDH5, 18q12.1 CDH2) were identified for HPV-positive OPC susceptibility. This study underscores the role of immune gene variants in modulating susceptibility for both HPV-driven and non-HPV-driven HNSCC. Additional large studies, particularly in racially diverse populations, are needed to further validate the associations and to help elucidate other potential immune factors and mechanisms that may underlie HNSCC risk.

Million Veteran Program,37735503,Loneliness and depression: bidirectional mendelian randomization analyses using data from three large genome-wide association studies.,"Major depression (MD) is a serious psychiatric illness afflicting nearly 5% of the world's population. A large correlational literature suggests that loneliness is a prospective risk factor for MD; correlational assocations of this nature may be confounded for a variety of reasons. This report uses Mendelian Randomization (MR) to examine potentially causal associations between loneliness and MD. We report on analyses using summary statistics from three large genome wide association studies (GWAS). MR analyses were conducted using three independent sources of GWAS summary statistics. In the first set of analyses, we used available summary statistics from an extant GWAS of loneliness to predict MD risk. We used two sources of outcome data: the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) meta-analysis of MD (PGC-MD; N = 142,646) and the Million Veteran Program (MVP-MD; N = 250,215). Finally, we reversed analyses using data from the MVP and PGC samples to identify risk variants for MD and used loneliness outcome data from UK Biobank. We find robust evidence for a bidirectional causal relationship between loneliness and MD, including between loneliness, depression cases status, and a continuous measure of depressive symptoms. The estimates remained significant across several sensitivity analyses, including models that account for horizontal pleiotropy. This paper provides the first genetically-informed evidence that reducing loneliness may play a causal role in decreasing risk for depressive illness, and these findings support efforts to reduce loneliness in order to prevent or ameliorate MD. Discussion focuses on the public health significance of these findings, especially in light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",Molecular psychiatry,2023,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Depression; Loneliness; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Prospective Studies; Depressive Disorder, Major",False,9

We observed a high degree of cross-ancestral similarity in the genetic architecture of PAU and identified 110 independent risk variants in within- and cross-ancestry analyses. Cross-ancestry fine mapping improved the identification of likely causal variants. Prioritizing genes through gene expression and chromatin interaction in brain tissues identified multiple genes associated with PAU. We identified existing medications for potential pharmacological studies by a computational drug repurposing analysis. Cross-ancestry polygenic risk scores showed better performance of association in independent samples than single-ancestry polygenic risk scores.

Million Veteran Program,37967698,Brainwide Mendelian Randomization Study of Anxiety Disorders and Symptoms.,"To gain insights into the role of brain structure and function on anxiety (ANX), we conducted a genetically informed investigation leveraging information from ANX genome-wide association studies available from the UK Biobank (n = 380,379), the FinnGen Program (n = 290,361), and the Million Veteran Program (n = 175,163) together with UK Biobank genome-wide data (n = 33,224) related to 3935 brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs). A genetic correlation analysis between ANX and brain IDPs was performed using linkage disequilibrium score regression. To investigate ANX-brain associations, a 2-sample Mendelian randomization was performed considering multiple methods and sensitivity analyses. A subsequent multivariable Mendelian randomization was conducted to distinguish between direct and indirect effects. Finally, a generalized linear model was used to explore the associations of brain IDPs with ANX symptoms. After false discovery rate correction (q < .05), we identified 41 brain IDPs genetically correlated with ANX without heterogeneity among the datasets investigated (i.e., UK Biobank, FinnGen, and Million Veteran Program). Six of these IDPs showed genetically inferred causal effects on ANX.

To identify novel, replicable genomic risk loci for SITB. This genome-wide association study included 633 778 US military veterans with and without SITB, as identified through electronic health records. GWAS was performed separately by ancestry, controlling for sex, age, and genetic substructure. Cross-ancestry risk loci were identified through meta-analysis. Study enrollment began in 2011 and is ongoing. Data were analyzed from November 2021 to August 2022. SITB. A total of 633 778 US military veterans were included in the analysis (57 152 [9%] female; 121 118 [19.1%] African ancestry, 8285 [1.3%] Asian ancestry, 452 767 [71.4%] European ancestry, and 51 608 [8.1%] Hispanic ancestry), including 121 211 individuals with SITB (19.1%). Meta-analysis identified more than 200 GWS (P < 5 × 10-8) cross-ancestry risk single-nucleotide variants for SITB concentrated in 7 regions on chromosomes 2, 6, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 18. Top single-nucleotide variants were largely intronic in nature; 5 were independently replicated in ISGC, including rs6557168 in ESR1, rs12808482 in DRD2, rs77641763 in EXD3, rs10671545 in DCC, and rs36006172 in TRAF3. Associations for FBXL19 and AC018880.2 were not replicated. Gene-based analyses implicated 24 additional GWS cross-ancestry risk genes, including FURIN, TSNARE1, and the NCAM1-TTC12-ANKK1-DRD2 gene cluster. Cross-ancestry enrichment analyses revealed significant enrichment for expression in brain and pituitary tissue, synapse and ubiquitination processes, amphetamine addiction, parathyroid hormone synthesis, axon guidance, and dopaminergic pathways. Seven other unique European ancestry-specific GWS loci were identified, 2 of which (POM121L2 and METTL15/LINC02758) were replicated. Two additional GWS ancestry-specific loci were identified within the African ancestry (PET112/GATB) and Hispanic ancestry (intergenic locus on chromosome 4) subsets, both of which were replicated. No GWS loci were identified within the Asian ancestry subset; however, significant enrichment was observed for axon guidance, cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling, focal adhesion, glutamatergic synapse, and oxytocin signaling pathways across all ancestries. Within the European ancestry subset, genetic correlations (r > 0.75) were observed between the SITB phenotype and a suicide attempt-only phenotype, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Additionally, polygenic risk score analyses revealed that the Million Veteran Program polygenic risk score had nominally significant main effects in 2 independent samples of veterans of European and African ancestry. The findings of this analysis may advance understanding of the molecular genetic basis of SITB and provide evidence for ESR1, DRD2, TRAF3, and DCC as cross-ancestry candidate risk genes.

Our study assessed two aspects of the MVP: (i) longitudinal changes in population diversity and (ii) how these changes can be accounted for in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To investigate these aspects, we divided MVP participants into five birth cohorts (N-range = 123,888 [born from 1943 to 1947] to 136,699 [born from 1948 to 1953]). Ancestry groups were defined by (i) HARE (harmonized ancestry and race/ethnicity) and (ii) a random-forest clustering approach using the 1000 Genomes Project and the Human Genome Diversity Project (1kGP + HGDP) reference panels (77 world populations representing six continental groups). In these groups, we performed GWASs of height, a trait potentially affected by population stratification. Birth cohorts demonstrate important trends in ancestry diversity over time. More recent HARE-assigned Europeans, Africans, and Hispanics had lower European ancestry proportions than older birth cohorts (0.010 < Cohen's d < 0.259, p < 7.80 × 10 This study provides a characterization of ancestry diversity of the MVP cohort over time and compares two strategies to infer genetically defined ancestry groups by assessing differences in controlling population stratification in genome-wide association studies.",Human genomics,2023,"Humans; Ethnicity; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Veterans; Racial Groups",False,1

Participants of this observational cross-sectional study (N = 9,646) were post-deployed Iraq-/Afghanistan-era veterans enrolled in the VA's Million Veteran Program with a clinician-confirmed history of TBI on the Comprehensive TBI Evaluation (CTBIE). Racial/ethnic groups included White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Multiracial, Another Race, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Dependent variables included neurobehavioral symptom domains and symptom validity assessed via the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) and Validity-10, respectively. Chi-square analyses showed significant racial/ethnic group differences for vestibular, somatic/sensory, and affective symptoms as well as for all Validity-10 cutoff scores examined (≥33, ≥27, ≥26, >22, ≥22, ≥13, and ≥7). Follow-up analyses compared all racial/ethnic groups to one another, adjusting for sociodemographic- and injury-related characteristics. These analyses revealed that the affective symptom domain and the Validity-10 cutoff of ≥13 revealed the greatest number of racial/ethnic differences. Results showed significant racial/ethnic group differences on neurobehavioral symptom domains and symptom validity testing among veterans who completed the CTBIE. An enhanced understanding of how symptoms vary by race/ethnicity is vital so that clinical care can be appropriately tailored to the unique needs of all veterans. Results highlight the importance of establishing measurement invariance of the NSI across race/ethnicity and underscore the need for ongoing research to determine the most appropriate Validity-10 cutoff score(s) to use across racially/ethnically diverse veterans.",Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists,2023,"Humans; Veterans; Neuropsychological Tests; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Ethnicity; Hispanic or Latino",False,7

We evaluated whether a polygenic hazard score based on 290 genetic variants (PHS290) is associated with prostate cancer risk in a diverse population, including Black men, who have higher average risk of prostate cancer death but are often treated as a homogeneously high-risk group. This was a retrospective analysis of the Million Veteran Program, a national, population-based cohort study of US military veterans conducted 2011-2021. Cox proportional hazards analyses tested for association of genetic and other risk factors (including self-reported race and ethnicity and family history) with age at death from prostate cancer, age at diagnosis of metastatic (nodal or distant) prostate cancer, and age at diagnosis of any prostate cancer. A total of 590 750 male participants were included. Median age at last follow-up was 69 years. PHS290 was associated with fatal prostate cancer in the full cohort and for each racial and ethnic group (P < .001). Comparing men in the highest 20% of PHS290 with those in the lowest 20% (based on percentiles from an independent training cohort), the hazard ratio for fatal prostate cancer was 4.42 (95% confidence interval = 3.91 to 5.02). When accounting for guideline-recommended risk factors (family history, race, and ethnicity), PHS290 remained a strong independent predictor of any, metastatic, and fatal prostate cancer. PHS290 stratified US veterans of diverse ancestry for lifetime risk of prostate cancer, including metastatic and fatal cancer.

Furthermore, it is unclear whether primarily drinking beer, wine, or liquor is associated with a difference in stroke risk. The study included 185,323 Million Veteran Program participants who self-reported alcohol consumption on the Lifestyle Survey. Moderate consumption was defined as 1-2 drinks/day and beverage preference of beer, wine or liquor was defined if ≥ 50% of total drinks consumed were from a single type of beverage. Strokes were defined using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes from the participants' electronic health record. The mean (sd) age of the sample was 64 (13) years and 11% were women. We observed 4,339 (94% ischemic; 6% hemorrhagic) strokes over a median follow-up of 5.2 years. In Cox models adjusted for age, sex, race, education, income, body mass index, smoking, exercise, diet, cholesterol, prevalent diabetes, prevalent hypertension, lipid-lowering medication, antihypertensive medication, and diabetes medication, moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 drinks/day) was associated with a 22% lower risk of total stroke compared with never drinking [Hazards ratio (HR) 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.78 (0.67, 0.92)]. When stratifying by stroke type, we observed a similar protective association with moderate consumption and ischemic stroke [HR (95% CI): 0.76 (0.65, 0.90)], but a non-statistically significant higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke [HR (95% CI): 1.29 (0.64, 2.61)]. We did not observe a difference in ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke risk among those who preferred beer, liquor or wine vs. no beverage preference. When stratifying by prior number of hospital visits (≤ 15, 16-33, 34-64, ≥ 65) as a proxy for health status, we observed attenuation of the protective association with greater number of visits [HR (95% CI): 0.87 (0.63, 1.19) for ≥ 65 visits vs. 0.80 (0.59, 1.08) for ≤ 15 visits]. We observed a lower risk of ischemic stroke, but not hemorrhagic stroke with moderate alcohol consumption and did not observe substantial differences in risk by beverage preference among a sample of U.S. Veterans.

Million Veteran Program,37358378,Exploring Interactions Between Traumatic Brain Injury History and Gender on Medical Comorbidities in Military Veterans: An Epidemiological Analysis in the VA Million Veteran Program.,"Epidemiological studies of medical comorbidities and possible gender differences associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are limited, especially among military veterans. The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between TBI history and a wide range of medical conditions in a large, national sample of veterans, and to explore interactions with gender. Participants of this cross-sectional epidemiological study included 491,604 veterans (9.9% TBI cases; 8.3% women) who enrolled in the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP). Outcomes of interest were medical comorbidities (i.e., neurological, mental health, circulatory, and other medical conditions) assessed using the MVP Baseline Survey, a self-report questionnaire. Logistic regression models adjusting for age and gender showed that veterans with TBI history consistently had significantly higher rates of medical comorbidities than controls, with the greatest differences observed across mental health (odds ratios [ORs] = 2.10-3.61) and neurological (ORs = 1.57-6.08) conditions. Similar patterns were found when evaluating men and women separately. Additionally, significant TBI-by-gender interactions were observed, particularly for mental health and neurological comorbidities, such that men with a history of TBI had greater odds of having several of these conditions than women with a history of TBI. These findings highlight the array of medical comorbidities experienced by veterans with a history of TBI, and illustrate that clinical outcomes differ for men and women with TBI history. Although these results are clinically informative, more research is needed to better understand the role of gender on health conditions in the context of TBI and how gender interacts with other social and cultural factors to influence clinical trajectories following TBI. Ultimately, understanding the biological, psychological, and social mechanisms underlying these comorbidities may help with tailoring TBI treatment by gender and improve quality of life for veterans with TBI history.",Journal of neurotrauma,2024,"Male; Humans; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Quality of Life; Veterans; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Comorbidity",False,2
Million Veteran Program,36940203,Genome-wide association study identifies four pan-ancestry loci for suicidal ideation in the Million Veteran Program.,"Suicidal ideation (SI) often precedes and predicts suicide attempt and death, is the most common suicidal phenotype and is over-represented in veterans. The genetic architecture of SI in the absence of suicide attempt (SA) is unknown, yet believed to have distinct and overlapping risk with other suicidal behaviors. We performed the first GWAS of SI without SA in the Million Veteran Program (MVP), identifying 99,814 SI cases from electronic health records without a history of SA or suicide death (SD) and 512,567 controls without SI, SA or SD. GWAS was performed separately in the four largest ancestry groups, controlling for sex, age and genetic substructure. Ancestry-specific results were combined via meta-analysis to identify pan-ancestry loci. Four genome-wide significant (GWS) loci were identified in the pan-ancestry meta-analysis with loci on chromosomes 6 and 9 associated with suicide attempt in an independent sample. Pan-ancestry gene-based analysis identified GWS associations with DRD2, DCC, FBXL19, BCL7C, CTF1, ANNK1, and EXD3. Gene-set analysis implicated synaptic and startle response pathways (q's<0.05). European ancestry (EA) analysis identified GWS loci on chromosomes 6 and 9, as well as GWS gene associations in EXD3, DRD2, and DCC. No other ancestry-specific GWS results were identified, underscoring the need to increase representation of diverse individuals. The genetic correlation of SI and SA within MVP was high (rG = 0.87; p = 1.09e-50), as well as with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; rG = 0.78; p = 1.98e-95) and major depressive disorder (MDD; rG = 0.78; p = 8.33e-83). Conditional analysis on PTSD and MDD attenuated most pan-ancestry and EA GWS signals for SI without SA to nominal significance, with the exception of EXD3 which remained GWS. Our novel findings support a polygenic and complex architecture for SI without SA which is largely shared with SA and overlaps with psychiatric conditions frequently comorbid with suicidal behaviors.",PLoS genetics,2023,"Humans; Suicidal Ideation; Veterans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Depressive Disorder, Major; Suicide, Attempted; Risk Factors",False,9
Million Veteran Program,37132202,Racial and Ethnic Bias in the Diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder in Veterans.,"Studies show that racially and ethnically minoritized veterans have a higher prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) than White veterans. The investigators examined whether the relationship between self-reported race and ethnicity and AUD diagnosis remains after adjusting for alcohol consumption, and if so, whether it varies by self-reported alcohol consumption. The sample included 700,012 Black, White, and Hispanic veterans enrolled in the Million Veteran Program. Alcohol consumption was defined as an individual's maximum score on the consumption subscale of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C), a screen for unhealthy alcohol use. A diagnosis of AUD, the primary outcome, was defined by the presence of relevant ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes in electronic health records. Logistic regression with interactions was used to assess the association between race and ethnicity and AUD as a function of maximum AUDIT-C score. Black and Hispanic veterans were more likely than White veterans to have an AUD diagnosis despite similar levels of alcohol consumption. The difference was greatest between Black and White men; at all but the lowest and highest levels of alcohol consumption, Black men had 23%-109% greater odds of an AUD diagnosis. The findings were unchanged after adjustment for alcohol consumption, alcohol-related disorders, and other potential confounders. The large discrepancy in the prevalence of AUD across groups despite a similar distribution of alcohol consumption levels suggests that there is racial and ethnic bias, with Black and Hispanic veterans more likely than White veterans to receive an AUD diagnosis.

Million Veteran Program,37353210,Dietary ω-3 fatty acids and the incidence of atrial fibrillation in the Million Veteran Program.,"Although recent large randomized clinical trials have reported an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) with marine ω-3 fatty acid supplements, it is unclear whether dietary marine ω-3 fatty acids assessed through food frequency questionnaires are associated with AF risk. We sought to test the hypothesis that dietary eicosapentaenoic acid/docosahexaenoic acid/docosapentaecnoic acid (EPA/DHA/DPA) is associated with a higher risk of AF in a large prospective cohort of US Veterans. We analyzed data from Million Veteran Program participants who completed self-reported food frequency questionnaires. We used multivariable Cox regression to estimate the HRs of AF across quintiles of ω-3 fatty acid consumption and a cubic spline analysis to assess the dose-response relations between ω-3 fatty acids and AF. Of the 301,294 veterans studied, the median intake of ω-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA/DPA) was 219 mg/d (IQR: 144-575), and the mean age was 64.9 y (SD: 12.0); 91% were men, and 84% were White. Consumption of EPA/DHA/DPA exhibited a nonlinear inverse relation with incident AF characterized by an initial decline to 11% at 750 mg/d of marine ω-3 fatty acid intake followed by a plateau.

Genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are proposed to improve ASCVD risk estimation. To determine whether genome-wide PRSs for coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute ischemic stroke improve ASCVD risk estimation with traditional clinical risk factors in an ancestrally diverse midlife population. This was a prognostic analysis of incident events in a retrospectively defined longitudinal cohort conducted from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2018. Included in the study were adults free of ASCVD and statin naive at baseline from the Million Veteran Program (MVP), a mega biobank with genetic, survey, and electronic health record data from a large US health care system. Data were analyzed from March 15, 2021, to January 5, 2023. PRSs for CAD and ischemic stroke derived from cohorts of largely European descent and risk factors, including age, sex, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, smoking, and diabetes status. Incident nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, ASCVD death, and composite ASCVD events. A total of 79 151 participants (mean [SD] age, 57.8 [13.7] years; 68 503 male [86.5%]) were included in the study. The cohort included participants from the following harmonized genetic ancestry and race and ethnicity categories: 18 505 non-Hispanic Black (23.4%), 6785 Hispanic (8.6%), and 53 861 non-Hispanic White (68.0%) with a median (5th-95th percentile) follow-up of 4.3 (0.7-6.9) years. From 2011 to 2018, 3186 MIs (4.0%), 1933 ischemic strokes (2.4%), 867 ASCVD deaths (1.1%), and 5485 composite ASCVD events (6.9%) were observed. CAD PRS was associated with incident MI in non-Hispanic Black (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.19), Hispanic (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.46), and non-Hispanic White (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.18-1.29) participants. Stroke PRS was associated with incident stroke in non-Hispanic White participants (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.08-1.21). A combined CAD plus stroke PRS was associated with ASCVD deaths among non-Hispanic Black (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17) and non-Hispanic (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.21) participants. The combined PRS was also associated with composite ASCVD across all ancestry groups but greater among non-Hispanic White (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.16-1.24) than non-Hispanic Black (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.17) and Hispanic (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00-1.25) participants. Net reclassification improvement from adding PRS to a traditional risk model was modest for the intermediate risk group for composite CVD among men (5-year risk >3.75%, 0.38%; 95% CI, 0.07%-0.68%), among women, (6.79%; 95% CI, 3.01%-10.58%), for age older than 55 years (0.25%; 95% CI, 0.03%-0.47%), and for ages 40 to 55 years (1.61%; 95% CI, -0.07% to 3.30%).

Across 109 phenotypes (82 from the UK Biobank, 18 from the Million Veteran Program, and nine from the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium), LDAK-GBAT finds on average 19% (SE: 1%) more significant genes than the existing tool sumFREGAT-ACAT, with even greater gains in comparison with MAGMA, GCTA-fastBAT, sumFREGAT-SKAT-O, and sumFREGAT-PCA.",American journal of human genetics,2023,"Genome-Wide Association Study; Phenotype; Genetic Testing; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,1
Million Veteran Program,36989840,Genome-wide association study of obstructive sleep apnoea in the Million Veteran Program uncovers genetic heterogeneity by sex.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are limited due to the underdiagnosis of OSA, leading to misclassification of OSA, which consequently reduces statistical power. We performed a GWAS of OSA in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system, where OSA prevalence is close to its true population prevalence. We performed GWAS of 568,576 MVP participants, stratified by biological sex and by harmonized race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry (HARE) groups of White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian individuals. We considered both BMI adjusted (BMI-adj) and unadjusted (BMI-unadj) models. We replicated associations in independent datasets, and analysed the heterogeneity of OSA genetic associations across HARE and sex groups. We finally performed a larger meta-analysis GWAS of MVP, FinnGen, and the MGB Biobank, totalling 916,696 individuals. MVP participants are 91% male. OSA prevalence is 21%. In MVP there were 18 and 6 genome-wide significant loci in BMI-unadj and BMI-adj analyses, respectively, corresponding to 21 association regions. Of these, 17 were not previously reported in association with OSA, and 13 replicated in FinnGen (False Discovery Rate p-value < 0.05). There were widespread significant differences in genetic effects between men and women, but less so across HARE groups. Meta-analysis of MVP, FinnGen, and MGB biobank revealed 17 additional, previously unreported, genome-wide significant regions. Sex differences in genetic associations with OSA are widespread, likely associated with multiple OSA risk factors. OSA shares genetic underpinnings with several sleep phenotypes, suggesting shared aetiology and causal pathways.

This study from the Million Veteran Program (MVP) evaluated the impact of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4, PTSD, and TBI on ADRD prevalence in veteran cohorts of European ancestry (EA; n = 11,112 ADRD cases, 170,361 controls) and African ancestry (AA; n = 1443 ADRD cases, 16,191 controls). Additive-scale interactions were estimated using the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) statistic. PTSD, TBI, and APOE ε4 showed strong main-effect associations with ADRD. RERI analysis revealed significant additive APOE ε4 interactions with PTSD and TBI in the EA cohort and TBI in the AA cohort. These additive interactions indicate that ADRD prevalence associated with PTSD and TBI increased with the number of inherited APOE ε4 alleles. PTSD and TBI history will be an important part of interpreting the results of ADRD genetic testing and doing accurate ADRD risk assessment.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2023,"Humans; Veterans; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E4; Gene-Environment Interaction; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Aging",False,7
Million Veteran Program,37165447,Sex differences in the polygenic architecture of hearing problems in adults.,"Hearing problems (HP) in adults are common and are associated with several comorbid conditions. Its prevalence increases with age, reflecting the cumulative effect of environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Although several risk loci have been already identified, HP biology and epidemiology are still insufficiently investigated by large-scale genetic studies. Leveraging the UK Biobank, the Nurses' Health Studies (I and II), the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and the Million Veteran Program, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide investigation of HP in 748,668 adult participants (discovery N = 501,825; replication N = 226,043; cross-ancestry replication N = 20,800). We leveraged the GWAS findings to characterize HP polygenic architecture, exploring sex differences, polygenic risk across ancestries, tissue-specific transcriptomic regulation, cause-effect relationships with genetically correlated traits, and gene interactions with HP environmental risk factors. We identified 54 risk loci and demonstrated that HP polygenic risk is shared across ancestry groups. Our transcriptomic regulation analysis highlighted the potential role of the central nervous system in HP pathogenesis. The sex-stratified analyses showed several additional associations related to peripheral hormonally regulated tissues reflecting a potential role of estrogen in hearing function. This evidence was supported by the multivariate interaction analysis that showed how genes involved in brain development interact with sex, noise pollution, and tobacco smoking in relation to their HP associations. Additionally, the genetically informed causal inference analysis showed that HP is linked to many physical and mental health outcomes. The results provide many novel insights into the biology and epidemiology of HP in adults. Our sex-specific analyses and transcriptomic associations highlighted molecular pathways that may be targeted for drug development or repurposing. Additionally, the potential causal relationships identified may support novel preventive screening programs to identify individuals at risk.",Genome medicine,2023,Humans; Adult; Male; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Sex Characteristics; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Multifactorial Inheritance; Hearing; Genome-Wide Association Study,False,8
Million Veteran Program,36809323,Association of African Ancestry-Specific APOE Missense Variant R145C With Risk of Alzheimer Disease.,"Numerous studies have established the association of the common APOE ε2 and APOE ε4 alleles with Alzheimer disease (AD) risk across ancestries. Studies of the interaction of these alleles with other amino acid changes on APOE in non-European ancestries are lacking and may improve ancestry-specific risk prediction. To determine whether APOE amino acid changes specific to individuals of African ancestry modulate AD risk. Case-control study including 31 929 participants and using a sequenced discovery sample (Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project; stage 1) followed by 2 microarray imputed data sets derived from the Alzheimer Disease Genetic Consortium (stage 2, internal replication) and the Million Veteran Program (stage 3, external validation). This study combined case-control, family-based, population-based, and longitudinal AD cohorts, which recruited participants (1991-2022) in primarily US-based studies with 1 US/Nigerian study. Across all stages, individuals included in this study were of African ancestry. Two APOE missense variants (R145C and R150H) were assessed, stratified by APOE genotype. The primary outcome was AD case-control status, and secondary outcomes included age at AD onset. Stage 1 included 2888 cases (median age, 77 [IQR, 71-83] years; 31.3% male) and 4957 controls (median age, 77 [IQR, 71-83] years; 28.0% male). In stage 2, across multiple cohorts, 1201 cases (median age, 75 [IQR, 69-81] years; 30.8% male) and 2744 controls (median age, 80 [IQR, 75-84] years; 31.4% male) were included. In stage 3, 733 cases (median age, 79.4 [IQR, 73.8-86.5] years; 97.0% male) and 19 406 controls (median age, 71.9 [IQR, 68.4-75.8] years; 94.5% male) were included. In ε3/ε4-stratified analyses of stage 1, R145C was present in 52 individuals with AD (4.8%) and 19 controls (1.5%); R145C was associated with an increased risk of AD (odds ratio [OR], 3.01; 95% CI, 1.87-4.85; P = 6.0 × 10-6) and was associated with a reported younger age at AD onset (β, -5.87 years; 95% CI, -8.35 to -3.4 years; P = 3.4 × 10-6). Association with increased AD risk was replicated in stage 2 (R145C was present in 23 individuals with AD [4.7%] and 21 controls [2.7%]; OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.04-4.65; P = .04) and was concordant in stage 3 (R145C was present in 11 individuals with AD [3.8%] and 149 controls [2.7%]; OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 0.99-3.64; P = .051). Association with earlier AD onset was replicated in stage 2 (β, -5.23 years; 95% CI, -9.58 to -0.87 years; P = .02) and stage 3 (β, -10.15 years; 95% CI, -15.66 to -4.64 years; P = 4.0 × 10-4). No significant associations were observed in other APOE strata for R145C or in any APOE strata for R150H. In this exploratory analysis, the APOE ε3[R145C] missense variant was associated with an increased risk of AD among individuals of African ancestry with the ε3/ε4 genotype. With additional external validation, these findings may inform AD genetic risk assessment in individuals of African ancestry.",JAMA,2023,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Alleles; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E4; Apolipoproteins E; Black People; Case-Control Studies; Genotype; Risk Factors; Mutation, Missense",False,0
Million Veteran Program,37147289,Multi-trait genome-wide association analyses leveraging alcohol use disorder findings identify novel loci for smoking behaviors in the Million Veteran Program.,"Smoking behaviors and alcohol use disorder (AUD), both moderately heritable traits, commonly co-occur in the general population. Single-trait genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci for smoking and AUD. However, GWASs that have aimed to identify loci contributing to co-occurring smoking and AUD have used small samples and thus have not been highly informative. Applying multi-trait analysis of GWASs (MTAG), we conducted a joint GWAS of smoking and AUD with data from the Million Veteran Program (N = 318,694). By leveraging GWAS summary statistics for AUD, MTAG identified 21 genome-wide significant (GWS) loci associated with smoking initiation and 17 loci associated with smoking cessation compared to 16 and 8 loci, respectively, identified by single-trait GWAS. The novel loci for smoking behaviors identified by MTAG included those previously associated with psychiatric or substance use traits. Colocalization analysis identified 10 loci shared by AUD and smoking status traits, all of which achieved GWS in MTAG, including variants on SIX3, NCAM1, and near DRD2. Functional annotation of the MTAG variants highlighted biologically important regions on ZBTB20, DRD2, PPP6C, and GCKR that contribute to smoking behaviors. In contrast, MTAG of smoking behaviors and alcohol consumption (AC) did not enhance discovery compared with single-trait GWAS for smoking behaviors. We conclude that using MTAG to augment the power of GWAS enables the identification of novel genetic variants for commonly co-occuring phenotypes, providing new insights into their pleiotropic effects on smoking behavior and AUD.",Translational psychiatry,2023,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alcoholism; Veterans; Phenotype; Alcohol Drinking; Smoking; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Predisposition to Disease",False,1
Million Veteran Program,37562936,Bioinformatic platforms for clinical stratification of natural history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.,"Although bioinformatic methods gained a lot of attention in the latest years, their use in real-world studies for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) is still lacking. Bioinformatic resources have been applied to thousands of individuals from the Framingham Heart Study as well as health care-associated biobanks such as the UK Biobank, the Million Veteran Program, and the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium and randomized controlled trials (i.e. ODYSSEY, FOURIER, ASPREE, and PREDIMED). These studies contributed to the development of polygenic risk scores (PRS), which emerged as novel potent genetic-oriented tools, able to calculate the individual risk of ASCVD and to predict the individual response to therapies such as statins and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor. ASCVD are the first cause of death around the world including coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral artery disease, and stroke. To achieve the goal of precision medicine and personalized therapy, advanced bioinformatic platforms are set to link clinically useful indices to heterogeneous molecular data, mainly epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics. The DIANA study found that differential methylation of ABCA1, TCF7, PDGFA, and PRKCZ significantly discriminated patients with acute coronary syndrome from healthy subjects and their expression levels positively associated with CK-MB serum concentrations. The ARIC Study revealed several plasma proteins, acting or not in lipid metabolism, with a potential role in determining the different pleiotropic effects of statins in each subject. The implementation of molecular high-throughput studies and bioinformatic techniques into traditional cardiovascular risk prediction scores is emerging as a more accurate practice to stratify patients earlier in life and to favour timely and tailored risk reduction strategies. Of note, radiogenomics aims to combine imaging features extracted for instance by coronary computed tomography angiography and molecular biomarkers to create CHD diagnostic algorithms useful to characterize atherosclerotic lesions and myocardial abnormalities. The current view is that such platforms could be of clinical value for prevention, risk stratification, and treatment of ASCVD.",European heart journal.

Million Veteran Program,36540996,Diversity is key for cross-ancestry transferability of glaucoma genetic risk scores in Hispanic Veterans in the Million Veteran Program.,"A major goal of precision medicine is to stratify patients based on their genetic risk for a disease to inform future screening and intervention strategies. For conditions like primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the genetic risk architecture is complicated with multiple variants contributing small effects on risk. Following the tepid success of genome-wide association studies for high-effect disease risk variant discovery, genetic risk scores (GRS), which collate effects from multiple genetic variants into a single measure, have shown promise for disease risk stratification. We assessed the application of GRS for POAG risk stratification in Hispanic-descent (HIS) and European-descent (EUR) Veterans in the Million Veteran Program. Unweighted and cross-ancestry meta-weighted GRS were calculated based on 127 genomic variants identified in the most recent report of cross-ancestry POAG meta-analyses. We found that both GRS types were associated with POAG case-control status and performed similarly in HIS and EUR Veterans. This trend was also seen in our subset analysis of HIS Veterans with less than 50% EUR global genetic ancestry. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating GRS based on known POAG risk variants in different ancestry groups and emphasize the need for more multi-ancestry POAG genetic studies.",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

Previous case reports and case series suggest an association may exist between these diseases, as well as an increased risk of SLE after thymectomy for MG. We undertook this study to determine whether SLE and MG were associated in large cohorts. We searched the IBM Watson Health Explorys platform and the Department of Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program (MVP) database for diagnoses of SLE and MG. In addition, we examined subjects enrolled in the Lupus Family Registry and Repository (LFRR) as well as controls for a diagnosis of MG. Among 59,780,210 individuals captured in Explorys, there were 25,750 with MG and 65,370 with SLE. 370 subjects had both. Those with MG were >10 times more likely to have SLE than those without MG. Those with both diseases were more likely to be women, African American, and at a younger age than MG subjects without SLE. In addition, the MG patients who underwent thymectomy had an increased risk of SLE compared to MG patients who had not undergone thymectomy (OR 3.11, 95% CI: 2.12 to 4.55). Autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anemia and miscellaneous comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease were significantly more common in MG patients who developed SLE. In the MVP, SLE and MG were also significantly associated. Association of SLE and MG in a large SLE cohort with rigorous SLE classification confirmed the association of SLE with MG at a similar level. While the number of patients with both MG and SLE is small, SLE and MG are strongly associated together in very large databases and a large SLE cohort.","Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",2024,"Female; Humans; Male; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Myasthenia Gravis; Thymectomy",False,2
Million Veteran Program,37769328,Deep sequential neural network models improve stratification of suicide attempt risk among US veterans.,"To apply deep neural networks (DNNs) to longitudinal EHR data in order to predict suicide attempt risk among veterans. Local explainability techniques were used to provide explanations for each prediction with the goal of ultimately improving outreach and intervention efforts. The DNNs fused demographic information with diagnostic, prescription, and procedure codes. Models were trained and tested on EHR data of approximately 500 000 US veterans: all veterans with recorded suicide attempts from April 1, 2005, through January 1, 2016, each paired with 5 veterans of the same age who did not attempt suicide. Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values were calculated to provide explanations of DNN predictions. The DNNs outperformed logistic and linear regression models in predicting suicide attempts. After adjusting for the sampling technique, the convolutional neural network (CNN) model achieved a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.54 for suicide attempts within 12 months by veterans in the top 0.1% risk tier. Explainability methods identified meaningful subgroups of high-risk veterans as well as key determinants of suicide attempt risk at both the group and individual level. The deep learning methods employed in the present study have the potential to significantly enhance existing suicide risk models for veterans. These methods can also provide important clues to explore the relative value of long-term and short-term intervention strategies. Furthermore, the explainability methods utilized here could also be used to communicate to clinicians the key features which increase specific veterans' risk for attempting suicide.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2023,"Humans; Suicide, Attempted; Veterans; Neural Networks, Computer; Motivation",False,9

We developed a FECD case-control algorithm based on structured electronic health record data and confirmed accuracy by individual review of charts at 3 Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers. This algorithm was applied to the Department of VA Million Veteran Program cohort from whom sex, genetic ancestry, comorbidities, diagnostic phecodes, and laboratory values were extracted. Single-variable and multiple variable logistic regression models were used to determine the association of these risk factors with FECD diagnosis. Being a FECD case was associated with female sex, European genetic ancestry, and a greater number of comorbidities. Of 1417 diagnostic phecodes evaluated, 213 had a significant association with FECD, falling in both ocular and nonocular conditions, including diabetes mellitus (DM). Five of 69 laboratory values were associated with FECD, with the direction of change for 4 being consistent with DM. Insulin dependency and type 1 DM raised risk to a greater degree than type 2 DM, like other microvascular diabetic complications. Female sex, European ancestry, and multimorbidity increased FECD risk. Endocrine/metabolic clinic encounter codes and altered patterns of laboratory values support DM increasing FECD risk.

We performed a univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the causal relationship between blood lipids and female infertility. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with lipid traits in univariate analysis were obtained from the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC), involving up to 215,551 and 188,577 European individuals, respectively. Blood lipids in multivariate analysis were obtained from the latest genome-wide association study meta-analysis with lipid levels in 73 studies encompassing >300,000 participants.

Million Veteran Program,36540997,Predictive models for abdominal aortic aneurysms using polygenic scores and PheWAS-derived risk factors.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are common enlargements of the abdominal aorta which can grow larger until rupture, often leading to death. Detection of AAA is often by ultrasonography and screening recommendations are mostly directed at men over 65 with a smoking history. Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified genetic loci associated with AAA risk. We combined known risk factors, polygenic risk scores (PRS) and precedent clinical diagnoses from electronic health records (EHR) to develop predictive models for AAA, and compared performance against screening recommendations. The PRS included genome-wide summary statistics from the Million Veteran Program and FinnGen (10,467 cases, 378,713 controls of European ancestry), with optimization in Vanderbilt's BioVU and validated in the eMERGE Network, separately across both White and Black participants. Candidate diagnoses were identified through a temporally-oriented Phenome-wide association study in independent EHR data from Vanderbilt, and features were selected via elastic net. We calculated C-statistics in eMERGE for models including PRS, phecodes, and covariates using regression weights from BioVU. The AUC for the full model in the test set was 0.883 (95% CI 0.873-0.892), 0.844 (0.836-0.851) for covariates only, 0.613 (95% CI 0.604-0.622) when using primary USPSTF screening criteria, and 0.632 (95% CI 0.623-0.642) using primary and secondary criteria. Brier scores were between 0.003 and 0.023 for our models indicating good calibration, and net reclassification improvement over combined primary and secondary USPSTF criteria was 0.36-0.60.

This cross-sectional study examined a national sample of Veterans enrolled in the VA Million Veteran Program who completed the Comprehensive TBI Evaluation (CTBIE) as part of the Veterans Health Administration's TBI Screening and Evaluation Program. Veterans (N = 12,985) were classified into the following TBI/SCI groups using CTBIE data: those with a dual diagnosis of TBI and SCI (TBI+/SCI+); those with a history of TBI but no SCI (TBI+/SCI-); and those with no history of TBI or SCI (TBI-/SCI-; i.e., the control group). CTBIE-derived outcomes included neurobehavioral symptoms, comorbid psychiatric symptoms, pain and pain interference, and employment status. Chi-square analyses showed significant associations between TBI/SCI group and all clinical outcomes evaluated (all p's < .001; V = 0.07-0.11). In general, the TBI+/SCI+ and TBI +/SCI- groups endorsed comparable levels of neurobehavioral symptoms, psychiatric symptoms, and pain, but significantly greater rates of symptoms and pain relative to the TBI-/SCI- group. Effect sizes for all pairwise comparisons were small (φ = 0.01-0.11). Finally, there was no significant association between TBI/SCI group and employment status (p = .170; V = 0.02), with all three groups showing relatively comparable rates of unemployment. Regardless of SCI status, Veterans with TBI history endorsed poorer clinical outcomes than Veterans without TBI and SCI. However, rates of unemployment were similarly high across all three groups. Findings suggest that any Veteran completing the CTBIE may be at risk for poor clinical and employment outcomes.","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2024,"Humans; Veterans; Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry); Cross-Sectional Studies; Quality of Life; Employment; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Substance-Related Disorders; Pain; Spinal Cord Injuries",False,7

Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the relationship between fat intake and ASCVD risk were computed using Cox regression models. The mean age was 61 years, 88% were males. A total of 11,771 ASCVD events were identified during the follow-up. When compared with the lowest quintile, participants in the highest quintile of dietary trans-monounsaturated fats and conjugated linoleic acids had an increased risk (HR [95% CI]) of ASCVD events: 1.10 (1.04, 1.17) and 1.11 (1.05, 1.18), respectively. When compared with low consumers, participants in the highest quintile of total cis-polyunsaturated fatty acid intake had a lower risk of experiencing an ASCVD event 0.93 (0.87, 0.99). Although higher intakes of specific trans-fatty acids and conjugated linoleic were associated with an increased risk of ASCVD, the same cannot be said for all other fat classes. This work suggests that care must be taken when drawing general conclusions regarding the health effects of dietary individual fatty acids.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,2023,Male; Adult; Humans; United States; Middle Aged; Female; Cardiovascular Diseases; Prospective Studies; Veterans; Fatty Acids; Dietary Fats; Atherosclerosis; Trans Fatty Acids; Risk Factors,False,2
Million Veteran Program,37252880,"Genome-wide analyses reveal novel opioid use disorder loci and genetic overlap with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression.","Opioid use disorder (OUD) and mental disorders are often comorbid, with increased morbidity and mortality. The causes underlying this relationship are poorly understood. Although these conditions are highly heritable, their shared genetic vulnerabilities remain unaccounted for. We applied the conditional/conjunctional false discovery rate (cond/conjFDR) approach to analyse summary statistics from independent genome wide association studies of OUD, schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and major depression (MD) of European ancestry. Next, we characterized the identified shared loci using biological annotation resources. OUD data were obtained from the Million Veteran Program, Yale-Penn and Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE) (15 756 cases, 99 039 controls). SCZ (53 386 cases, 77 258 controls), BD (41 917 cases, 371 549 controls) and MD (170 756 cases, 329 443 controls) data were provided by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. We discovered genetic enrichment for OUD conditional on associations with SCZ, BD, MD and vice versa, indicating polygenic overlap with identification of 14 novel OUD loci at condFDR < 0.05 and 7 unique loci shared between OUD and SCZ (n = 2), BD (n = 2) and MD (n = 7) at conjFDR < 0.05 with concordant effect directions, in line with estimated positive genetic correlations. Two loci were novel for OUD, one for BD and one for MD. Three OUD risk loci were shared with more than one psychiatric disorder, at DRD2 on chromosome 11 (BD and MD), at FURIN on chromosome 15 (SCZ, BD and MD) and at the major histocompatibility complex region (SCZ and MD). Our findings provide new insights into the shared genetic architecture between OUD and SCZ, BD and MD, indicating a complex genetic relationship, suggesting overlapping neurobiological pathways.",Addiction biology,2023,"Humans; Bipolar Disorder; Depressive Disorder, Major; Genome-Wide Association Study; Schizophrenia; Depression; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Loci",False,9
Million Veteran Program,37642191,"Positive personality traits moderate persistent high alcohol consumption, determined by polygenic risk in U.S. military veterans: results from a 10-year, population-based, observational cohort study.","Understanding the interplay between psychosocial factors and polygenic risk scores (PRS) may help elucidate the biopsychosocial etiology of high alcohol consumption (HAC). This study examined the psychosocial moderators of HAC, determined by polygenic risk in a 10-year longitudinal study of US military veterans. We hypothesized that positive psychosocial traits (e.g. social support, personality traits, optimism, gratitude) may buffer risk of HAC in veterans with greater polygenic liability for alcohol consumption (AC). Data were analyzed from 1323 European-American US veterans who participated in the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a 10-year, nationally representative longitudinal study of US military veterans. PRS reflecting genome-wide risk for AC (AUDIT-C) was derived from a Million Veteran Program genome-wide association study ( Among the total sample, 328 (weighted 24.8%) had persistent HAC, 131 (weighted 9.9%) had new-onset HAC, 44 (weighted 3.3%) had remitted HAC, and 820 (weighted 62.0%) had no/low AC over the 10-year study period. AUDIT-C PRS was positively associated with persistent HAC relative to no/low AC [relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.23-1.67] and remitted HAC (RRR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.07-2.50). Among veterans with higher AUDIT-C PRS, greater baseline levels of agreeableness and greater dispositional gratitude were inversely associated with persistent HAC. AUDIT-C PRS was prospectively associated with persistent HAC over a 10-year period, and agreeableness and dispositional gratitude moderated this association. Clinical interventions designed to target these modifiable psychological traits may help mitigate risk of persistent HAC in veterans with greater polygenic liability for persistent HAC.",Psychological medicine,2023,Humans; Veterans; Longitudinal Studies; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alcohol Drinking; Cohort Studies; Genetic Risk Score; Personality,False,7
Million Veteran Program,37550530,Genome-wide analysis of a model-derived binge eating disorder phenotype identifies risk loci and implicates iron metabolism.,"Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder, yet its genetic architecture remains largely unknown. Studying BED is challenging because it is often comorbid with obesity, a common and highly polygenic trait, and it is underdiagnosed in biobank data sets. To address this limitation, we apply a supervised machine-learning approach (using 822 cases of individuals diagnosed with BED) to estimate the probability of each individual having BED based on electronic medical records from the Million Veteran Program. We perform a genome-wide association study of individuals of African (n = 77,574) and European (n = 285,138) ancestry while controlling for body mass index to identify three independent loci near the HFE, MCHR2 and LRP11 genes and suggest APOE as a risk gene for BED.

Studies indicate that 27-46% of the risk of age-related chronic imbalance is genetic; nevertheless, the underlying genes remain unknown. The cohort consisted of 50,339 cases and 366,900 controls in the Million Veteran Program. The phenotype comprised cases with two ICD diagnoses of vertigo or dizziness at least 6 months apart, excluding acute or recurrent vertiginous syndromes and other non-vestibular disorders.

Despite the elevated burden of HBP-induced cardiovascular diseases in Africa and other populations of African descent, limited genetic studies have been carried out to explore the genetic mechanism driving this phenomenon. We performed genome-wide association univariate and multivariate analyses of both systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) traits in 80,950 individuals of African ancestry.

Finally, we undertook a Bayesian fine-mapping analysis to identify potential causal variants. Our meta-analysis identified 10 independent variants associated with SBP and 9 with DBP traits. Whilst our multivariate GWAS method identified 21 independent signals, 18 of these SNPs have been previously identified. SBP was linked to gene sets involved in biological processes such as synapse assembly and cell-cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion.

Million Veteran Program,37282553,Genetic Underpinnings of the Transition From Alcohol Consumption to Alcohol Use Disorder: Shared and Unique Genetic Architectures in a Cross-Ancestry Sample.,"Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of alcohol-related phenotypes have uncovered key differences in the underlying genetic architectures of alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder (AUD), with the two traits having opposite genetic correlations with psychiatric disorders. Understanding the genetic factors that underlie the transition from heavy drinking to AUD has important theoretical and clinical implications. The authors used longitudinal data from the cross-ancestry Million Veteran Program sample to identify 1) novel loci associated with AUD and alcohol consumption (measured by the score on the consumption subscale of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT-C]), 2) the impact of phenotypic variation on genetic discovery, and 3) genetic variants with direct effects on AUD that are not mediated through alcohol consumption. The authors identified 26 loci associated with AUD and 22 loci associated with AUDIT-C score, including ancestry-specific and novel loci. In secondary GWASs that excluded individuals who report abstinence, the authors identified seven additional loci for AUD and eight additional loci for AUDIT-C score. Although the heterogeneity of the abstinent group biases the GWAS findings, unique variance between alcohol consumption and disorder remained after the abstinent group was excluded. Finally, using mediation analysis, the authors identified a set of variants with effects on AUD that are not mediated through alcohol consumption. Differences in genetic architecture between alcohol consumption and AUD are consistent with their having different biological contributions. Genetic variants with direct effects on AUD are potentially relevant to understanding the transition from heavy alcohol consumption to AUD and may be targets for translational prevention and treatment efforts.",The American journal of psychiatry,2023,Humans; Alcoholism; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alcohol Drinking; Phenotype; Veterans,False,1

This study aimed to explore whether NAFLD and cirrhosis were causally related to liver cancer using MR in European and East Asian populations. For European populations, NAFLD data were obtained from a genome-wide meta-analysis (8434 patients and 770 180 controls). The data on chronic elevation of alanine aminotransferase (cALT), a proxy of NAFLD, were derived from Million Veteran Program (68 725 patients and 95 472 controls). Cirrhosis data were collected from two sources: a genome-wide association study of five cohorts (4829 patients and 72 705 controls) and FinnGen (1931 patients and 216 861 controls). Liver cancer data were collected from FinnGen (304 patients and 174 006 controls). For East Asian populations, the data on cirrhosis (2184 patients and 210 269 controls) and hepatocellular carcinoma (1866 patients and 195 745 controls) were obtained from Biobank Japan. Three, 41, seven, six, and three single-nucleotide polymorphisms were used for NAFLD (European), cALT (European), cirrhosis (European-five cohorts), cirrhosis (European-FinnGen), and cirrhosis (East Asian), respectively. We used inverse-variance weighted as the primary method to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Among European populations, genetically-predicted NAFLD, cALT, cirrhosis (five cohorts), and cirrhosis (FinnGen) were positively associated with liver cancer, with ORs (95% CIs) of 6.62 (3.81-11.50) (p < .001), 2.59 (1.70-3.94) (p < .001), 3.38 (2.41-4.75) (p < .001), and 2.62 (1.20-5.72) (p = .015). Among East Asian populations, there was also a positive association between genetically-predicted cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.78-2.52; p < .001). This study utilized MR to complementarily confirm the positive connections of NAFLD and cirrhosis with liver cancer, as identified in earlier observational research.

Marked weight gain and loss could be associated with adverse biological processes. To evaluate the association between BMI variability and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in 2 distinct cohorts. This cohort study used data from the Million Veteran Program (MVP) between 2011 and 2018 and participants in the UK Biobank (UKB) enrolled between 2006 and 2010. Participants were followed up for a median of 3.8 (5th-95th percentile, 3.5) years. Participants with baseline CVD or cancer were excluded. Data were analyzed from September 2022 and September 2023. BMI variability was calculated by the retrospective SD and coefficient of variation (CV) using multiple clinical BMI measurements up to the baseline. The main outcome was incident composite CVD events (incident nonfatal myocardial infarction, acute ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death), assessed using Cox proportional hazards modeling after adjustment for CVD risk factors, including age, sex, mean BMI, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking status, diabetes status, and statin use. Secondary analysis assessed whether associations were dependent on the polygenic score of BMI. Among 92 363 US veterans in the MVP cohort (81 675 [88%] male; mean [SD] age, 56.7 [14.1] years), there were 9695 Hispanic participants, 22 488 non-Hispanic Black participants, and 60 180 non-Hispanic White participants. A total of 4811 composite CVD events were observed from 2011 to 2018. The CV of BMI was associated with 16% higher risk for composite CVD across all groups (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95% CI, 1.13-1.19). These associations were unchanged among subgroups and after adjustment for the polygenic score of BMI. The UKB cohort included 65 047 individuals (mean [SD] age, 57.30 (7.77) years; 38 065 [59%] female) and had 6934 composite CVD events. Each 1-SD increase in BMI variability in the UKB cohort was associated with 8% increased risk of cardiovascular death (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.11). This cohort study found that among US veterans, higher BMI variability was a significant risk marker associated with adverse cardiovascular events independent of mean BMI across major racial and ethnic groups. Results were consistent in the UKB for the cardiovascular death end point.

This study aimed to estimate mortality risk and longevity associated with individual lifestyle factors and comprehensive lifestyle therapy. Age- and sex-specific mortality rates were calculated on the basis of 719,147 veterans aged 40-99 y enrolled in the Veteran Affairs Million Veteran Program (2011-2019). Hazard ratios and estimated increase in life expectancy were examined among a subgroup of 276,132 veterans with complete data on 8 lifestyle factors at baseline. The 8 lifestyle factors included never smoking, physical activity, no excessive alcohol consumption, restorative sleep, nutrition, stress management, social connections, and no opioid use disorder. On the basis of 1.12 million person-years of follow-up, 34,247 deaths were recorded. Among veterans who adopted 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 lifestyle factors, the adjusted hazard ratios for mortality were 0.74 (0.60-0.90), 0.60 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.73), 0.50 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.61), 0.43 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.52), 0.35 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.43), 0.27 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.33), 0.21 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.26), and 0.13 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.16), respectively, as compared with veterans with no adopted lifestyle factors. The estimated life expectancy at age 40 y was 23.0, 26.5, 28.8, 30.8, 32.7, 35.1, 38.3, 41.3, and 47.0 y among males and 27.0, 28.8, 33.1, 38.0, 39.2, 41.4, 43.8, 46.3, and 47.5 y for females who adopted 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 lifestyle factors, respectively. The difference in life expectancy at age 40 y was 24.0 y for male veterans and 20.5 y for female veterans when comparing adoption of 8-9 lifestyle factors.

To determine the feasibility and outcomes of returning medically actionable genetic results to MVP participants, the program launched the MVP Return of Actionable Results (MVP-ROAR) Study, with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) as an exemplar actionable condition. The MVP-ROAR Study consists of a completed single-arm pilot phase and an ongoing randomized clinical trial (RCT), in which MVP participants are recontacted and invited to receive clinical confirmatory gene sequencing testing and a telegenetic counseling intervention. The primary outcome of the RCT is 6-month change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) between participants receiving results at baseline and those receiving results after 6 months. The pilot developed processes to identify and recontact participants nationally with probable pathogenic variants in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on the MVP genotype array, invite them to clinical confirmatory gene sequencing, and deliver a telegenetic counseling intervention. Among participants in the pilot phase, 8 (100%) had active statin prescriptions after 6 months. Results were shared with 16 first-degree family members. Six-month ΔLDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) after the genetic counseling intervention was -37 mg/dL (95% CI: -12 to -61; P = .03). The ongoing RCT will determine between-arm differences in this primary outcome. While underscoring the importance of clinical confirmation of research results, the pilot phase of the MVP-ROAR Study marks a turning point in MVP and demonstrates the feasibility of returning genetic results to participants and their providers.

Million Veteran Program,39250132,Role of the X Chromosome in Alzheimer Disease Genetics.,"The X chromosome has remained enigmatic in Alzheimer disease (AD), yet it makes up 5% of the genome and carries a high proportion of genes expressed in the brain, making it particularly appealing as a potential source of unexplored genetic variation in AD. To perform the first large-scale X chromosome-wide association study (XWAS) of AD. This was a meta-analysis of genetic association studies in case-control, family-based, population-based, and longitudinal AD-related cohorts from the US Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium, the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project, the UK Biobank, the Finnish health registry, and the US Million Veterans Program. Risk of AD was evaluated through case-control logistic regression analyses. Data were analyzed between January 2023 and March 2024. Genetic data available from high-density single-nucleotide variant microarrays and whole-genome sequencing and summary statistics for multitissue expression and protein quantitative trait loci available from published studies were included, enabling follow-up genetic colocalization analyses. A total of 1 629 863 eligible participants were selected from referred and volunteer samples, 477 596 of whom were excluded for analysis exclusion criteria. The number of participants who declined to participate in original studies was not available. Risk of AD, reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Associations were considered at X chromosome-wide (P < 1 × 10-5) and genome-wide (P < 5 × 10-8) significance. Primary analyses are nonstratified, while secondary analyses evaluate sex-stratified effects. Analyses included 1 152 284 participants of non-Hispanic White, European ancestry (664 403 [57.7%] female and 487 881 [42.3%] male), including 138 558 individuals with AD. Six independent genetic loci passed X chromosome-wide significance, with 4 showing support for links between the genetic signal for AD and expression of nearby genes in brain and nonbrain tissues. One of these 4 loci passed conservative genome-wide significance, with its lead variant centered on an intron of SLC9A7 (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04) and colocalization analyses prioritizing both the SLC9A7 and nearby CHST7 genes. Of these 6 loci, 4 displayed evidence for escape from X chromosome inactivation with regard to AD risk. This large-scale XWAS of AD identified the novel SLC9A7 locus. SLC9A7 regulates pH homeostasis in Golgi secretory compartments and is anticipated to have downstream effects on amyloid β accumulation. Overall, this study advances our knowledge of AD genetics and may provide novel biological drug targets. The results further provide initial insights into elucidating the role of the X chromosome in sex-based differences in AD.",JAMA neurology,2024,"Female; Humans; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Case-Control Studies; Chromosomes, Human, X; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Association Studies",False,2

This was a longitudinal cohort study using data from the Million Veteran Program (MVP; 2011-2020), UK Biobank (2006-2010), and 6 Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trials, including DECLARE-TIMI 58 (2013-2018), FOURIER (TIMI 59; 2013-2017), PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (2010-2014), SAVOR-TIMI 53 (2010-2013), SOLID-TIMI 52 (2009-2014), and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (2008-2013), which were a mix of population-based and randomized clinical trials. Individuals from UK Biobank and the MVP meeting a previously validated case/control definition for aortic stenosis were included. All individuals from TIMI trials were included unless they had a documented preexisting aortic valve replacement. Analysis took place from January 2022 to December 2023. PRS for aortic stenosis (developed using data from MVP and validated in UK Biobank) and other previously validated cardiovascular PRSs, defined either as a continuous variable or as low (bottom 20%), intermediate, and high (top 20%), and clinical risk factors. Aortic stenosis (defined using International Classification of Diseases or Current Procedural Terminology codes in UK Biobank and MVP or safety event data in the TIMI trials). The median (IQR) age in MVP was 67 (57-73) years, and 135 140 of 147 104 participants (92%) were male. The median (IQR) age in the TIMI trials was 66 (54-78) years, and 45 524 of 59 866 participants (71%) were male. The best aortic stenosis PRS incorporated 5 170 041 single-nucleotide variants and was associated with aortic stenosis in both the MVP testing sample (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.37-1.45 per 1 SD PRS; P = 4.6 × 10-116) and TIMI trials (hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.27-1.62 per 1 SD PRS; P = 3.2 × 10-9). Among genetic and clinical risk factors, the aortic stenosis PRS performed comparably to most risk factors besides age, and within a given age range, the combination of clinical and genetic risk factors was additive, providing a 3- to 4-fold increased gradient of risk of aortic stenosis. However, the addition of the aortic stenosis PRS to a model including clinical risk factors only improved risk discrimination of aortic stenosis by 0.01 to 0.02 (C index in MVP: 0.78 with clinical risk factors, 0.79 with risk factors and aortic stenosis PRS; C index in TIMI: 0.71 with clinical risk factors, 0.73 with risk factors and aortic stenosis PRS). This study developed and validated 1 of the first aortic stenosis PRSs. While aortic stenosis genetic risk was independent from clinical risk factors and performed comparably to all other risk factors besides age, genetic risk resulted in only a small improvement in overall aortic stenosis risk discrimination beyond age and clinical risk factors.

We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for POAG in 11,275 individuals of African ancestry (6,003 cases; 5,272 controls). We detected 46 risk loci associated with POAG at genome-wide significance. Replication and post-GWAS analyses, including functionally informed fine-mapping, multiple trait co-localization, and in silico validation, implicated two previously undescribed variants (rs1666698 mapping to DBF4P2; rs34957764 mapping to ROCK1P1) and one previously associated variant (rs11824032 mapping to ARHGEF12) as likely causal. For individuals of African ancestry, a polygenic risk score (PRS) for POAG from our mega-analysis (African ancestry individuals) outperformed a PRS from summary statistics of a much larger GWAS derived from European ancestry individuals.

Using data from 12 cohorts, including 18,265 cases with cirrhosis, 1,782,047 controls, up to 1 million individuals with liver function tests and a validation cohort of 21,689 cases and 617,729 controls, we identify and validate 14 risk associations for cirrhosis. Many variants are located near genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. One of these, PNPLA3 p.Ile148Met, interacts with alcohol intake, obesity and diabetes on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We develop a polygenic risk score that associates with the progression from cirrhosis to HCC. By focusing on prioritized genes from common variant analyses, we find that rare coding variants in GPAM associate with lower ALT, supporting GPAM as a potential target for therapeutic inhibition.

Characteristics typically associated with T1D were assessed in 109,594 Million Veteran Program participants with adult-onset diabetes, 2011-2021, who had T1D genetic risk scores (GRS) defined as low (0 to <45%), medium (45 to <90%), high (90 to <95%), or highest (≥95%). T1D characteristics increased progressively with higher genetic risk (P < 0.001 for trend). A GRS ≥90% was more common with diabetes diagnoses before age 40 years, but 95% of those participants were diagnosed at age ≥40 years, and their characteristics resembled those of individuals with T2D in mean age (64.3 years) and BMI (32.3 kg/m2). Compared with the low-risk group, the highest-risk group was more likely to have diabetic ketoacidosis (low GRS 0.9% vs. highest GRS 3.7%), hypoglycemia prompting emergency visits (3.7% vs. 5.8%), outpatient plasma glucose <50 mg/dL (7.5% vs. 13.4%), a shorter median time to start insulin (3.5 vs. 1.4 years), use of a T1D diagnostic code (16.3% vs. 28.1%), low C-peptide levels if tested (1.8% vs. 32.4%), and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (6.9% vs. 45.2%), all P < 0.001.

Here, we perform a large-scale genome-wide association study and multitrait analysis for DCM using 9,365 cases and 946,368 controls. We identify 70 genome-wide significant loci, which show broad replication in independent samples and map to 63 prioritized genes. Tissue, cell type and pathway enrichment analyses highlight the central role of the cardiomyocyte and contractile apparatus in DCM pathogenesis. Polygenic risk scores constructed from our genome-wide association study predict DCM across different ancestry groups, show differing contributions to DCM depending on rare pathogenic variant status and associate with systolic heart failure across various clinical settings. Mendelian randomization analyses reveal actionable potential causes of DCM, including higher bodyweight and higher systolic blood pressure.

However, knowledge about these sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA) conditions has been derived from studies in the less than 15% of patients who are clinically diagnosed and also lack diversity in age and genetic ancestry. To determine the prevalence of clinically diagnosed and undiagnosed X or Y chromosome aneuploidy among men enrolled in the Million Veteran Program (MVP); to describe military service metrics of men with SCAs; and to compare morbidity and mortality outcomes between men with SCA with and without a clinical diagnosis vs matched controls. This cross-sectional study used a case-control recruitment design to select biological males enrolled in the MVP biobank in the US Veterans Administration health care system from 2011 to 2022. Cases were participants with 47,XXY syndrome or 47,XYY syndrome, matched 1:5 with controls based on sex, age, and genetic ancestry. Data were analyzed from January 2022 to December 2023. Genomic identification of an additional X or Y chromosome. Outcomes of interest included prevalence of men with SCAs from genomic analysis; clinical SCA diagnosis; Charlson Comorbidity Index; rates of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency encounters per year; self-reported health outcomes; and standardized mortality ratio. Of 595 612 genotyped males in the MVP, 862 had an additional X chromosome (47,XXY) and 747 had an extra Y chromosome (47,XYY), with the highest prevalence among men with East Asian (47,XXY: 10 of 7313 participants; 47,XYY: 14 of 7313 participants) and European (47,XXY: 725 of 427 143 participants; 47,XYY: 625 of 427 143 participants) ancestry. Mean (SD) age at assessment was 61 (12) years, at which point 636 veterans (74.X%) with 47,XXY and 745 veterans (99%) with 47,XYY remained undiagnosed. Individuals with 47,XXY and 47,XYY had similar military service history, all-cause standardized mortality ratio, and age of death compared with matched controls. Individuals with SCA, compared with controls, had higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (47,XXY: mean [SD], 4.30 [2.72] vs controls: mean [SD], 3.90 [2.47]; 47,XYY: mean [SD], 4.45 [2.90] vs controls: mean [SD], 3.82 [2.50]) and health care utilization (eg, median [IQR] outpatient encounters per year: 47,XXY, 22.6 [11.8-37.8] vs controls, 16.8 [9.4-28]; 47,XYY: 21.4 [12.4-33.8] vs controls: 17.0 [9.4-28.2]), while several measures of HRQOL were lower (eg, mean [SD] self-reported physical function: 47,XXY: 34.2 [12] vs control mean [SD] 37.8 [12.8]; 47,XYY: 36.3 [11.6] vs control 37.9 [12.8]).

We sought to determine the health system-wide survival impact of ICIs. We identified all patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 inhibitors from 2010 to 2023 in the national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system (ICI cohort) and all patients who received non-ICI systemic therapy in the years before ICI approval (historical control). ICI and historical control cohorts were matched on multiple cancer-related prognostic factors, comorbidities, and demographics. The effect of ICI on overall survival was quantified with Cox regression incorporating matching weights. Cumulative life-years gained system-wide were calculated from the difference in adjusted 5-year restricted mean survival times. There were 27,322 patients in the ICI cohort and 69,801 patients in the historical control cohort. Among ICI patients, the most common cancer types were NSCLC (46%) and melanoma (10%). ICI demonstrated a large OS benefit in most cancer types with heterogeneity across cancer types (NSCLC: adjusted HR [aHR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-0.58, p < 0.001; urothelial: aHR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-1.01, p = 0.066). The relative benefit of ICI was stable across patient age, comorbidity, and self-reported race subgroups. Across VHA, 15,859 life-years gained were attributable to ICI within 5-years of treatment, with NSCLC contributing the most life-years gained.

Here, we assess whether presumed Agent Orange exposure is independently associated with increased risk of any metastatic or fatal PCa in a diverse Veteran cohort still alive in the modern era (at least 2011), when accounting for race/ethnicity, family history, and genetic risk. Participants in the Million Veteran Program (MVP; enrollment began in 2011) who were on active duty during the Vietnam War era (August 1964-April 1975) were included (n = 301,470). Agent Orange exposure was determined using the US government definition. Genetic risk was assessed via a validated polygenic hazard score. Associations with age at diagnosis of any PCa, metastatic PCa, and death from PCa were assessed via Cox proportional hazards models. On univariable analysis, exposure to Agent Orange was not associated with increased PCa (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.04, p = 0.06), metastatic PCa (HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.91-1.05, p = 0.55), or fatal PCa (HR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.79-1.09, p = 0.41). When accounting for race/ethnicity and family history, Agent Orange exposure was independently associated with slightly increased risk of PCa (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.04-1.09, <10-6) but not with metastatic PCa (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.98-1.15, p = 0.10) or PCa death (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.83-1.23, p = 0.09).

Our study included 148,506 participants [17,804 female (12.0%)] who were free of cancer, diabetes, and CVD at baseline from the Million Veteran Program. A food frequency questionnaire measured red meat intakes at baseline. Nonfatal myocardial infarction and acute ischemic stroke were identified through a high-throughput phenotyping algorithm, and fatal CVD events were identified by searching the National Death Index. Comparing the extreme categories of intake, the multivariate-adjusted relative risks of CVD was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.38; P-trend < 0.0001) for total red meat, 1.14 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.36; P-trend = 0.01) for unprocessed red meat, and 1.29 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.60; P-trend = 0.003) for processed red meat. We observed a more pronounced positive association between red meat intake and CVD in African American participants than in White participants (P-interaction = 0.01). Replacing 0.5 servings/d of red meat with 0.5 servings/d of nuts, whole grains, and skimmed milk was associated with 14% (RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.90), 7% (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.96), and 4% (RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.99) lower risks of CVD, respectively.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Studies Program #2006 ""Genomics of Gulf War Illness in Veterans"" project was established to address important questions concerning pathobiological and genetic aspects of GWI. The current study evaluated patterns of chronic ill health/GWI in the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP) Gulf War veteran cohort in relation to wartime exposures and key features of deployment, 27-30 years after Gulf War service. MVP participants who served in the 1990-1991 Gulf War completed the MVP Gulf War Era Survey in 2018-2020. Survey responses provided detailed information on veterans' health, Gulf War exposures, and deployment time periods and locations. Analyses determined associations of three defined GWI/ill health outcomes with Gulf War deployment characteristics and exposures. The final cohort included 14,103 veterans; demographic and military characteristics of the sample were similar to the full population of U.S. 1990-1991 Gulf War veterans. Overall, a substantial number of veterans experienced chronic ill health, as indicated by three defined outcomes: 49% reported their health as fair or poor, 31% met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for severe GWI, and 20% had been diagnosed with GWI by a healthcare provider. Health outcomes varied consistently with veterans' demographic and military characteristics, and with exposures during deployment. All outcomes were most prevalent among youngest veterans (< 50 years), Army and Marine Corps veterans, enlisted personnel (vs. officers), veterans located in Iraq and/or Kuwait for at least 7 days, and veterans who remained in theater from January/February 1991 through the summer of 1991. In multivariable models, GWI/ill health was most strongly associated with three exposures: chemical/biological warfare agents, taking pyridostigmine bromide pills, and use of skin pesticides. Results from this large cohort indicate that GWI/chronic ill health continues to affect a large proportion of Gulf War veterans in patterns associated with 1990-1991 Gulf War deployment and exposures.

Whether in person or automated frailty tools are ideal for identifying CVD risk remains unclear. We calculated 3 distinct frailty scores and examined their associations with mortality and CVD events in the Million Veteran Program, a prospective cohort of nearly 1 million US veterans. Veterans aged ≥50 years and enrolled from 2011 to 2018 were included. Two frailty indices (FI) based on the deficit accumulation theory were calculated: the questionnaire-based 36-item Million Veteran Program-FI and 31-item Veterans Affairs-FI using claims data. We calculated Fried physical frailty using the self-reported, 3-item Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. Multivariable-adjusted Cox models examined the association of frailty by each score with primary (all-cause and CVD mortality) and secondary (myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure) outcomes. In 190 688 veterans (69±9 years, 94% male, 85% White), 33, 233 (17%) all-cause and 10 115 (5%) CVD deaths occurred. Using Million Veteran Program-FI, 29% were robust, 42% pre-frail, and 29% frail. Frailty prevalence increased by age group (27% in 50-59 to 42% in ≥90 years). Using the Million Veteran Program-FI, over 6±2 years, frail veterans had a higher hazard of all-cause (hazard ratio [HR], 3.05 [95% CI, 2.95-3.16]) and CVD mortality (HR, 3.65 [95% CI, 3.43-3.90]). Findings were concordant for the Veterans Affairs-FI and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures frailty definitions, and remained significant even among younger veterans aged 50-59 years.

This was a prospective cohort study of US veterans enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Million Veteran Program (MVP) between 2011 and 2022. Data were analyzed from 2023 to 2024. LE8 score ranged from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating better cardiovascular health. The primary outcome was total ASCVD incidence in veterans without baseline ASCVD, and the secondary outcome was incidence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) among veterans with and without ASCVD at baseline. A total of 413 052 veterans (mean [SD] age, 65.8 [12.1] years; 378 162 [91.6%] male) were included. Based on 1.7 million person-years of follow-up of 279 868 veterans without any ASCVD at baseline, 45 067 veterans had an ASCVD event during follow-up. Total LE8 score and each component LE8 factor score was associated with incident ASCVD in an inverse, linear, dose-response manner. For veterans without prior ASCVD, those with an LE8 score between 80 and 100 had lower risk of ASCVD compared with those with an LE8 score of 0 to 49 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.36 [95% CI, 0.35-0.38]). Similarly, risk of MACE was significantly lower among veterans with an LE8 score of 80 to 100 regardless of baseline ASCVD status (with ASCVD: aHR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.48-0.56]; without ASCVD: aHR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.13-0.15]) compared with those with ASCVD and an LE8 score of 0 to 49. In this cohort study of US veterans, higher LE8 scores were associated with significantly lower ASCVD incidence risk and lower likelihood of developing adverse cardiovascular events regardless of ASCVD status at baseline. These results support the utility of LE8 for health promotion and ASCVD prevention.",JAMA network open,2024,Humans; Male; Female; Aged; United States; Veterans; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Atherosclerosis; Incidence; Cardiovascular Diseases; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Risk Factors; Risk Assessment,False,8
Million Veteran Program,38242899,Genetic architecture distinguishes tinnitus from hearing loss.,"Tinnitus is a heritable, highly prevalent auditory disorder treated by multiple medical specialties. Previous GWAS indicated high genetic correlations between tinnitus and hearing loss, with little indication of differentiating signals. We present a GWAS meta-analysis, triple previous sample sizes, and expand to non-European ancestries. GWAS in 596,905 Million Veteran Program subjects identified 39 tinnitus loci, and identified genes related to neuronal synapses and cochlear structural support. Applying state-of-the-art analytic tools, we confirm a large number of shared variants, but also a distinct genetic architecture of tinnitus, with higher polygenicity and large proportion of variants not shared with hearing difficulty. Tissue-expression analysis for tinnitus infers broad enrichment across most brain tissues, in contrast to hearing difficulty. Finally, tinnitus is not only correlated with hearing loss, but also with a spectrum of psychiatric disorders, providing potential new avenues for treatment. This study establishes tinnitus as a distinct disorder separate from hearing difficulties.",Nature communications,2024,"Humans; Tinnitus; Cochlea; Deafness; Hearing Loss, Noise-Induced",False,6

Previous lung cancer GWAS have identified numerous loci, but separating the genetic risks of lung cancer and smoking behavioral susceptibility remains challenging. Here, we perform multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analyses of lung cancer using the Million Veteran Program cohort (approximately 95% male cases) and a previous study of European-ancestry individuals, jointly comprising 42,102 cases and 181,270 controls, followed by replication in an independent cohort of 19,404 cases and 17,378 controls. We then carry out conditional meta-analyses on cigarettes per day and identify two novel, replicated loci, including the 19p13.11 pleiotropic cancer locus in squamous cell lung carcinoma. Overall, we report twelve novel risk loci for overall lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell lung carcinoma, nine of which are externally replicated. Finally, we perform PheWAS on polygenic risk scores for lung cancer, with and without conditioning on smoking. The unconditioned lung cancer polygenic risk score is associated with smoking status in controls, illustrating a reduced predictive utility in non-smokers. Additionally, our polygenic risk score demonstrates smoking-independent pleiotropy of lung cancer risk across neoplasms and metabolic traits.",Nature communications,2024,"Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Case-Control Studies; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Lung Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Smoking; White; Ethnicity; Genetic Risk Score",False,2

To investigate the association of genetically proxied GLP-1RAs with kidney disease progression. This genetic association study assembled a national retrospective cohort of veterans aged 18 years or older from the US Department of Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program between January 10, 2011, and December 31, 2021. Data were analyzed from November 2023 to February 2024. Genetic risk score for systemic GLP1R gene expression that was calculated for each study participant based on genetic variants associated with GLP1R mRNA levels across all tissue samples within the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. The primary composite outcome was incident end-stage kidney disease or a 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate. Cox proportional hazards regression survival analysis assessed the association between genetically proxied GLP-1RAs and kidney disease progression. Among 353 153 individuals (92.5% men), median age was 66 years (IQR, 58.0-72.0 years) and median follow-up was 5.1 years (IQR, 3.1-7.2 years). Overall, 25.7% had diabetes, and 45.0% had obesity. A total of 4.6% experienced kidney disease progression. Overall, higher genetic GLP1R gene expression was associated with a lower risk of kidney disease progression in the unadjusted model (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99; P = .02) and in the fully adjusted model accounting for baseline patient characteristics, body mass index, and the presence or absence of diabetes (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-1.00; P = .04). The results were similar in sensitivity analyses stratified by diabetes or obesity status. In this genetic association study, higher GLP1R gene expression was associated with a small reduction in risk of kidney disease progression. These findings support pleiotropic nephroprotective mechanisms of GLP-1RAs independent of their effects on body weight and glycemic control.",JAMA network open,2024,"Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Disease Progression; Gene Expression; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Retrospective Studies; United States",False,2
Million Veteran Program,38918629,Adaptive selection at G6PD and disparities in diabetes complications.,"Diabetes complications occur at higher rates in individuals of African ancestry. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDdef), common in some African populations, confers malaria resistance, and reduces hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels by shortening erythrocyte lifespan. In a combined-ancestry genome-wide association study of diabetic retinopathy, we identified nine loci including a G6PDdef causal variant, rs1050828 -T (Val98Met), which was also associated with increased risk of other diabetes complications. The effect of rs1050828 -T on retinopathy was fully mediated by glucose levels. In the years preceding diabetes diagnosis and insulin prescription, glucose levels were significantly higher and HbA1c significantly lower in those with versus without G6PDdef. In the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial, participants with G6PDdef had significantly higher hazards of incident retinopathy and neuropathy. At the same HbA1c levels, G6PDdef participants in both ACCORD and the Million Veteran Program had significantly increased risk of retinopathy. We estimate that 12% and 9% of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy cases, respectively, in participants of African ancestry are due to this exposure. Across continentally defined ancestral populations, the differences in frequency of rs1050828 -T and other G6PDdef alleles contribute to disparities in diabetes complications. Diabetes management guided by glucose or potentially genotype-adjusted HbA1c levels could lead to more timely diagnoses and appropriate intensification of therapy, decreasing the risk of diabetes complications in patients with G6PDdef alleles.",Nature medicine,2024,"Humans; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase; Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency; Diabetic Retinopathy; Genome-Wide Association Study; Diabetes Complications; Glycated Hemoglobin; Male; Female; Black People; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Middle Aged; Blood Glucose",False,4
Million Veteran Program,38797326,Genome-wide association study of hospitalized patients and acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and devastating complication of hospitalization. Here, we identified genetic loci associated with AKI in patients hospitalized between 2002-2019 in the Million Veteran Program and data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center's BioVU. AKI was defined as meeting a modified KDIGO Stage 1 or more for two or more consecutive days or kidney replacement therapy. Control individuals were required to have one or more qualifying hospitalizations without AKI and no evidence of AKI during any other observed hospitalizations. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), stratified by race, adjusting for sex, age, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the top ten principal components of ancestry were conducted. Results were meta-analyzed using fixed effects models. In total, there were 54,488 patients with AKI and 138,051 non-AKI individuals included in the study. Two novel loci reached genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis: rs11642015 near the FTO locus on chromosome 16 (obesity traits) (odds ratio 1.07 (95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.09)) and rs4859682 near the SHROOM3 locus on chromosome 4 (glomerular filtration barrier integrity) (odds ratio 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.93-0.96)). These loci colocalized with previous studies of kidney function, and genetic correlation indicated significant shared genetic architecture between AKI and eGFR. Notably, the association at the FTO locus was attenuated after adjustment for BMI and diabetes, suggesting that this association may be partially driven by obesity. Both FTO and the SHROOM3 loci showed nominal evidence of replication from diagnostic-code-based summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and Biobank Japan. Thus, our large GWA meta-analysis found two loci significantly associated with AKI suggesting genetics may explain some risk for AKI.",Kidney international,2024,"Humans; Acute Kidney Injury; Genome-Wide Association Study; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Hospitalization; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase FTO; Risk Factors; Genetic Loci; Case-Control Studies",False,4

Here, we used FIB4 trajectory over time (ie, ""slope"" of FIB4) as a surrogate marker of liver fibrosis progression and examined if FIB4 slope is associated with clinical and genetic factors among individuals with clinically defined MASLD within the Million Veteran Program Cohort. In this retrospective cohort study, FIB4 slopes were estimated through linear regression for participants with clinically defined MASLD and FIB4 <2.67 at baseline. FIB4 slope was correlated with demographic parameters and clinical outcomes using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. FIB4 slope as a quantitative phenotype was used in a genome-wide association analysis in ancestry-specific analysis and multiancestry meta-analysis using METAL. FIB4 slopes, generated from 98,361 subjects with MASLD (16,045 African, 74,320 European, and 7996 Hispanic), showed significant associations with sex, ancestry, and cardiometabolic risk factors (p < 0.05). FIB4 slopes also correlated strongly with hepatic outcomes and were independently associated with time to cirrhosis. Five genetic loci showed genome-wide significant associations (p < 5 × 10-8) with FIB4 slope among European ancestry subjects, including 2 known (PNPLA3 and TM6SF2) and 3 novel loci (TERT 5.1 × 10-11; LINC01088, 3.9 × 10-8; and MRC1, 2.9 × 10-9).

Million Veteran Program,38545784,Evaluation of Plasma Biomarkers for Causal Association With Peripheral Artery Disease.,"Hundreds of biomarkers for peripheral artery disease (PAD) have been reported in the literature; however, the observational nature of these studies limits causal inference due to the potential of reverse causality and residual confounding. We sought to evaluate the potential causal impact of putative PAD biomarkers identified in human observational studies through genetic causal inference methods. Putative circulating PAD biomarkers were identified from human observational studies through a comprehensive literature search based on terms related to PAD using PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase. Genetic instruments were generated from publicly available genome-wide association studies of circulating biomarkers. Two-sample Mendelian randomization was used to test the association of genetically determined biomarker levels with PAD using summary statistics from a genome-wide association study of 31 307 individuals with and 211 753 individuals without PAD in the Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program and replicated in data from FinnGen comprised of 11 924 individuals with and 288 638 individuals without PAD. We identified 204 unique circulating biomarkers for PAD from the observational literature, of which 173 were genetically instrumented using genome-wide association study results. After accounting for multiple testing (false discovery rate, <0.05), 10 of 173 (5.8%) biomarkers had significant associations with PAD. These 10 biomarkers represented categories including plasma lipoprotein regulation, lipid homeostasis, and protein-lipid complex remodeling. Observational literature highlighted different pathways including inflammatory response, negative regulation of multicellular organismal processes, and regulation of response to external stimuli. Integrating human observational studies and genetic causal inference highlights several key pathways in PAD pathophysiology. This work demonstrates that a substantial portion of biomarkers identified in observational studies are not well supported by human genetic evidence and emphasizes the importance of triangulating evidence to understand PAD pathophysiology. Although the identified biomarkers offer insights into atherosclerotic development in the lower limb, their specificity to PAD compared with more widespread atherosclerosis requires further study.","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2024,"Humans; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Biomarkers; Genome-Wide Association Study; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Observational Studies as Topic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Risk Factors; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Predictive Value of Tests",False,3

Compared with array-based genotyping, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data provide better coverage of the genome and better representation of non-European variants. To better understand the genetic landscape regulating plasma fibrinogen levels, we meta-analyzed WGS data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program (n = 32 572), with array-based genotype data from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium (n = 131 340) imputed to the TOPMed or Haplotype Reference Consortium panel. We identified 18 loci that have not been identified in prior genetic studies of fibrinogen. Of these, 4 are driven by common variants of small effect with reported minor allele frequency (MAF) at least 10 percentage points higher in African populations. Three signals (SERPINA1, ZFP36L2, and TLR10) contain predicted deleterious missense variants. Two loci, SOCS3 and HPN, each harbor 2 conditionally distinct, noncoding variants. The gene region encoding the fibrinogen protein chain subunits (FGG;FGB;FGA) contains 7 distinct signals, including 1 novel signal driven by rs28577061, a variant common in African ancestry populations but extremely rare in Europeans (MAFAFR = 0.180; MAFEUR = 0.008). Through phenome-wide association studies in the VA Million Veteran Program, we found associations between fibrinogen polygenic risk scores and thrombotic and inflammatory disease phenotypes, including an association with gout.

Million Veteran Program,37967698,Brainwide Mendelian Randomization Study of Anxiety Disorders and Symptoms.,"To gain insights into the role of brain structure and function on anxiety (ANX), we conducted a genetically informed investigation leveraging information from ANX genome-wide association studies available from the UK Biobank (n = 380,379), the FinnGen Program (n = 290,361), and the Million Veteran Program (n = 175,163) together with UK Biobank genome-wide data (n = 33,224) related to 3935 brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs). A genetic correlation analysis between ANX and brain IDPs was performed using linkage disequilibrium score regression. To investigate ANX-brain associations, a 2-sample Mendelian randomization was performed considering multiple methods and sensitivity analyses. A subsequent multivariable Mendelian randomization was conducted to distinguish between direct and indirect effects. Finally, a generalized linear model was used to explore the associations of brain IDPs with ANX symptoms. After false discovery rate correction (q < .05), we identified 41 brain IDPs genetically correlated with ANX without heterogeneity among the datasets investigated (i.e., UK Biobank, FinnGen, and Million Veteran Program).

This extends to populations at greater risk of death by suicide, including U.S. military veterans. Despite this well-established association, it is unclear which measures of social connection are most useful in identifying veterans who could benefit from intervention to prevent suicide. To this end, we used data from the Million Veteran Program (MVP) to investigate the measures of social connection most strongly associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Our sample included 264,626 veterans who reported on three measures of social connection-marital status, household size, and perceived social support-and were assessed for suicidal thoughts and behaviors using electronic health records. Veterans who were partnered (OR = 0.78, 95% CI [0.76-0.80], p < .001), living with others (OR = 0.71, 95% CI [0.70-0.73], p < .001), or reported higher levels of social support (OR = 0.67, 95% CI [0.65-0.69], p < .001), were less likely to have suicidal thoughts and behaviors. These associations varied by veterans' age, sex, and era of military service. When combined into a single risk score, lower levels of social connection were associated with greater likelihood of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (β = 1.42, 95% CI [1.40-1.43], p < .001).

MVP is an ongoing longitudinal cohort and mega-biobank of over one million US Veterans. Over 500 000 MVP participants reported military exposures on the baseline survey, and over 300 000 reported occupational exposures on the lifestyle survey. We determined frequencies of selected self-reported occupational exposures by service era, specific deployment operation (1990-1991 Gulf War, Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF)), service in a combat zone and occupational categories. We also explored differences in self-reported exposures by sex and race. Agent Orange exposure was mainly reported by Vietnam-era Veterans. Gulf War and OEF/OIF Veterans deployed to a combat zone were more likely to report exposures to burn pits, chemical/biological weapons, anthrax vaccination and pyridostigmine bromide pill intake as compared with non-combat deployers and those not deployed. Occupational categories related to combat (infantry, combat engineer and helicopter pilot) often had the highest percentages of self-reported exposures, whereas those in healthcare-related occupations (dentists, physicians and occupational therapists) tended to report exposures much less often. Self-reported exposures also varied by race and sex.

The APOL gene cluster on chromosome 22 contains a total of 6 APOL genes that have arisen as a result of gene duplication.METHODSUsing a genome-first approach in the Penn Medicine BioBank, we identified 62 protein-altering variants in the 6 APOL genes with a minor allele frequency of >0.1% in a population of participants genetically similar to African reference populations and performed population-specific phenome-wide association studies.RESULTSWe identified rs1108978, a stop-gain variant in APOL3 (p.Q58*), to be significantly associated with increased CKD risk, even after conditioning on APOL1 G1/G2 carrier status. These findings were replicated in the Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program and the All of Us Research Program. APOL3 p.Q58* was also significantly associated with a number of quantitative traits linked to CKD, including decreased kidney volume. This truncating variant contributed the most risk for CKD in patients monoallelic for APOL1 G1/G2, suggesting an epistatic interaction and a potential protective effect of wild-type APOL3 against APOL1-induced kidney disease.CONCLUSIONThis study demonstrates the utility of targeting population-specific variants in a genome-first approach, even in the context of well-studied gene-disease relationships.FUNDINGNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (F30HL172382, R01HL169378, R01HL169458), Doris Duke Foundation (grant 2023-2024), National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (P41EB029460), and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (UL1-TR-001878).",JCI insight,2024,"Humans; Apolipoprotein L1; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Epistasis, Genetic; Alleles; Male; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Aged; Gene Frequency; Risk Factors",False,0
Million Veteran Program,39134740,A genome-wide investigation into the underlying genetic architecture of personality traits and overlap with psychopathology.,"Personality is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors and is associated with other psychiatric traits such as anxiety and depression. The 'big five' personality traits, which include neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness, are a widely accepted and influential framework for understanding and describing human personality. Of the big five personality traits, neuroticism has most often been the focus of genetic studies and is linked to various mental illnesses, including depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. Our knowledge of the genetic architecture of the other four personality traits is more limited. Here, utilizing the Million Veteran Program cohort, we conducted a genome-wide association study in individuals of European and African ancestry. Adding other published data, we performed genome-wide association study meta-analysis for each of the five personality traits with sample sizes ranging from 237,390 to 682,688. We identified 208, 14, 3, 2 and 7 independent genome-wide significant loci associated with neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness, respectively. These findings represent 62 novel loci for neuroticism, as well as the first genome-wide significant loci discovered for agreeableness. Gene-based association testing revealed 254 genes showing significant association with at least one of the five personality traits. Transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide analysis identified altered expression of genes and proteins such as CRHR1, SLC12A5, MAPT and STX4. Pathway enrichment and drug perturbation analyses identified complex biology underlying human personality traits. We also studied the inter-relationship of personality traits with 1,437 other traits in a phenome-wide genetic correlation analysis, identifying new associations. Mendelian randomization showed positive bidirectional effects between neuroticism and depression and anxiety, while a negative bidirectional effect was observed for agreeableness and these psychiatric traits.

Million Veteran Program,38897203,Identification and correction for collider bias in a genome-wide association study of diabetes-related heart failure.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major risk factor for heart failure (HF) and has elevated incidence among individuals with HF. Since genetics and HF can independently influence T2D, collider bias may occur when T2D (i.e., collider) is controlled for by design or analysis. Thus, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of diabetes-related HF with correction for collider bias. We first performed a GWAS of HF to identify genetic instrumental variables (GIVs) for HF and to enable bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis between T2D and HF. We identified 61 genomic loci, significantly associated with all-cause HF in 114,275 individuals with HF and over 1.5 million controls of European ancestry. Using a two-sample bidirectional MR approach with 59 and 82 GIVs for HF and T2D, respectively, we estimated that T2D increased HF risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.10), while HF also increased T2D risk (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.36-1.88). Then we performed a GWAS of diabetes-related HF corrected for collider bias due to the study design of index cases. After removing the spurious association of TCF7L2 locus due to collider bias, we identified two genome-wide significant loci close to PITX2 (chromosome 4) and CDKN2B-AS1 (chromosome 9) associated with diabetes-related HF in the Million Veteran Program and replicated the associations in the UK Biobank. Our MR findings provide strong evidence that HF increases T2D risk.

PTSD symptoms (B = 0.50-0.52, p < 1E-250) and probable TBI (B = 0.05-0.19, p = 1.51E-07 - 0.002) were positively associated with SCC across all three ancestry groups. APOE ε4 was associated with greater SCC in EA Veterans aged 65 and older (B = 0.037, p = 1.88E-12). Results of Cox models indicated that PTSD symptoms (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.13-1.21), APOE ε4 (HR = 1.73-2.05) and SCC (HR = 1.18-1.37) were positively associated with risk for ADRD across all three ancestry groups. In the EA group, probable TBI also contributed to increased risk of ADRD (HR = 1.18). The findings underscore the value of SCC as an indicator of ADRD risk in Veterans 65 and older when considered in conjunction with other influential genetic, clinical, and demographic risk factors.",Alzheimer's research & therapy,2024,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Apolipoprotein E4; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Dementia; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; United States; Veterans",False,6
Million Veteran Program,37938835,Correlates of Risk for Disinhibited Behaviors in the Million Veteran Program Cohort.,"Many psychiatric outcomes share a common etiologic pathway reflecting behavioral disinhibition, generally referred to as externalizing (EXT) disorders. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have demonstrated the overlap between EXT disorders and important aspects of veterans' health, such as suicide-related behaviors and substance use disorders (SUDs). To explore correlates of risk for EXT disorders within the Veterans Health Administration (VA) Million Veteran Program (MVP). A series of phenome-wide association studies (PheWASs) of polygenic risk scores (PGSs) for EXT disorders was conducted using electronic health records. First, ancestry-specific PheWASs of EXT PGSs were conducted in the African, European, and Hispanic or Latin American ancestries. Next, a conditional PheWAS, covarying for PGSs of comorbid psychiatric problems (depression, schizophrenia, and suicide attempt; European ancestries only), was performed. Lastly, to adjust for unmeasured confounders, a within-family analysis of significant associations from the main PheWAS was performed in full siblings (European ancestries only). This study included the electronic health record data from US veterans from VA health care centers enrolled in MVP. Analyses took place from February 2022 to August 2023 covering a period from October 1999 to January 2020. PGSs for EXT, depression, schizophrenia, and suicide attempt. Phecodes for diagnoses derived from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions, Clinical Modification, codes from electronic health records. Within the MVP (560 824 patients; mean [SD] age, 67.9 [14.3] years; 512 593 male [91.4%]), the EXT PGS was associated with 619 outcomes, of which 188 were independent of risk for comorbid problems or PGSs (from odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03 for overweight/obesity to OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.42-1.47 for viral hepatitis C). Of the significant outcomes, 73 (11.9%) were significant in the African results and 26 (4.5%) were significant in the Hispanic or Latin American results. Within-family analyses uncovered robust associations between EXT PGS and consequences of SUDs, including liver disease, chronic airway obstruction, and viral hepatitis C. Results of this cohort study suggest a shared polygenic basis of EXT disorders, independent of risk for other psychiatric problems. In addition, this study found associations between EXT PGS and diagnoses related to SUDs and their sequelae. Overall, this study highlighted the potential negative consequences of EXT disorders for health and functioning in the US veteran population.",JAMA psychiatry,2024,"Humans; Male; Aged; Veterans; Cohort Studies; Genome-Wide Association Study; Schizophrenia; Substance-Related Disorders; Hepatitis, Viral, Human",False,0
Million Veteran Program,38804128,Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies Reveals Genetic Mechanisms of Supraventricular Arrhythmias.,"Substantial data support a heritable basis for supraventricular tachycardias, but the genetic determinants and molecular mechanisms of these arrhythmias are poorly understood. We sought to identify genetic loci associated with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and atrioventricular accessory pathways or atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVAPs/AVRT). We performed multiancestry meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies to identify genetic loci for AVNRT (4 studies) and AVAP/AVRT (7 studies). We assessed evidence supporting the potential causal effects of candidate genes by analyzing relations between associated variants and cardiac gene expression, performing transcriptome-wide analyses, and examining prior genome-wide association studies. Analyses comprised 2384 AVNRT cases and 106 489 referents, and 2811 AVAP/AVRT cases and 1,483 093 referents.

The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between TBI history and a wide range of medical conditions in a large, national sample of veterans, and to explore interactions with gender. Participants of this cross-sectional epidemiological study included 491,604 veterans (9.9% TBI cases; 8.3% women) who enrolled in the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP). Outcomes of interest were medical comorbidities (i.e., neurological, mental health, circulatory, and other medical conditions) assessed using the MVP Baseline Survey, a self-report questionnaire. Logistic regression models adjusting for age and gender showed that veterans with TBI history consistently had significantly higher rates of medical comorbidities than controls, with the greatest differences observed across mental health (odds ratios [ORs] = 2.10-3.61) and neurological (ORs = 1.57-6.08) conditions. Similar patterns were found when evaluating men and women separately. Additionally, significant TBI-by-gender interactions were observed, particularly for mental health and neurological comorbidities, such that men with a history of TBI had greater odds of having several of these conditions than women with a history of TBI. These findings highlight the array of medical comorbidities experienced by veterans with a history of TBI, and illustrate that clinical outcomes differ for men and women with TBI history. Although these results are clinically informative, more research is needed to better understand the role of gender on health conditions in the context of TBI and how gender interacts with other social and cultural factors to influence clinical trajectories following TBI. Ultimately, understanding the biological, psychological, and social mechanisms underlying these comorbidities may help with tailoring TBI treatment by gender and improve quality of life for veterans with TBI history.",Journal of neurotrauma,2024,"Male; Humans; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Quality of Life; Veterans; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Comorbidity",False,2

Investigating migraine prevalence, associated comorbidities, and potential military service exposures in veterans, focusing on gender differences, is crucial for targeted interventions and management strategies. To determine the prevalence of migraine, associated health comorbidities, and potential military service and environmental exposures among men and women US veterans using a large-scale epidemiological sample from the Million Veteran Program (MVP). This cross-sectional study analyzed self-report survey data from the MVP, a large epidemiological sample of US veterans that was started in 2011 and has ongoing enrollment. Eligible participants were selected from the MVP database in 2023. The study included 491 604 veterans to examine migraine prevalence, health comorbidities, demographic characteristics, military service history, and environmental exposures. Data were analyzed from December 2022 to July 2023. Military service and environmental factors, such as chemical or biological warfare exposure, were considered. The primary outcome was migraine prevalence among men and women veterans, assessed through self-reported diagnoses. Secondary outcomes included the association between migraine and health comorbidities, demographic characteristics, military service history, and environmental exposures. Of the 491 604 veterans included in this study, 450 625 (91.8%) were men and 40 979 (8.2%) were women. The lifetime prevalence of migraine was significantly higher in women (12 324 of 40 979 [30.1%]) than in men (36 816 of 450 625 [8.2%]). Migraine prevalence varied by race and ethnicity, with the highest prevalence in Hispanic or Latinx women (1213 of 3495 [34.7%]). Veterans with migraine reported worse general health, higher levels of pain, increased pain interference with work, a higher likelihood of psychiatric and neurological health conditions, and greater lifetime opioid use. Specific aspects of military service, including service post-September 2001 and deployment in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, and environmental factors, including Agent Orange, chemical and biological welfare, and antinerve agent pills history, were significantly associated with migraine prevalence. In this cross-sectional study of migraine, the results highlighted gender differences in migraine prevalence and associated health comorbidities among US veterans. The findings emphasized the need for interdisciplinary approaches to migraine management, increased awareness and education efforts, and population-based screening strategies, particularly for women and Hispanic veterans who are at greater risk. Our findings encourage further research into tailored interventions for specific subpopulations and the impact of military service and environmental exposures on migraine and related health conditions.",JAMA network open,2024,Male; Humans; Female; Veterans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Migraine Disorders; Pain,False,2

We developed and validated electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithms to identify DR cases and individuals with type I or II diabetes without DR (controls) in 3 independent EHR systems: Vanderbilt University Medical Center Synthetic Derivative (VUMC), the VA Northeast Ohio Healthcare System (VANEOHS), and Massachusetts General Brigham (MGB). Cases were required to meet 1 of the following 3 criteria: (1) 2 or more dates with any DR ICD-9/10 code documented in the EHR, (2) at least one affirmative health-factor or EPIC code for DR along with an ICD9/10 code for DR on a different day, or (3) at least one ICD-9/10 code for any DR occurring within 24 hours of an ophthalmology examination. Criteria for controls included affirmative evidence for diabetes as well as an ophthalmology examination. The algorithms, developed and evaluated in VUMC through manual chart review, resulted in a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.93 for cases and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.91 for controls. Implementation of algorithms yielded similar metrics in VANEOHS (PPV = 0.94; NPV = 0.86) and lower in MGB (PPV = 0.84; NPV = 0.76). In comparison, the algorithm for DR implemented in Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) in VUMC yielded similar PPV (0.92) but substantially reduced NPV (0.48). Implementation of the algorithms to the Million Veteran Program identified over 62 000 DR cases with genetic data including 14 549 African Americans and 6209 Hispanics with DR. We demonstrate the robustness of the algorithms at 3 separate healthcare centers, with a minimum PPV of 0.84 and substantially improved NPV than existing automated methods.

It adversely affects the quality of life and imposes substantial personal and economic costs. Efforts to treat chronic pain using opioids had a central role in precipitating the opioid crisis. Despite an estimated heritability of 25-50%, the genetic architecture of chronic pain is not well-characterized, in part because studies have largely been limited to samples of European ancestry. To help address this knowledge gap, we conducted a cross-ancestry meta-analysis of pain intensity in 598,339 participants in the Million Veteran Program, which identified 126 independent genetic loci, 69 of which are new. Pain intensity was genetically correlated with other pain phenotypes, level of substance use and substance use disorders, other psychiatric traits, education level and cognitive traits. Integration of the genome-wide association studies findings with functional genomics data shows enrichment for putatively causal genes (n = 142) and proteins (n = 14) expressed in brain tissues, specifically in GABAergic neurons.

Blood pressure and lipid profile are established risk factors of HF. We performed univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess potential causal effects of blood pressures and lipids on HF subtypes. Genetic instruments for blood pressures and lipids were derived from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) among the European participants of the UK Biobank. GWAS summaries of HFrEF and HFpEF were obtained from the meta-analysis of the European participants from the Million Veteran Program and the Vanderbilt University DNA Databank. Systolic blood pressure exhibited a supportive MR association primarily with HFpEF (odds ratio [OR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.23), while diastolic blood pressure had an independent MR association with HFrEF (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.13-1.77). MR associations also supported the observation that higher levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increase the risk for both subtypes (HFrEF OR, 1.10 and 95% CI, 1.05-1.17; HFpEF OR, 1.05 and 95% CI, 1.02-1.09).

Cancer care for WVs is complex and it is essential to understand their unique needs and care coordination challenges to provide evidence-based care. The purpose of this review is to map the quantity, distribution, and characteristics of literature describing cancer and its treatment among WVs. We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase (Elsevier), and Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate) from inception through January, 2024. Publications were eligible that reported gender-specific data on any aspect of cancer care among WVs. Data was abstracted by a single investigator with over-reading. Forty-six reports were included; 44 were observational and 19 had a women-only sample. There were no interventional reports and no qualitative reports had a patient sample. Breast cancer was the most commonly addressed (n = 19). There were six additional reports on sex-specific cancers. Many reports used large VA databases or previous trial data, creating the potential for patient overlap between reports. Among VA-specific areas of interest, only three reports evaluated the potential implications of racial differences and only two included a transgender population. No reports examined the effects of toxic exposures on cancer. Within the NCI Cancer Control Continuum, crosscutting areas were more commonly represented; over half (25) of the reports addressed epidemiology. There were few reports on focus areas and little overlap between focus and crosscutting areas. Existing literature provides an inadequate understanding of the population of WVs with cancer.

The common adrenal-permissive HSD3B1(1245C) allele is responsible for encoding the 3β-HSD1 protein with decreased susceptibility to degradation resulting in higher extragonadal androgen synthesis. Retrospective studies have suggested an association of the HSD3B1 adrenal-permissive homozygous genotype with androgen deprivation therapy resistance in prostate cancer. To evaluate differences in mortality outcomes by HSD3B1 genetic status among men with prostate cancer. This cohort study of patients with prostate cancer who were enrolled in the Million Veteran Program within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system between 2011 and 2023 collected genotyping and phenotyping information. HSD3B1 genotype status was categorized as AA (homozygous adrenal-restrictive), AC (heterozygous adrenal-restrictive), or CC (homozygous adrenal-permissive). The primary outcome of this study was prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), defined as the time from diagnosis to death from prostate cancer, censored at the date of last VHA follow-up. Secondary outcomes included incidence of metastases and PCSM in predefined subgroups. Of the 5287 participants (median [IQR] age, 69 [64-74] years), 402 (7.6%) had the CC genotype, 1970 (37.3%) had the AC genotype, and 2915 (55.1%) had the AA genotype. Overall, the primary cause of death for 91 patients (1.7%) was prostate cancer. Cumulative incidence of PCSM at 5 years after prostate cancer diagnosis was higher among men with the CC genotype (4.0%; 95% CI, 1.7%-6.2%) compared with the AC genotype (2.1%; 95% CI, 1.3%-2.8%) and AA genotype (1.9%; 95% CI, 1.3%-2.4%) (P = .02). In the 619 patients who developed metastatic disease at any time, the cumulative incidence of PCSM at 5 years was higher among patients with the CC genotype (36.0%; 95% CI, 16.7%-50.8%) compared with the AC genotype (17.9%; 95% CI, 10.5%-24.7%) and AA genotype (18.5%; 95% CI, 12.0%-24.6%) (P = .01).

Previous case reports and case series suggest an association may exist between these diseases, as well as an increased risk of SLE after thymectomy for MG. We undertook this study to determine whether SLE and MG were associated in large cohorts. We searched the IBM Watson Health Explorys platform and the Department of Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program (MVP) database for diagnoses of SLE and MG. In addition, we examined subjects enrolled in the Lupus Family Registry and Repository (LFRR) as well as controls for a diagnosis of MG. Among 59,780,210 individuals captured in Explorys, there were 25,750 with MG and 65,370 with SLE. 370 subjects had both. Those with MG were >10 times more likely to have SLE than those without MG. Those with both diseases were more likely to be women, African American, and at a younger age than MG subjects without SLE. In addition, the MG patients who underwent thymectomy had an increased risk of SLE compared to MG patients who had not undergone thymectomy (OR 3.11, 95% CI: 2.12 to 4.55). Autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anemia and miscellaneous comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease were significantly more common in MG patients who developed SLE. In the MVP, SLE and MG were also significantly associated. Association of SLE and MG in a large SLE cohort with rigorous SLE classification confirmed the association of SLE with MG at a similar level. While the number of patients with both MG and SLE is small, SLE and MG are strongly associated together in very large databases and a large SLE cohort.","Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",2024,"Female; Humans; Male; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Myasthenia Gravis; Thymectomy",False,2

Veterans (N = 12,985) were classified into the following TBI/SCI groups using CTBIE data: those with a dual diagnosis of TBI and SCI (TBI+/SCI+); those with a history of TBI but no SCI (TBI+/SCI-); and those with no history of TBI or SCI (TBI-/SCI-; i.e., the control group). CTBIE-derived outcomes included neurobehavioral symptoms, comorbid psychiatric symptoms, pain and pain interference, and employment status. Chi-square analyses showed significant associations between TBI/SCI group and all clinical outcomes evaluated (all p's < .001; V = 0.07-0.11). In general, the TBI+/SCI+ and TBI +/SCI- groups endorsed comparable levels of neurobehavioral symptoms, psychiatric symptoms, and pain, but significantly greater rates of symptoms and pain relative to the TBI-/SCI- group. Effect sizes for all pairwise comparisons were small (φ = 0.01-0.11). Finally, there was no significant association between TBI/SCI group and employment status (p = .170; V = 0.02), with all three groups showing relatively comparable rates of unemployment. Regardless of SCI status, Veterans with TBI history endorsed poorer clinical outcomes than Veterans without TBI and SCI. However, rates of unemployment were similarly high across all three groups. Findings suggest that any Veteran completing the CTBIE may be at risk for poor clinical and employment outcomes.","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2024,"Humans; Veterans; Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry); Cross-Sectional Studies; Quality of Life; Employment; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Substance-Related Disorders; Pain; Spinal Cord Injuries",False,7
Million Veteran Program,39551068,Effectiveness and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors in Black patients versus White patients in a US national health system: a retrospective cohort study.,"Black patients were severely under-represented in the clinical trials that led to the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for all cancers. The aim of this study was to characterise the effectiveness and safety of ICIs in Black patients. We did a retrospective cohort study of patients in the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system's Corporate Data Warehouse containing electronic medical records for all patients who self-identified as non-Hispanic Black or African American (referred to as Black) or non-Hispanic White (referred to as White) and received PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, or LAG-3 inhibitors between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2023. Effectiveness outcomes were overall survival, time to treatment discontinuation, and time to next treatment. The safety outcome was the frequency of immune-related adverse events; assessed among a random sample of 1000 Black patients and 1000 White patients, 892 pairs were matched on the basis of baseline characteristics using 1:1 exact matching without replacement. After manual chart review, patients who did not receive ICI therapy or who had inadequate follow-up were excluded. The adjusted effect of race on each effectiveness outcome was assessed in the whole ICI-treated cohort with propensity-weighted Cox regression with robust standard errors. Immune-related adverse events outcomes were analysed in the random matched sample with multivariable Cox regression, adjusting for baseline characteristics. We identified 26 398 patients, of whom 4943 (18·7%) patients were Black, 21 455 (81·3%) were White, 895 (3·4%) were female, 25 503 (96·6%) were male, 11 859 (45%) had non-small-cell lung cancer, and 26 045 (98·7%) received PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. As of data cutoff (Aug 28, 2024), median follow-up was 40·3 months (95% CI 38·3-42·3) for Black patients and 43·9 months (43·0-45·1) for White patients. Compared with White patients, Black patients had longer time to treatment discontinuation (2-year unadjusted rates 10·7% [95% CI 9·8-11·7] for Black patients vs 8·6% [8·2-9·0] for White patients; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·91, 95% CI 0·87-0·95, p<0·0001), similar time to next treatment (23·5% [22·3-24·8] for Black patients vs 25·6% [25·0-26·2] for White patients; 1·00, 0·95-1·05, p=0·96), and slightly improved overall survival (36·5% [35·2-38·1] for Black patients vs 36·5% [35·8-37·1]; 0·95, 0·90-0·99, p=0·036). 1710 patients (n=862 Black and n=848 White) were analysed for safety outcomes. Compared with White patients, Black patients had a reduced risk of all-grade immune-related adverse events (unadjusted 2-year rate 33·1% [95% CI 28·9-37·1] vs 44·1% [95% CI 39·1-48·7]; adjusted HR 0·75, 95% CI 0·62-0·90, p=0·0026), immune-related adverse events requiring treatment with systemic steroids (0·61, 0·46-0·81, p=0·00051), and immune-related adverse events resulting in permanent ICI discontinuation (0·58, 0·44-0·78, p=0·00024). In exploratory analyses of irAE subtypes, a significant risk reduction in Black patients was found for colitis (0·46, 0·27-0·76, p=0·0026) and hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism (0·63, 0·44-0·90, p=0·011), and no significant differences were found for any other immune-related adverse event subtypes analysed. Similar results were found in analyses using a steroid-based definition of immune-related adverse events among the entire ICI-treated cohort. Compared with White patients, Black patients had similar ICI effectiveness and lower toxicities among those treated in the national VHA system, potentially reflecting an important difference in the therapeutic ratio (ratio of benefit to harm) of ICIs. Our findings of decreased toxicity among Black patients require further investigation to assess their generalisability.

To dissect the pleiotropic mechanisms contributing to COVID-19/anxiety comorbidity, we used genome-wide data from UK Biobank (up to 420,531 participants), FinnGen Project (up to 329,077 participants), Million Veteran Program (175,163 participants), and COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (up to 122,616 cases and 2,475,240 controls). Specifically, we assessed global and local genetic correlation and genetically inferred effects linking COVID-19 outcomes (infection, hospitalization, and severe respiratory symptoms) to anxiety disorders and symptoms. We observed a strong genetic correlation of anxiety disorder with COVID-19 positive status (rg = 0.35, p = 2×10 This study provided insights into the pleiotropic mechanisms linking COVID-19 and anxiety outcomes, suggesting differences between dynamics related to anxiety disorders and those related to anxiety symptoms.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Humans; COVID-19; Anxiety Disorders; Anxiety; Pain; Ethanol; Genome-Wide Association Study,False,4

Million Veteran Program,38245528,High dimensional predictions of suicide risk in 4.2 million US Veterans using ensemble transfer learning.,"We present an ensemble transfer learning method to predict suicide from Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic medical records (EMR). A diverse set of base models was trained to predict a binary outcome constructed from reported suicide, suicide attempt, and overdose diagnoses with varying choices of study design and prediction methodology. Each model used twenty cross-sectional and 190 longitudinal variables observed in eight time intervals covering 7.5 years prior to the time of prediction. Ensembles of seven base models were created and fine-tuned with ten variables expected to change with study design and outcome definition in order to predict suicide and combined outcome in a prospective cohort. The ensemble models achieved c-statistics of 0.73 on 2-year suicide risk and 0.83 on the combined outcome when predicting on a prospective cohort of [Formula: see text] 4.2 M veterans. The ensembles rely on nonlinear base models trained using a matched retrospective nested case-control (Rcc) study cohort and show good calibration across a diversity of subgroups, including risk strata, age, sex, race, and level of healthcare utilization. In addition, a linear Rcc base model provided a rich set of biological predictors, including indicators of suicide, substance use disorder, mental health diagnoses and treatments, hypoxia and vascular damage, and demographics.",Scientific reports,2024,"Humans; Veterans; Retrospective Studies; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Cross-Sectional Studies; Prospective Studies; Suicide, Attempted; Kidney Neoplasms; Machine Learning",False,7
Million Veteran Program,39254429,Recalibrating the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium Environmental Risk Score for Use in US Veterans.,"Risk for colorectal cancer may accumulate through multiple environmental factors. Understanding their effects, along with genetics, age, and family history, could allow improvements in clinical decisions for screening protocols. We aimed to extend the previous work by recalibrating an environmental risk score (e-Score) for colorectal cancer among a sample of US veteran participants of the Million Veteran Program. Demographic, lifestyle, and colorectal cancer data from 2011 to 2022 were abstracted from survey responses and health records of 227,504 male Million Veteran Program participants. Weighting for each environmental factor's effect size was recalculated using Veterans Affairs training data to create a recalibrated e-Score. This recalibrated score was compared with the original weighted e-Score in a validation sample of 113,752 (n cases = 590). Nested multiple logistic regression models tested associations between quintiles for recalibrated and original e-Scores. Likelihood ratio tests were used to compare model performance. Age (P < 0.0001), education (P < 0.0001), diabetes (P < 0.0001), physical activity (P < 0.0001), smoking (P < 0.0001), NSAID use (P < 0.0001), calcium (P = 0.015), folate (P = 0.020), and fruit consumption (P = 0.019) were significantly different between colorectal cancer case and control groups. In the validation sample, the recalibrated e-Score model significantly improved the base model performance (P < 0.001), but the original e-Score model did not (P = 0.07). The recalibrated e-Score model quintile 5 was associated with significantly higher odds for colorectal cancer compared with quintile 1 (Q5 vs. Q1: 1.79; 95% CI, 1.38-2.33). Multiple environmental factors and the recalibrated e-Score quintiles were significantly associated with colorectal cancer cases. A recalibrated, veteran-specific e-Score could be used to help personalize colorectal cancer screening and prevention strategies.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",2024,Humans; Colorectal Neoplasms; Male; Veterans; United States; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Aged; Risk Assessment; Female,False,4
Million Veteran Program,38309480,Polygenic risk for suicide attempt is associated with lifetime suicide attempt in US soldiers independent of parental risk.,"Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide. Whereas some studies have suggested that a direct measure of common genetic liability for suicide attempts (SA), captured by a polygenic risk score for SA (SA-PRS), explains risk independent of parental history, further confirmation would be useful. Even more unsettled is the extent to which SA-PRS is associated with lifetime non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). We used summary statistics from the largest available GWAS study of SA to generate SA-PRS for two non-overlapping cohorts of soldiers of European ancestry. These were tested in multivariable models that included parental major depressive disorder (MDD) and parental SA. In the first cohort, 417 (6.3 %) of 6573 soldiers reported lifetime SA and 1195 (18.2 %) reported lifetime NSSI. In a multivariable model that included parental history of MDD and parental history of SA, SA-PRS remained significantly associated with lifetime SA [aOR = 1.26, 95%CI:1.13-1.39, p < 0.001] per standardized unit SA-PRS]. In the second cohort, 204 (4.2 %) of 4900 soldiers reported lifetime SA, and 299 (6.1 %) reported lifetime NSSI. In a multivariable model that included parental history of MDD and parental history of SA, SA-PRS remained significantly associated with lifetime SA [aOR = 1.20, 95%CI:1.04-1.38, p = 0.014]. A combined analysis of both cohorts yielded similar results. In neither cohort or in the combined analysis was SA-PRS significantly associated with NSSI. PRS for SA conveys information about likelihood of lifetime SA (but not NSSI, demonstrating specificity), independent of self-reported parental history of MDD and parental history of SA. At present, the magnitude of effects is small and would not be immediately useful for clinical decision-making or risk-stratified prevention initiatives, but this may be expected to improve with further iterations. Also critical will be the extension of these findings to more diverse populations.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,"Humans; Suicide, Attempted; Suicidal Ideation; Depressive Disorder, Major; Military Personnel; Risk Factors; Self-Injurious Behavior; Parents",False,9
Million Veteran Program,37840448,Associations of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cirrhosis with liver cancer in European and East Asian populations: A Mendelian randomization study.,"The positive relationships of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cirrhosis with liver cancer were shown in previous observational studies, while further Mendelian randomization (MR) investigations are needed to confirm the possible causal associations. This study aimed to explore whether NAFLD and cirrhosis were causally related to liver cancer using MR in European and East Asian populations. For European populations, NAFLD data were obtained from a genome-wide meta-analysis (8434 patients and 770 180 controls). The data on chronic elevation of alanine aminotransferase (cALT), a proxy of NAFLD, were derived from Million Veteran Program (68 725 patients and 95 472 controls). Cirrhosis data were collected from two sources: a genome-wide association study of five cohorts (4829 patients and 72 705 controls) and FinnGen (1931 patients and 216 861 controls). Liver cancer data were collected from FinnGen (304 patients and 174 006 controls). For East Asian populations, the data on cirrhosis (2184 patients and 210 269 controls) and hepatocellular carcinoma (1866 patients and 195 745 controls) were obtained from Biobank Japan. Three, 41, seven, six, and three single-nucleotide polymorphisms were used for NAFLD (European), cALT (European), cirrhosis (European-five cohorts), cirrhosis (European-FinnGen), and cirrhosis (East Asian), respectively. We used inverse-variance weighted as the primary method to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Among European populations, genetically-predicted NAFLD, cALT, cirrhosis (five cohorts), and cirrhosis (FinnGen) were positively associated with liver cancer, with ORs (95% CIs) of 6.62 (3.81-11.50) (p < .001), 2.59 (1.70-3.94) (p < .001), 3.38 (2.41-4.75) (p < .001), and 2.62 (1.20-5.72) (p = .015). Among East Asian populations, there was also a positive association between genetically-predicted cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.78-2.52; p < .001). This study utilized MR to complementarily confirm the positive connections of NAFLD and cirrhosis with liver cancer, as identified in earlier observational research. Subsequent MR investigations involving more liver cancer cases are needed.","Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",2024,"Humans; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; East Asian People; Genome-Wide Association Study; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Neoplasms; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Observational Studies as Topic; European People",False,3
Million Veteran Program,38481028,Centralized Interactive Phenomics Resource: an integrated online phenomics knowledgebase for health data users.,"Development of clinical phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) can be resource intensive. Several phenotype libraries have been created to facilitate reuse of definitions. However, these platforms vary in target audience and utility. We describe the development of the Centralized Interactive Phenomics Resource (CIPHER) knowledgebase, a comprehensive public-facing phenotype library, which aims to facilitate clinical and health services research. The platform was designed to collect and catalog EHR-based computable phenotype algorithms from any healthcare system, scale metadata management, facilitate phenotype discovery, and allow for integration of tools and user workflows. Phenomics experts were engaged in the development and testing of the site. The knowledgebase stores phenotype metadata using the CIPHER standard, and definitions are accessible through complex searching. Phenotypes are contributed to the knowledgebase via webform, allowing metadata validation. Data visualization tools linking to the knowledgebase enhance user interaction with content and accelerate phenotype development. The CIPHER knowledgebase was developed in the largest healthcare system in the United States and piloted with external partners. The design of the CIPHER website supports a variety of front-end tools and features to facilitate phenotype development and reuse. Health data users are encouraged to contribute their algorithms to the knowledgebase for wider dissemination to the research community, and to use the platform as a springboard for phenotyping. CIPHER is a public resource for all health data users available at https://phenomics.va.ornl.gov/ which facilitates phenotype reuse, development, and dissemination of phenotyping knowledge.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Phenomics; Phenotype; Electronic Health Records; Knowledge Bases; Algorithms,False,1
Million Veteran Program,38634508,Genetic Causal Relationship Between Alanine Aminotransferase Levels and Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Mendelian Randomization Analysis Based on Two Samples.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a frequent complication of pregnancy. The specific mechanisms underlying GDM have not yet been fully elucidated. Contemporary research indicates a potential association between liver enzyme irregularities and an increased risk of metabolic disorders, including diabetes. The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level is recognized as a sensitive marker of liver injury. An increase in ALT levels is hypothesized to be linked to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and diabetes. Nonetheless, the definitive causal link between ALT levels and GDM still needs to be determined. This investigation utilized two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to examine the genetic causation between alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and GDM. We acquired alanine aminotransferase (ALT)-related GWAS summary data from the UK Biobank, Million Veteran Program, Rotterdam Study, and Lifeline Study. Gestational diabetes data were obtained from the FinnGen Consortium. We employed various MR analysis techniques, including inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR Egger, weighted median, simple, and weighted weighting. In addition to MR-Egger intercepts, Cochrane's Q test was also used to assess heterogeneity in the MR data, and the MR-PRESSO test was used to assess horizontal pleiotropy. To assess the association's sensitivity, a leave-one-out approach was employed. The IVW results confirmed the independent risk factor for GDM development, as indicated by the ALT level (",Twin research and human genetics : the official journal of the International Society for Twin Studies,2024,"Humans; Female; Diabetes, Gestational; Alanine Transaminase; Pregnancy; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Genome-Wide Association Study; Risk Factors; Adult; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Predisposition to Disease",False,4
Million Veteran Program,38580710,Heterogeneous associations between interleukin-6 receptor variants and phenotypes across ancestries and implications for therapy.,"The Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) is increasingly used to broadly screen for potential treatment effects, e.g., IL6R variant as a proxy for IL6R antagonists. This approach offers an opportunity to address the limited power in clinical trials to study differential treatment effects across patient subgroups. However, limited methods exist to efficiently test for differences across subgroups in the thousands of multiple comparisons generated as part of a PheWAS. In this study, we developed an approach that maximizes the power to test for heterogeneous genotype-phenotype associations and applied this approach to an IL6R PheWAS among individuals of African (AFR) and European (EUR) ancestries. We identified 29 traits with differences in IL6R variant-phenotype associations, including a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in AFR (OR 0.96) vs EUR (OR 1.0, p-value for heterogeneity = 8.5 × 10",Scientific reports,2024,"Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Genetic Association Studies; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, Interleukin-6",False,1

We present GRIN (Gene set Refinement through Interacting Networks), which increases confidence in the expanded gene set by retaining genes strongly connected by biological networks when GWAS thresholds are relaxed. GRIN was validated on both simulated interrelated gene sets as well as multiple GWAS traits. From multiple GWAS summary statistics of suicide attempt, a complex phenotype, GRIN identified additional genes that replicated across independent cohorts and retained biologically interrelated genes despite a relaxed significance threshold. We present a conceptual model of how these retained genes interact through neurobiological pathways that may influence suicidal behavior, and identify existing drugs associated with these pathways that would not have been identified under traditional GWAS thresholds. We demonstrate GRIN's utility in boosting GWAS results by increasing the number of true positive genes identified from GWAS results.",Communications biology,2024,"Humans; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Suicide; Suicide, Attempted",False,1

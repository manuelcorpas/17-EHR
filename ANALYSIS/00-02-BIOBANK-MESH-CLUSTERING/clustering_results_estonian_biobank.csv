Estonian Biobank,22160497,Giving and withholding of information following genomic screening: challenges identified in a study of primary care physicians in Estonia.,"The use of predictive genomic information to improve medical care remains a contentious topic. However, it is generally agreed that the potential of genomics to improve medicine relies on medical care providers' ability to effectively communicate and put in context the meaning of test results. As the amount of information available increasingly outstrips providers' ability to offer qualified judgments on what the information means, consumers inevitably will be faced with test results of uncertain significance, as well as difficult questions about what they do or do not wish to know. Results of this survey of 64 primary care doctors in Estonia suggests that it may be inherently difficult for physicians to withhold genetic information obtained by genome scans or sequencing, even when they believe that having that information is not in the best interests of their patient. The descriptive data suggest introducing genomic medicine through primary care physicians, as proposed by the Estonian Genome Center of the University of Tartu, will require further genetics education as well as a carefully developed set of guidelines for determining where, when and how to use test results.",Journal of genetic counseling,2012,"Deception; Estonia; Genetic Testing; Humans; Physicians, Primary Care",False,9
Estonian Biobank,24097068,Discovery and refinement of loci associated with lipid levels.,"Levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol are heritable, modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease. To identify new loci and refine known loci influencing these lipids, we examined 188,577 individuals using genome-wide and custom genotyping arrays. We identify and annotate 157 loci associated with lipid levels at P < 5 × 10(-8), including 62 loci not previously associated with lipid levels in humans. Using dense genotyping in individuals of European, East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry, we narrow association signals in 12 loci. We find that loci associated with blood lipid levels are often associated with cardiovascular and metabolic traits, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, blood pressure, waist-hip ratio and body mass index. Our results demonstrate the value of using genetic data from individuals of diverse ancestry and provide insights into the biological mechanisms regulating blood lipids to guide future genetic, biological and therapeutic research.",Nature genetics,2013,"Asian People; Black People; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Coronary Artery Disease; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Lipids; Triglycerides; White People",False,5
Estonian Biobank,24013639,Systematic identification of trans eQTLs as putative drivers of known disease associations.,"Identifying the downstream effects of disease-associated SNPs is challenging. To help overcome this problem, we performed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) meta-analysis in non-transformed peripheral blood samples from 5,311 individuals with replication in 2,775 individuals. We identified and replicated trans eQTLs for 233 SNPs (reflecting 103 independent loci) that were previously associated with complex traits at genome-wide significance. Some of these SNPs affect multiple genes in trans that are known to be altered in individuals with disease: rs4917014, previously associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), altered gene expression of C1QB and five type I interferon response genes, both hallmarks of SLE. DeepSAGE RNA sequencing showed that rs4917014 strongly alters the 3' UTR levels of IKZF1 in cis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing analysis of the trans-regulated genes implicated IKZF1 as the causal gene. Variants associated with cholesterol metabolism and type 1 diabetes showed similar phenomena, indicating that large-scale eQTL mapping provides insight into the downstream effects of many trait-associated variants.",Nature genetics,2013,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci",False,7
Estonian Biobank,25079123,No evidence from genome-wide data of a Khazar origin for the Ashkenazi Jews.,"The origin and history of the Ashkenazi Jewish population have long been of great interest, and advances in high-throughput genetic analysis have recently provided a new approach for investigating these topics. We and others have argued on the basis of genome-wide data that the Ashkenazi Jewish population derives its ancestry from a combination of sources tracing to both Europe and the Middle East. It has been claimed, however, through a reanalysis of some of our data, that a large part of the ancestry of the Ashkenazi population originates with the Khazars, a Turkic-speaking group that lived to the north of the Caucasus region ~1,000 years ago. Because the Khazar population has left no obvious modern descendants that could enable a clear test for a contribution to Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, the Khazar hypothesis has been difficult to examine using genetics. Furthermore, because only limited genetic data have been available from the Caucasus region, and because these data have been concentrated in populations that are genetically close to populations from the Middle East, the attribution of any signal of Ashkenazi-Caucasus genetic similarity to Khazar ancestry rather than shared ancestral Middle Eastern ancestry has been problematic. Here, through integration of genotypes from newly collected samples with data from several of our past studies, we have assembled the largest data set available to date for assessment of Ashkenazi Jewish genetic origins. This data set contains genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 1,774 samples from 106 Jewish and non-Jewish populations that span the possible regions of potential Ashkenazi ancestry: Europe, the Middle East, and the region historically associated with the Khazar Khaganate. The data set includes 261 samples from 15 populations from the Caucasus region and the region directly to its north, samples that have not previously been included alongside Ashkenazi Jewish samples in genomic studies. Employing a variety of standard techniques for the analysis of population-genetic structure, we found that Ashkenazi Jews share the greatest genetic ancestry with other Jewish populations and, among non-Jewish populations, with groups from Europe and the Middle East. No particular similarity of Ashkenazi Jews to populations from the Caucasus is evident, particularly populations that most closely represent the Khazar region. Thus, analysis of Ashkenazi Jews together with a large sample from the region of the Khazar Khaganate corroborates the earlier results that Ashkenazi Jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the Middle East and Europe, that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other Jewish populations, and that there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within or from north of the Caucasus region.",Human biology,2013,"Ancient Lands; Europe; Female; Genetics, Population; Genome-Wide Association Study; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Jews; Male; Middle East; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,9
Estonian Biobank,23249956,Genetic characterization of northeastern Italian population isolates in the context of broader European genetic diversity.,"Population genetic studies on European populations have highlighted Italy as one of genetically most diverse regions. This is possibly due to the country's complex demographic history and large variability in terrain throughout the territory. This is the reason why Italy is enriched for population isolates, Sardinia being the best-known example. As the population isolates have a great potential in disease-causing genetic variants identification, we aimed to genetically characterize a region from northeastern Italy, which is known for isolated communities. Total of 1310 samples, collected from six geographically isolated villages, were genotyped at >145000 single-nucleotide polymorphism positions. Newly genotyped data were analyzed jointly with the available genome-wide data sets of individuals of European descent, including several population isolates. Despite the linguistic differences and geographical isolation the village populations still show the greatest genetic similarity to other Italian samples. The genetic isolation and small effective population size of the village populations is manifested by higher levels of genomic homozygosity and elevated linkage disequilibrium. These estimates become even more striking when the detected substructure is taken into account. The observed level of genetic isolation in Friuli-Venezia Giulia region is more extreme according to several measures of isolation compared with Sardinians, French Basques and northern Finns, thus proving the status of an isolate.",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2013,"Cluster Analysis; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome, Human; Homozygote; Humans; Italy; Linkage Disequilibrium; Models, Genetic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; White People",False,9
Estonian Biobank,25288136,Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies six novel loci associated with habitual coffee consumption.,"Coffee, a major dietary source of caffeine, is among the most widely consumed beverages in the world and has received considerable attention regarding health risks and benefits. We conducted a genome-wide (GW) meta-analysis of predominately regular-type coffee consumption (cups per day) among up to 91,462 coffee consumers of European ancestry with top single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) followed-up in ~30 062 and 7964 coffee consumers of European and African-American ancestry, respectively. Studies from both stages were combined in a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. Confirmed loci were examined for putative functional and biological relevance. Eight loci, including six novel loci, met GW significance (log10Bayes factor (BF)>5.64) with per-allele effect sizes of 0.03-0.14 cups per day. Six are located in or near genes potentially involved in pharmacokinetics (ABCG2, AHR, POR and CYP1A2) and pharmacodynamics (BDNF and SLC6A4) of caffeine. Two map to GCKR and MLXIPL genes related to metabolic traits but lacking known roles in coffee consumption. Enhancer and promoter histone marks populate the regions of many confirmed loci and several potential regulatory SNPs are highly correlated with the lead SNP of each. SNP alleles near GCKR, MLXIPL, BDNF and CYP1A2 that were associated with higher coffee consumption have previously been associated with smoking initiation, higher adiposity and fasting insulin and glucose but lower blood pressure and favorable lipid, inflammatory and liver enzyme profiles (P<5 × 10(-8)).Our genetic findings among European and African-American adults reinforce the role of caffeine in mediating habitual coffee consumption and may point to molecular mechanisms underlying inter-individual variability in pharmacological and health effects of coffee.",Molecular psychiatry,2015,"Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Coffea; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2; Feeding Behavior; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,7
Estonian Biobank,24518929,"Cohort Profile: Estonian Biobank of the Estonian Genome Center, University of Tartu.","The Estonian Biobank cohort is a volunteer-based sample of the Estonian resident adult population (aged ≥18 years). The current number of participants-close to 52000--represents a large proportion, 5%, of the Estonian adult population, making it ideally suited to population-based studies. General practitioners (GPs) and medical personnel in the special recruitment offices have recruited participants throughout the country. At baseline, the GPs performed a standardized health examination of the participants, who also donated blood samples for DNA, white blood cells and plasma tests and filled out a 16-module questionnaire on health-related topics such as lifestyle, diet and clinical diagnoses described in WHO ICD-10. A significant part of the cohort has whole genome sequencing (100), genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data (20 000) and/or NMR metabolome data (11 000) available (http://www.geenivaramu.ee/for-scientists/data-release/). The data are continuously updated through periodical linking to national electronic databases and registries. A part of the cohort has been re-contacted for follow-up purposes and resampling, and targeted invitations are possible for specific purposes, for example people with a specific diagnosis.

Estonian Biobank,24390342,Genetics of rheumatoid arthritis contributes to biology and drug discovery.,"A major challenge in human genetics is to devise a systematic strategy to integrate disease-associated variants with diverse genomic and biological data sets to provide insight into disease pathogenesis and guide drug discovery for complex traits such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here we performed a genome-wide association study meta-analysis in a total of >100,000 subjects of European and Asian ancestries (29,880 RA cases and 73,758 controls), by evaluating ∼10 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We discovered 42 novel RA risk loci at a genome-wide level of significance, bringing the total to 101 (refs 2 - 4). We devised an in silico pipeline using established bioinformatics methods based on functional annotation, cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci and pathway analyses--as well as novel methods based on genetic overlap with human primary immunodeficiency, haematological cancer somatic mutations and knockout mouse phenotypes--to identify 98 biological candidate genes at these 101 risk loci. We demonstrate that these genes are the targets of approved therapies for RA, and further suggest that drugs approved for other indications may be repurposed for the treatment of RA. Together, this comprehensive genetic study sheds light on fundamental genes, pathways and cell types that contribute to RA pathogenesis, and provides empirical evidence that the genetics of RA can provide important information for drug discovery.",Nature,2014,"Alleles; Animals; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Asian People; Case-Control Studies; Computational Biology; Drug Discovery; Drug Repositioning; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Hematologic Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; White People",False,7

After adjustment in multiple regression models and correction for multiple testing, from the 43 factors that were tested, only TPMT genotype (p = 1 × 10(-13)) and SAM levels (p = 1 × 10(-13)) were found to significantly influence TPMT activity. The influence of SAM on TPMT activity was more pronounced in TPMT-heterozygous than wild-type individuals.

Estonian Biobank,24743968,"Occupational irritants and asthma: an Estonian cross-sectional study of 34,000 adults.","Occupational exposures make important contributions to asthma morbidity. The role of low/moderate level irritant exposures remains unclear. We aimed to determine which occupational exposures are associated with asthma in an eastern European country with low asthma prevalence. The Estonian Genome Center of University of Tartu collected data from 50 077 adults in 2002-2011. Asthma was assessed through a questionnaire regarding diagnosed diseases, current health status and medication. Exposures to 22 agents during the current and longest held jobs were estimated using an asthma-specific job-exposure matrix. Analyses included 34 015 subjects (aged 18-65 years, 67.0% females), of which 1209 (3.6%) reported asthma (608 with physician-confirmed diagnosis). After adjusting for age, sex and smoking habits, lifetime occupational exposure to known asthmagens (20.4%) was significantly associated with physician-diagnosed asthma (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59), especially high molecular weight agents (flour: OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.31-4.27; animals: OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.00-2.60). Exposure to low/moderate levels of irritants (17.4%) was associated with physician-diagnosed asthma (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.48-2.37). More pronounced associations were observed in subjects reporting current treated asthma. Beyond confirming the effect of known asthmagens (which are well-known, mostly from observations in western countries), the results provide evidence for a role of low/moderate exposure to irritants. This finding, observed in a country with a low prevalence of asthma and atopy, provides new insight into the understanding of asthma heterogeneity.",The European respiratory journal,2014,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Asthma; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Databases, Factual; Estonia; Female; Health Status; Humans; Irritants; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Smoking; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",False,4
Estonian Biobank,24740359,Mapping the genetic architecture of gene regulation in whole blood.,"We aimed to assess whether whole blood expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with effects in cis and trans are robust and can be used to identify regulatory pathways affecting disease susceptibility. We performed whole-genome eQTL analyses in 890 participants of the KORA F4 study and in two independent replication samples (SHIP-TREND, N = 976 and EGCUT, N = 842) using linear regression models and Bonferroni correction. In the KORA F4 study, 4,116 cis-eQTLs (defined as SNP-probe pairs where the SNP is located within a 500 kb window around the transcription unit) and 94 trans-eQTLs reached genome-wide significance and overall 91% (92% of cis-, 84% of trans-eQTLs) were confirmed in at least one of the two replication studies. Different study designs including distinct laboratory reagents (PAXgene™ vs. Tempus™ tubes) did not affect reproducibility (separate overall replication overlap: 78% and 82%). Immune response pathways were enriched in cis- and trans-eQTLs and significant cis-eQTLs were partly coexistent in other tissues (cross-tissue similarity 40-70%). Furthermore, four chromosomal regions displayed simultaneous impact on multiple gene expression levels in trans, and 746 eQTL-SNPs have been previously reported to have clinical relevance. We demonstrated cross-associations between eQTL-SNPs, gene expression levels in trans, and clinical phenotypes as well as a link between eQTLs and human metabolic traits via modification of gene regulation in cis. Our data suggest that whole blood is a robust tissue for eQTL analysis and may be used both for biomarker studies and to enhance our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying gene-disease associations.",PloS one,2014,"Blood; Chromosome Mapping; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Markers; Humans; Linear Models; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci",False,7
Estonian Biobank,25543204,CDH13 promoter SNPs with pleiotropic effect on cardiometabolic parameters represent methylation QTLs.,"CDH13 encodes T-cadherin, a receptor for high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin and low-density lipoprotein, promoting proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Genome-wide association studies have mapped multiple variants in CDH13 associated with cardiometabolic traits (CMT) with variable effects across studies. We hypothesized that this heterogeneity might reflect interplay with DNA methylation within the region. Resequencing and EpiTYPER™ assay were applied for the HYPertension in ESTonia/Coronary Artery Disease in Czech (HYPEST/CADCZ; n = 358) samples to identify CDH13 promoter SNPs acting as methylation Quantitative Trait Loci (meQTLs) and to investigate their associations with CMT. In silico data were extracted from genome-wide DNA methylation and genotype datasets of the population-based sample Estonian Genome Center of the University of Tartu (EGCUT; n = 165). HYPEST-CADCZ meta-analysis identified a rare variant rs113460564 as highly significant meQTL for a 134-bp distant CpG site (P = 5.90 × 10(-6); β = 3.19%). Four common SNPs (rs12443878, rs12444338, rs62040565, rs8060301) exhibited effect on methylation level of up to 3 neighboring CpG sites in both datasets. The strongest association was detected in EGCUT between rs8060301 and cg09415485 (false discovery rate corrected P value = 1.89 × 10(-30)). Simultaneously, rs8060301 showed association with diastolic blood pressure, serum high-density lipoprotein and HMW adiponectin (P < 0.005). Novel strong associations were identified between rare CDH13 promoter meQTLs (minor allele frequency <5%) and HMW adiponectin: rs2239857 (P = 5.50 × 10(-5), β = -1,841.9 ng/mL) and rs77068073 (P = 2.67 × 10(-4), β = -2,484.4 ng/mL).

Estonian Biobank,25144627,A metabolic view on menopause and ageing.,"The ageing of the global population calls for a better understanding of age-related metabolic consequences. Here we report the effects of age, sex and menopause on serum metabolites in 26,065 individuals of Northern European ancestry. Age-specific metabolic fingerprints differ significantly by gender and, in females, a substantial atherogenic shift overlapping the time of menopausal transition is observed. In meta-analysis of 10,083 women, menopause status associates with amino acids glutamine, tyrosine and isoleucine, along with serum cholesterol measures and atherogenic lipoproteins. Among 3,204 women aged 40-55 years, menopause status associates additionally with glycine and total, monounsaturated, and omega-7 and -9 fatty acids. Our findings suggest that, in addition to lipid alterations, menopause may contribute to future metabolic and cardiovascular risk via influencing amino-acid concentrations, adding to the growing evidence of the importance of amino acids in metabolic disease progression.

Estonian Biobank,23989986,A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies novel variants associated with osteoarthritis of the hip.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis with a clear genetic component. To identify novel loci associated with hip OA we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on European subjects. We performed a two-stage meta-analysis on more than 78,000 participants. In stage 1, we synthesised data from eight GWAS whereas data from 10 centres were used for 'in silico' or 'de novo' replication. Besides the main analysis, a stratified by sex analysis was performed to detect possible sex-specific signals. Meta-analysis was performed using inverse-variance fixed effects models. A random effects approach was also used. We accumulated 11,277 cases of radiographic and symptomatic hip OA. We prioritised eight single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) for follow-up in the discovery stage (4349 OA cases); five from the combined analysis, two male specific and one female specific. One locus, at 20q13, represented by rs6094710 (minor allele frequency (MAF) 4%) near the NCOA3 (nuclear receptor coactivator 3) gene, reached genome-wide significance level with p=7.9×10(-9) and OR=1.28 (95% CI 1.18 to 1.39) in the combined analysis of discovery (p=5.6×10(-8)) and follow-up studies (p=7.3×10(-4)). We showed that this gene is expressed in articular cartilage and its expression was significantly reduced in OA-affected cartilage. Moreover, two loci remained suggestive associated; rs5009270 at 7q31 (MAF 30%, p=9.9×10(-7), OR=1.10) and rs3757837 at 7p13 (MAF 6%, p=2.2×10(-6), OR=1.27 in male specific analysis).

The study included 1963 patients with incident cancer of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx or esophagus and 1993 controls. Subjects were interviewed about their oral health and dental care behaviors (which were converted to scores of OH and DC respectively), as well as smoking, alcohol drinking, diet, occupations, medical conditions and socio-economic status. Blood samples were taken for genetic analyses. Mouthwash use was analyzed in relation to the presence of polymorphisms of alcohol-metabolizing genes known to be associated with UADT. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95%-confidence intervals [CI] were estimated with multiple logistic regression models adjusting for multiple confounders. Fully adjusted ORs of low versus high scores of DC and OH were 2.36[CI=1.51-3.67] and 2.22[CI=1.45-3.41], respectively, for all UADT sites combined. The OR for frequent use of mouthwash use (3 or more times/day) was 3.23[CI=1.68-6.19]. The OR for the rare variant ADH7 (coding for fast ethanol metabolism) was lower in mouthwash-users (OR=0.53[CI=0.35-0.81]) as compared to never-users (OR=0.97[CI=0.73-1.29]) indicating effect modification (pheterogeneity=0.065) while no relevant differences were observed between users and non-users for the variant alleles of ADH1B, ADH1C or ALDH2. Poor OH and DC seem to be independent risk factors for UADT because corresponding risk estimates remain substantially elevated after detailed adjustment for multiple confounders.

Estonian Biobank,25287667,Replicability and robustness of genome-wide-association studies for behavioral traits.,"A recent genome-wide-association study of educational attainment identified three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) whose associations, despite their small effect sizes (each R (2) ≈ 0.02%), reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10(-8)) in a large discovery sample and were replicated in an independent sample (p < .05). The study also reported associations between educational attainment and indices of SNPs called ""polygenic scores."" In three studies, we evaluated the robustness of these findings. Study 1 showed that the associations with all three SNPs were replicated in another large (N = 34,428) independent sample. We also found that the scores remained predictive (R (2) ≈ 2%) in regressions with stringent controls for stratification (Study 2) and in new within-family analyses (Study 3). Our results show that large and therefore well-powered genome-wide-association studies can identify replicable genetic associations with behavioral traits. The small effect sizes of individual SNPs are likely to be a major contributing factor explaining the striking contrast between our results and the disappointing replication record of most candidate-gene studies.",Psychological science,2014,"Achievement; Educational Status; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Massachusetts; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Principal Component Analysis; Queensland; Registries; Reproducibility of Results",False,7
Estonian Biobank,25261970,"DataSHIELD: taking the analysis to the data, not the data to the analysis.","Research in modern biomedicine and social science requires sample sizes so large that they can often only be achieved through a pooled co-analysis of data from several studies. But the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. In the UK this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the UK's proposed 'care.data' initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. DataSHIELD provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data. Commands are sent from a central analysis computer (AC) to several data computers (DCs) storing the data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. The separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the DCs and the AC. This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC. Based on this Opal/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach. DataSHIELD facilitates important research in settings where: (i) a co-analysis of individual-level data from several studies is scientifically necessary but governance restrictions prohibit the release or sharing of some of the required data, and/or render data access unacceptably slow; (ii) a research group (e.g. in a developing nation) is particularly vulnerable to loss of intellectual property-the researchers want to fully share the information held in their data with national and international collaborators, but do not wish to hand over the physical data themselves; and (iii) a data set is to be included in an individual-level co-analysis but the physical size of the data precludes direct transfer to a new site for analysis.",International journal of epidemiology,2014,"Biomedical Research; Computational Biology; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Databases, Factual; Datasets as Topic; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; United Kingdom",False,1

Estonian Biobank,24361469,Identifying flavor preference subgroups. Genetic basis and related eating behavior traits.,"Subgroups based on flavor preferences were identified and their genetic and behavior related characteristics investigated using extensive data from 331 Finnish twins (21-25years, 146 men) including 47 monozygotic (MZ) and 93 dizygotic (DZ) pairs, and 51 twin individuals. The subgroup identification (hierarchical and K-means clustering) was based on liking responses to food names representing sour, umami, and spicy flavor qualities. Furthermore, sensory tests were conducted, a questionnaire on food likes completed, and various eating behavior related traits measured with validated scales. Sensory data included intensity ratings of PROP (6-n-propylthiouracil-impregnated filter paper), hedonic and intensity responses to sourness (orange juice with and without added citric acid, 0.42%), pungency (strawberry jelly with and without added capsaicin 0.00013%) and umami ('mouthfeel flavor' taste solution). Ratings of liking of 41 general food names were categorized into salty-and-fatty, sweet-and-fatty, fruits and vegetables and fish foods. Subgroup differences (complex samples procedure) and the genetics underlying the subgroups (structural equation modeling) were investigated. Of the resulting two groups (basic, n=140, adventurous n=152; non-grouped n=39), the adventurous expressed higher liking for sour and spicy foods, and had more tolerance for capsaicin burn in the sensory-hedonic test. The adventurous were also less food neophobic (25.9±9.1 vs. 32.5±10.6, respectively) and expressed higher liking for fruits and vegetables compared to the basic group. Genetic effects were shown to underlie the subgroups (heritability 72%, CI: 36-92%). Linkage analysis for 27 candidate gene regions revealed suggestively that being adventurous is linked to TAS1R1 and PKD1L3 genes. These results indicate that food neophobia and genetic differences may form a barrier through which individual flavor preferences are generated.",Appetite,2014,"Adult; Feeding Behavior; Female; Finland; Food Preferences; Fruit; Humans; Male; Phenotype; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taste; Twins; Vegetables; White People; Young Adult",False,4
Estonian Biobank,24296717,Impact of type 2 diabetes susceptibility variants on quantitative glycemic traits reveals mechanistic heterogeneity.,"Patients with established type 2 diabetes display both β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. To define fundamental processes leading to the diabetic state, we examined the relationship between type 2 diabetes risk variants at 37 established susceptibility loci, and indices of proinsulin processing, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity. We included data from up to 58,614 nondiabetic subjects with basal measures and 17,327 with dynamic measures. We used additive genetic models with adjustment for sex, age, and BMI, followed by fixed-effects, inverse-variance meta-analyses. Cluster analyses grouped risk loci into five major categories based on their relationship to these continuous glycemic phenotypes. The first cluster (PPARG, KLF14, IRS1, GCKR) was characterized by primary effects on insulin sensitivity. The second cluster (MTNR1B, GCK) featured risk alleles associated with reduced insulin secretion and fasting hyperglycemia. ARAP1 constituted a third cluster characterized by defects in insulin processing. A fourth cluster (TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX/IDE, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B) was defined by loci influencing insulin processing and secretion without a detectable change in fasting glucose levels. The final group contained 20 risk loci with no clear-cut associations to continuous glycemic traits. By assembling extensive data on continuous glycemic traits, we have exposed the diverse mechanisms whereby type 2 diabetes risk variants impact disease predisposition.",Diabetes,2014,"Alleles; Cluster Analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Insulin Secretion; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Risk Factors; Transcription Factors",False,2
Estonian Biobank,24572353,Detection and replication of epistasis influencing transcription in humans.,"Epistasis is the phenomenon whereby one polymorphism's effect on a trait depends on other polymorphisms present in the genome. The extent to which epistasis influences complex traits and contributes to their variation is a fundamental question in evolution and human genetics. Although often demonstrated in artificial gene manipulation studies in model organisms, and some examples have been reported in other species, few examples exist for epistasis among natural polymorphisms in human traits. Its absence from empirical findings may simply be due to low incidence in the genetic control of complex traits, but an alternative view is that it has previously been too technically challenging to detect owing to statistical and computational issues. Here we show, using advanced computation and a gene expression study design, that many instances of epistasis are found between common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In a cohort of 846 individuals with 7,339 gene expression levels measured in peripheral blood, we found 501 significant pairwise interactions between common SNPs influencing the expression of 238 genes (P < 2.91 × 10(-16)). Replication of these interactions in two independent data sets showed both concordance of direction of epistatic effects (P = 5.56 × 10(-31)) and enrichment of interaction P values, with 30 being significant at a conservative threshold of P < 9.98 × 10(-5). Forty-four of the genetic interactions are located within 5 megabases of regions of known physical chromosome interactions (P = 1.8 × 10(-10)). Epistatic networks of three SNPs or more influence the expression levels of 129 genes, whereby one cis-acting SNP is modulated by several trans-acting SNPs. For example, MBNL1 is influenced by an additive effect at rs13069559, which itself is masked by trans-SNPs on 14 different chromosomes, with nearly identical genotype-phenotype maps for each cis-trans interaction. This study presents the first evidence, to our knowledge, for many instances of segregating common polymorphisms interacting to influence human traits.",Nature,2014,"Cohort Studies; Epistasis, Genetic; Europe; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Association Studies; Humans; Linkage Disequilibrium; Male; Pedigree; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Reproducibility of Results; Transcription, Genetic",False,7
Estonian Biobank,24514567,A genome-wide association study of anorexia nervosa.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex and heritable eating disorder characterized by dangerously low body weight. Neither candidate gene studies nor an initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) have yielded significant and replicated results. We performed a GWAS in 2907 cases with AN from 14 countries (15 sites) and 14 860 ancestrally matched controls as part of the Genetic Consortium for AN (GCAN) and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 3 (WTCCC3). Individual association analyses were conducted in each stratum and meta-analyzed across all 15 discovery data sets. Seventy-six (72 independent) single nucleotide polymorphisms were taken forward for in silico (two data sets) or de novo (13 data sets) replication genotyping in 2677 independent AN cases and 8629 European ancestry controls along with 458 AN cases and 421 controls from Japan. The final global meta-analysis across discovery and replication data sets comprised 5551 AN cases and 21 080 controls. AN subtype analyses (1606 AN restricting; 1445 AN binge-purge) were performed. No findings reached genome-wide significance. Two intronic variants were suggestively associated: rs9839776 (P=3.01 × 10(-7)) in SOX2OT and rs17030795 (P=5.84 × 10(-6)) in PPP3CA. Two additional signals were specific to Europeans: rs1523921 (P=5.76 × 10(-)(6)) between CUL3 and FAM124B and rs1886797 (P=8.05 × 10(-)(6)) near SPATA13. Comparing discovery with replication results, 76% of the effects were in the same direction, an observation highly unlikely to be due to chance (P=4 × 10(-6)), strongly suggesting that true findings exist but our sample, the largest yet reported, was underpowered for their detection.

Here, we analyse genetic association data on biochemical markers of iron status from 11 European-population studies, with replication in eight additional cohorts (total up to 48,972 subjects). We find 11 genome-wide-significant (P<5 × 10(-8)) loci, some including known iron-related genes (HFE, SLC40A1, TF, TFR2, TFRC, TMPRSS6) and others novel (ABO, ARNTL, FADS2, NAT2, TEX14). SNPs at ARNTL, TF, and TFR2 affect iron markers in HFE C282Y homozygotes at risk for hemochromatosis.

Estonian Biobank,25057126,Meta-analysis identifies loci affecting levels of the potential osteoarthritis biomarkers sCOMP and uCTX-II with genome wide significance.,"Research for the use of biomarkers in osteoarthritis (OA) is promising, however, adequate discrimination between patients and controls may be hampered due to innate differences. We set out to identify loci influencing levels of serum cartilage oligomeric protein (sCOMP) and urinary C-telopeptide of type II collagen (uCTX-II). Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies was applied to standardised residuals of sCOMP (N=3316) and uCTX-II (N=4654) levels available in 6 and 7 studies, respectively, from TreatOA. Effects were estimated using a fixed-effects model. Six promising signals were followed up by de novo genotyping in the Cohort Hip and Cohort Knee study (N = 964). Subsequently, their role in OA susceptibility was investigated in large-scale genome-wide association studies meta-analyses for OA. Differential expression of annotated genes was assessed in cartilage. Genome-wide significant association with sCOMP levels was found for a SNP within MRC1 (rs691461, p = 1.7 × 10(-12)) and a SNP within CSMD1 associated with variation in uCTX-II levels with borderline genome-wide significance (rs1983474, p = 8.5 × 10(-8)). Indication for association with sCOMP levels was also found for a locus close to the COMP gene itself (rs10038, p = 7.1 × 10(-6)). The latter SNP was subsequently found to be associated with hip OA whereas COMP expression appeared responsive to the OA pathophysiology in cartilage. We have identified genetic loci affecting either uCTX-II or sCOMP levels. The genome wide significant association of MRC1 with sCOMP levels was found likely to act independent of OA subtypes. Increased sensitivity of biomarkers with OA may be accomplished by taking genetic variation into account.",Journal of medical genetics,2014,"Biomarkers; Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein; Collagen Type II; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Membrane Glycoproteins; Membrane Proteins; Osteoarthritis; Peptide Fragments; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, Immunologic; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",False,2
Estonian Biobank,24560518,A common 16p11.2 inversion underlies the joint susceptibility to asthma and obesity.,"The prevalence of asthma and obesity is increasing worldwide, and obesity is a well-documented risk factor for asthma. The mechanisms underlying this association and parallel time trends remain largely unknown but genetic factors may be involved. Here, we report on a common ~0.45 Mb genomic inversion at 16p11.2 that can be accurately genotyped via SNP array data. We show that the inversion allele protects against the joint occurrence of asthma and obesity in five large independent studies (combined sample size of 317 cases and 543 controls drawn from a total of 5,809 samples; combined OR = 0.48, p = 5.5 × 10(-6)). Allele frequencies show remarkable worldwide population stratification, ranging from 10% in East Africa to 49% in Northern Europe, consistent with discordant and extreme genetic drifts or adaptive selections after human migration out of Africa. Inversion alleles strongly correlate with expression levels of neighboring genes, especially TUFM (p = 3.0 × 10(-40)) that encodes a mitochondrial protein regulator of energy balance and inhibitor of type 1 interferon, and other candidates for asthma (IL27) and obesity (APOB48R and SH2B1). Therefore, by affecting gene expression, the ~0.45 Mb 16p11.2 inversion provides a genetic basis for the joint susceptibility to asthma and obesity, with a population attributable risk of 39.7%. Differential mitochondrial function and basal energy balance of inversion alleles might also underlie the potential selection signature that led to their uneven distribution in world populations.",American journal of human genetics,2014,"Adult; Algorithms; Alleles; Asthma; Chromosome Inversion; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16; Cohort Studies; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetics, Population; Genome, Human; Genotype; Haplotypes; Humans; Male; Obesity; Odds Ratio; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,9
Estonian Biobank,24586121,"Biomarker profiling by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for the prediction of all-cause mortality: an observational study of 17,345 persons.","Early identification of ambulatory persons at high short-term risk of death could benefit targeted prevention. To identify biomarkers for all-cause mortality and enhance risk prediction, we conducted high-throughput profiling of blood specimens in two large population-based cohorts. 106 candidate biomarkers were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of non-fasting plasma samples from a random subset of the Estonian Biobank (n = 9,842; age range 18-103 y; 508 deaths during a median of 5.4 y of follow-up). Biomarkers for all-cause mortality were examined using stepwise proportional hazards models. Significant biomarkers were validated and incremental predictive utility assessed in a population-based cohort from Finland (n = 7,503; 176 deaths during 5 y of follow-up). Four circulating biomarkers predicted the risk of all-cause mortality among participants from the Estonian Biobank after adjusting for conventional risk factors: alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (hazard ratio [HR] 1.67 per 1-standard deviation increment, 95% CI 1.53-1.82, p = 5×10⁻³¹), albumin (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.65-0.76, p = 2×10⁻¹⁸), very-low-density lipoprotein particle size (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.62-0.77, p = 3×10⁻¹²), and citrate (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.21-1.45, p = 5×10⁻¹⁰). All four biomarkers were predictive of cardiovascular mortality, as well as death from cancer and other nonvascular diseases. One in five participants in the Estonian Biobank cohort with a biomarker summary score within the highest percentile died during the first year of follow-up, indicating prominent systemic reflections of frailty. The biomarker associations all replicated in the Finnish validation cohort. Including the four biomarkers in a risk prediction score improved risk assessment for 5-y mortality (increase in C-statistics 0.031, p = 0.01; continuous reclassification improvement 26.3%, p = 0.001). Biomarker associations with cardiovascular, nonvascular, and cancer mortality suggest novel systemic connectivities across seemingly disparate morbidities. The biomarker profiling improved prediction of the short-term risk of death from all causes above established risk factors. Further investigations are needed to clarify the biological mechanisms and the utility of these biomarkers for guiding screening and prevention.",PLoS medicine,2014,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biological Specimen Banks; Biomarkers; Cause of Death; Citric Acid; Estonia; Female; Finland; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lipoproteins, LDL; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Orosomucoid; Particle Size; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Serum Albumin; Serum Albumin, Human; Time Factors; Young Adult",False,4

Estonian Biobank,24497844,High risk population isolate reveals low frequency variants predisposing to intracranial aneurysms.,"3% of the population develops saccular intracranial aneurysms (sIAs), a complex trait, with a sporadic and a familial form. Subarachnoid hemorrhage from sIA (sIA-SAH) is a devastating form of stroke. Certain rare genetic variants are enriched in the Finns, a population isolate with a small founder population and bottleneck events. As the sIA-SAH incidence in Finland is >2× increased, such variants may associate with sIA in the Finnish population. We tested 9.4 million variants for association in 760 Finnish sIA patients (enriched for familial sIA), and in 2,513 matched controls with case-control status and with the number of sIAs. The most promising loci (p<5E-6) were replicated in 858 Finnish sIA patients and 4,048 controls. The frequencies and effect sizes of the replicated variants were compared to a continental European population using 717 Dutch cases and 3,004 controls. We discovered four new high-risk loci with low frequency lead variants. Three were associated with the case-control status: 2q23.3 (MAF 2.1%, OR 1.89, p 1.42×10-9); 5q31.3 (MAF 2.7%, OR 1.66, p 3.17×10-8); 6q24.2 (MAF 2.6%, OR 1.87, p 1.87×10-11) and one with the number of sIAs: 7p22.1 (MAF 3.3%, RR 1.59, p 6.08×-9). Two of the associations (5q31.3, 6q24.2) replicated in the Dutch sample. The 7p22.1 locus was strongly differentiated; the lead variant was more frequent in Finland (4.6%) than in the Netherlands (0.3%). Additionally, we replicated a previously inconclusive locus on 2q33.1 in all samples tested (OR 1.27, p 1.87×10-12). The five loci explain 2.1% of the sIA heritability in Finland, and may relate to, but not explain, the increased incidence of sIA-SAH in Finland.

Experimental studies in animals suggest the potential roles of FTO in regulating food intake. The interactive relation among FTO variants, dietary intake and body mass index (BMI) is complex and results from previous often small-scale studies in humans are highly inconsistent. We performed large-scale analyses based on data from 177,330 adults (154 439 Whites, 5776 African Americans and 17 115 Asians) from 40 studies to examine: (i) the association between the FTO-rs9939609 variant (or a proxy single-nucleotide polymorphism) and total energy and macronutrient intake and (ii) the interaction between the FTO variant and dietary intake on BMI. The minor allele (A-allele) of the FTO-rs9939609 variant was associated with higher BMI in Whites (effect per allele = 0.34 [0.31, 0.37] kg/m(2), P = 1.9 × 10(-105)), and all participants (0.30 [0.30, 0.35] kg/m(2), P = 3.6 × 10(-107)). The BMI-increasing allele of the FTO variant showed a significant association with higher dietary protein intake (effect per allele = 0.08 [0.06, 0.10] %, P = 2.4 × 10(-16)), and relative weak associations with lower total energy intake (-6.4 [-10.1, -2.6] kcal/day, P = 0.001) and lower dietary carbohydrate intake (-0.07 [-0.11, -0.02] %, P = 0.004). The associations with protein (P = 7.5 × 10(-9)) and total energy (P = 0.002) were attenuated but remained significant after adjustment for BMI. We did not find significant interactions between the FTO variant and dietary intake of total energy, protein, carbohydrate or fat on BMI.

Estonian Biobank,25055923,Comprehensive meta-analysis of microRNA expression using a robust rank aggregation approach.,"Differential microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling by high-throughput methods has generated a vast amount of information about the complex role of these small regulatory molecules in a broad spectrum of human diseases. However, the results of such studies are often inconsistent, mostly due to the lack of cross-platform standardization, ongoing discovery of novel miRNAs, and small sample size. Therefore, a critical and systematic analysis of all available information is essential for successful identification of the most relevant miRNAs. Meta-analysis approach allows integrating the results from several independent studies in order to achieve greater statistical power and estimate the variability between the studies. Here we describe as an example the use of a robust rank aggregation (RRA) method for identification of miRNA meta-signature in lung cancer. This method analyzes prioritized gene lists and finds commonly overlapping genes, which are ranked consistently better than expected by chance. An RRA approach not only helps to prioritize the putative targets for further experimental studies but also highlights the challenges related with the development of miRNA-based tests and emphasizes the need for rigorous evaluation of the results before proceeding to clinical trials.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2014,"Animals; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; MicroRNAs",False,7
Estonian Biobank,25327560,Population distribution and ancestry of the cancer protective MDM2 SNP285 (rs117039649).,"The MDM2 promoter SNP285C is located on the SNP309G allele. While SNP309G enhances Sp1 transcription factor binding and MDM2 transcription, SNP285C antagonizes Sp1 binding and reduces the risk of breast-, ovary- and endometrial cancer. Assessing SNP285 and 309 genotypes across 25 different ethnic populations (>10.000 individuals), the incidence of SNP285C was 6-8% across European populations except for Finns (1.2%) and Saami (0.3%). The incidence decreased towards the Middle-East and Eastern Russia, and SNP285C was absent among Han Chinese, Mongolians and African Americans. Interhaplotype variation analyses estimated SNP285C to have originated about 14,700 years ago (95% CI: 8,300 - 33,300). Both this estimate and the geographical distribution suggest SNP285C to have arisen after the separation between Caucasians and modern day East Asians (17,000 - 40,000 years ago). We observed a strong inverse correlation (r = -0.805; p < 0.001) between the percentage of SNP309G alleles harboring SNP285C and the MAF for SNP309G itself across different populations suggesting selection and environmental adaptation with respect to MDM2 expression in recent human evolution.

Estonian Biobank,24425829,Leukocyte telomere length associates with prospective mortality independent of immune-related parameters and known genetic markers.,"Human leukocyte telomere length (LTL) decreases with age and shorter LTL has previously been associated with increased prospective mortality. However, it is not clear whether LTL merely marks the health status of an individual by its association with parameters of immune function, for example, or whether telomere shortening also contributes causally to lifespan variation in humans. We measured LTL in 870 nonagenarian siblings (mean age 93 years), 1580 of their offspring and 725 spouses thereof (mean age 59 years) from the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS). We found that shorter LTL is associated with increased prospective mortality in middle (30-80 years; hazard ratio (HR)=0.75, P=0.001) and highly advanced age (≥90 years; HR=0.92, P=0.028), and show that this association cannot be explained by the association of LTL with the immune-related markers insulin-like growth factor 1 to insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 molar ratio, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, cytomegalovirus serostatus or white blood cell counts. We found no difference in LTL between the middle-aged LLS offspring and their spouses (β=0.006, P=0.932). Neither did we observe an association of LTL-associated genetic variants with mortality in a prospective meta-analysis of multiple cohorts (n=8165). We confirm LTL to be a marker of prospective mortality in middle and highly advanced age and additionally show that this association could not be explained by the association of LTL with various immune-related markers.

Utilizing CPAS to restrict the GWAS input variants to only those differing in frequency between the two populations, we identify novel Amerindian lipid genes, receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (RORA) and salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3), and three loci previously unassociated with dyslipidemia or obesity. We also detect lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) harbouring specific Amerindian signatures of risk variants and haplotypes. Notably, we observe that SIK3 and one novel lipid locus underwent positive selection in Mexicans. Furthermore, after a high-fat meal, the SIK3 risk variant carriers display high triglyceride levels.

Estonian Biobank,25231870,Parent-of-origin-specific allelic associations among 106 genomic loci for age at menarche.,"Age at menarche is a marker of timing of puberty in females. It varies widely between individuals, is a heritable trait and is associated with risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and all-cause mortality. Studies of rare human disorders of puberty and animal models point to a complex hypothalamic-pituitary-hormonal regulation, but the mechanisms that determine pubertal timing and underlie its links to disease risk remain unclear. Here, using genome-wide and custom-genotyping arrays in up to 182,416 women of European descent from 57 studies, we found robust evidence (P < 5 × 10(-8)) for 123 signals at 106 genomic loci associated with age at menarche. Many loci were associated with other pubertal traits in both sexes, and there was substantial overlap with genes implicated in body mass index and various diseases, including rare disorders of puberty. Menarche signals were enriched in imprinted regions, with three loci (DLK1-WDR25, MKRN3-MAGEL2 and KCNK9) demonstrating parent-of-origin-specific associations concordant with known parental expression patterns. Pathway analyses implicated nuclear hormone receptors, particularly retinoic acid and γ-aminobutyric acid-B2 receptor signalling, among novel mechanisms that regulate pubertal timing in humans. Our findings suggest a genetic architecture involving at least hundreds of common variants in the coordinated timing of the pubertal transition.",Nature,2014,"Adolescent; Age Factors; Alleles; Body Mass Index; Breast Neoplasms; Calcium-Binding Proteins; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Europe; Female; Genetic Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomic Imprinting; Humans; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Male; Membrane Proteins; Menarche; Obesity; Ovary; Parents; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Potassium Channels, Tandem Pore Domain; Proteins; Quantitative Trait Loci; Receptors, GABA-B; Receptors, Retinoic Acid; Ribonucleoproteins; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases",False,6
Estonian Biobank,24688116,Genome-wide association meta-analysis of human longevity identifies a novel locus conferring survival beyond 90 years of age.,"The genetic contribution to the variation in human lifespan is ∼ 25%. Despite the large number of identified disease-susceptibility loci, it is not known which loci influence population mortality. We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 7729 long-lived individuals of European descent (≥ 85 years) and 16 121 younger controls (<65 years) followed by replication in an additional set of 13 060 long-lived individuals and 61 156 controls. In addition, we performed a subset analysis in cases aged ≥ 90 years. We observed genome-wide significant association with longevity, as reflected by survival to ages beyond 90 years, at a novel locus, rs2149954, on chromosome 5q33.3 (OR = 1.10, P = 1.74 × 10(-8)). We also confirmed association of rs4420638 on chromosome 19q13.32 (OR = 0.72, P = 3.40 × 10(-36)), representing the TOMM40/APOE/APOC1 locus. In a prospective meta-analysis (n = 34 103), the minor allele of rs2149954 (T) on chromosome 5q33.3 associates with increased survival (HR = 0.95, P = 0.003). This allele has previously been reported to associate with low blood pressure in middle age. Interestingly, the minor allele (T) associates with decreased cardiovascular mortality risk, independent of blood pressure. We report on the first GWAS-identified longevity locus on chromosome 5q33.3 influencing survival in the general European population. The minor allele of this locus associates with low blood pressure in middle age, although the contribution of this allele to survival may be less dependent on blood pressure. Hence, the pleiotropic mechanisms by which this intragenic variation contributes to lifespan regulation have to be elucidated.",Human molecular genetics,2014,"Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiovascular Diseases; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5; Female; Genetic Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Hypertension; Longevity; Male; Phenotype; Prospective Studies; White People",False,6
Estonian Biobank,24256729,Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans.,"The origins of the First Americans remain contentious. Although Native Americans seem to be genetically most closely related to east Asians, there is no consensus with regard to which specific Old World populations they are closest to. Here we sequence the draft genome of an approximately 24,000-year-old individual (MA-1), from Mal'ta in south-central Siberia, to an average depth of 1×. To our knowledge this is the oldest anatomically modern human genome reported to date. The MA-1 mitochondrial genome belongs to haplogroup U, which has also been found at high frequency among Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers, and the Y chromosome of MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and near the root of most Native American lineages. Similarly, we find autosomal evidence that MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and genetically closely related to modern-day Native Americans, with no close affinity to east Asians. This suggests that populations related to contemporary western Eurasians had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought. Furthermore, we estimate that 14 to 38% of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population. This is likely to have occurred after the divergence of Native American ancestors from east Asian ancestors, but before the diversification of Native American populations in the New World. Gene flow from the MA-1 lineage into Native American ancestors could explain why several crania from the First Americans have been reported as bearing morphological characteristics that do not resemble those of east Asians. Sequencing of another south-central Siberian, Afontova Gora-2 dating to approximately 17,000 years ago, revealed similar autosomal genetic signatures as MA-1, suggesting that the region was continuously occupied by humans throughout the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings reveal that western Eurasian genetic signatures in modern-day Native Americans derive not only from post-Columbian admixture, as commonly thought, but also from a mixed ancestry of the First Americans.",Nature,2014,"Animals; Asia; Asian People; Chromosomes, Human, Y; DNA, Mitochondrial; Emigration and Immigration; Gene Flow; Genome, Human; Genome, Mitochondrial; Haplotypes; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Phylogeny; Phylogeography; Siberia; Skeleton; White People",False,9
Estonian Biobank,25201988,Common genetic variants associated with cognitive performance identified using the proxy-phenotype method.,"We identify common genetic variants associated with cognitive performance using a two-stage approach, which we call the proxy-phenotype method. First, we conduct a genome-wide association study of educational attainment in a large sample (n = 106,736), which produces a set of 69 education-associated SNPs. Second, using independent samples (n = 24,189), we measure the association of these education-associated SNPs with cognitive performance. Three SNPs (rs1487441, rs7923609, and rs2721173) are significantly associated with cognitive performance after correction for multiple hypothesis testing. In an independent sample of older Americans (n = 8,652), we also show that a polygenic score derived from the education-associated SNPs is associated with memory and absence of dementia. Convergent evidence from a set of bioinformatics analyses implicates four specific genes (KNCMA1, NRXN1, POU2F3, and SCRT). All of these genes are associated with a particular neurotransmitter pathway involved in synaptic plasticity, the main cellular mechanism for learning and memory.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2014,"Calcium-Binding Proteins; Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal; Cognition; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Memory; Multifactorial Inheritance; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules; Neuronal Plasticity; Octamer Transcription Factors; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Synaptic Transmission",False,7
Estonian Biobank,24727021,Copper metabolism domain-containing 1 represses genes that promote inflammation and protects mice from colitis and colitis-associated cancer.,"Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) has been associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Copper metabolism MURR1 domain containing 1 (COMMD1), a regulator of various transport pathways, has been shown to limit NF-κB activation. We investigated the roles of COMMD1 in the pathogenesis of colitis in mice and IBD in human beings. We created mice with a specific disruption of Commd1 in myeloid cells (Mye-knockout [K/O] mice); we analyzed immune cell populations and functions and expression of genes regulated by NF-κB. Sepsis was induced in Mye-K/O and wild-type mice by cecal ligation and puncture or intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), colitis was induced by administration of dextran sodium sulfate, and colitis-associated cancer was induced by administration of dextran sodium sulfate and azoxymethane. We measured levels of COMMD1 messenger RNA in colon biopsy specimens from 29 patients with IBD and 16 patients without (controls), and validated findings in an independent cohort (17 patients with IBD and 22 controls). We searched for polymorphisms in or near COMMD1 that were associated with IBD using data from the International IBD Genetics Consortium and performed quantitative trait locus analysis. In comparing gene expression patterns between myeloid cells from Mye-K/O and wild-type mice, we found that COMMD1 represses expression of genes induced by LPS. Mye-K/O mice had more intense inflammatory responses to LPS and developed more severe sepsis and colitis, with greater mortality. More Mye-K/O mice with colitis developed colon dysplasia and tumors than wild-type mice. We observed a reduced expression of COMMD1 in colon biopsy specimens and circulating leukocytes from patients with IBD. We associated single-nucleotide variants near COMMD1 with reduced expression of the gene and linked them with increased risk for ulcerative colitis. Expression of COMMD1 by myeloid cells has anti-inflammatory effects.

Estonian Biobank,25078778,Distribution and medical impact of loss-of-function variants in the Finnish founder population.,"Exome sequencing studies in complex diseases are challenged by the allelic heterogeneity, large number and modest effect sizes of associated variants on disease risk and the presence of large numbers of neutral variants, even in phenotypically relevant genes. Isolated populations with recent bottlenecks offer advantages for studying rare variants in complex diseases as they have deleterious variants that are present at higher frequencies as well as a substantial reduction in rare neutral variation. To explore the potential of the Finnish founder population for studying low-frequency (0.5-5%) variants in complex diseases, we compared exome sequence data on 3,000 Finns to the same number of non-Finnish Europeans and discovered that, despite having fewer variable sites overall, the average Finn has more low-frequency loss-of-function variants and complete gene knockouts. We then used several well-characterized Finnish population cohorts to study the phenotypic effects of 83 enriched loss-of-function variants across 60 phenotypes in 36,262 Finns. Using a deep set of quantitative traits collected on these cohorts, we show 5 associations (p<5×10⁻⁸) including splice variants in LPA that lowered plasma lipoprotein(a) levels (P = 1.5×10⁻¹¹⁷). Through accessing the national medical records of these participants, we evaluate the LPA finding via Mendelian randomization and confirm that these splice variants confer protection from cardiovascular disease (OR = 0.84, P = 3×10⁻⁴), demonstrating for the first time the correlation between very low levels of LPA in humans with potential therapeutic implications for cardiovascular diseases. More generally, this study articulates substantial advantages for studying the role of rare variation in complex phenotypes in founder populations like the Finns and by combining a unique population genetic history with data from large population cohorts and centralized research access to National Health Registers.",PLoS genetics,2014,"Exome; Female; Finland; Founder Effect; Gene Frequency; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; Genetic Drift; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Phenotype; White People",False,9

GRB10 is a negative regulator of insulin signaling and imprinted in a parent-of-origin fashion in different tissues. GRB10 knock-down in human pancreatic islets showed reduced insulin and glucagon secretion, which together with changes in insulin sensitivity may explain the paradoxical reduction of glucose despite a decrease in insulin secretion. Together, these findings suggest that tissue-specific methylation and possibly imprinting of GRB10 can influence glucose metabolism and contribute to T2D pathogenesis. The data also emphasize the need in genetic studies to consider whether risk alleles are inherited from the mother or the father.",PLoS genetics,2014,"Alleles; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fasting; GRB10 Adaptor Protein; Genome-Wide Association Study; Glucose; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Islets of Langerhans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptor, Insulin; Signal Transduction",False,0
Estonian Biobank,25474530,"Mediation analysis demonstrates that trans-eQTLs are often explained by cis-mediation: a genome-wide analysis among 1,800 South Asians.","A large fraction of human genes are regulated by genetic variation near the transcribed sequence (cis-eQTL, expression quantitative trait locus), and many cis-eQTLs have implications for human disease. Less is known regarding the effects of genetic variation on expression of distant genes (trans-eQTLs) and their biological mechanisms. In this work, we use genome-wide data on SNPs and array-based expression measures from mononuclear cells obtained from a population-based cohort of 1,799 Bangladeshi individuals to characterize cis- and trans-eQTLs and determine if observed trans-eQTL associations are mediated by expression of transcripts in cis with the SNPs showing trans-association, using Sobel tests of mediation. We observed 434 independent trans-eQTL associations at a false-discovery rate of 0.05, and 189 of these trans-eQTLs were also cis-eQTLs (enrichment P<0.0001). Among these 189 trans-eQTL associations, 39 were significantly attenuated after adjusting for a cis-mediator based on Sobel P<10-5. We attempted to replicate 21 of these mediation signals in two European cohorts, and while only 7 trans-eQTL associations were present in one or both cohorts, 6 showed evidence of cis-mediation. Analyses of simulated data show that complete mediation will be observed as partial mediation in the presence of mediator measurement error or imperfect LD between measured and causal variants. Our data demonstrates that trans-associations can become significantly stronger or switch directions after adjusting for a potential mediator. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is expected in the presence of strong cis-trans confounding and when the measured cis-transcript is correlated with the true (unmeasured) mediator. In conclusion, by applying mediation analysis to eQTL data, we show that a substantial fraction of observed trans-eQTL associations can be explained by cis-mediation. Future studies should focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying widespread cis-mediation and their relevance to disease biology, as well as using mediation analysis to improve eQTL discovery.",PLoS genetics,2014,Asia; Asian People; Bangladesh; Chemoprevention; Computer Simulation; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Quantitative Trait Loci; Selenium; Skin Neoplasms; Vitamin E,False,2
Estonian Biobank,25122052,Low-expression variant of fatty acid-binding protein 4 favors reduced manifestations of atherosclerotic disease and increased plaque stability.,"Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4 or aP2 in mice) has been identified as a key regulator of core aspects of cardiometabolic disorders, including lipotoxic endoplasmic reticulum stress in macrophages. A functional promoter polymorphism (rs77878271) of human FABP4 gene has been described resulting in reduced FABP4 transcription. We investigated the effects of this low-expression variant of FABP4 on cardiovascular morbidity and carotid atherosclerosis on a population level (n=7491) and in patient cohorts representing endarterectomized patients with advanced carotid atherosclerosis (n=92) and myocardial infarction (n=3432). We found that the low-expression variant was associated with decreased total cholesterol levels (P=0.006) with the largest reduction in variant allele homozygotes. Obese variant allele carriers also showed reduced carotid intima-media thickness (P=0.010) and lower prevalence of carotid plaques (P=0.060). Consistently, the variant allele homozygotes showed 8-fold lower odds for myocardial infarction (P=0.019; odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.003-0.801). Within the carotid plaques, the variant allele was associated with a 3.8-fold reduction in FABP4 transcription (P=0.049) and 2.7-fold reduction in apoptosis (activated caspase 3; P=0.043). Furthermore, the variant allele was enriched to patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (P=0.038). High FABP4 expression in the carotid plaques was associated with lipid accumulation, intraplaque hemorrhages, plaque ulcerations, and phosphoactivated endoplasmic reticulum stress markers. Our results reveal FABP4 rs77878271 as a novel variant affecting serum total cholesterol levels and cardiovascular risk.

Estonian Biobank,24969107,Genetic determinants of circulating interleukin-1 receptor antagonist levels and their association with glycemic traits.,"The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β is implicated in the development of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction, whereas higher circulating levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), an endogenous inhibitor of IL-1β, has been suggested to improve glycemia and β-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes. To elucidate the protective role of IL-1RA, this study aimed to identify genetic determinants of circulating IL-1RA concentration and to investigate their associations with immunological and metabolic variables related to cardiometabolic risk. In the analysis of seven discovery and four replication cohort studies, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were independently associated with circulating IL-1RA concentration (rs4251961 at the IL1RN locus [n = 13,955, P = 2.76 × 10(-21)] and rs6759676, closest gene locus IL1F10 [n = 13,994, P = 1.73 × 10(-17)]). The proportion of the variance in IL-1RA explained by both SNPs combined was 2.0%. IL-1RA-raising alleles of both SNPs were associated with lower circulating C-reactive protein concentration. The IL-1RA-raising allele of rs6759676 was also associated with lower fasting insulin levels and lower HOMA insulin resistance. In conclusion, we show that circulating IL-1RA levels are predicted by two independent SNPs at the IL1RN and IL1F10 loci and that genetically raised IL-1RA may be protective against the development of insulin resistance.",Diabetes,2014,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; C-Reactive Protein; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein; Interleukin-1; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Protective Factors; Young Adult",False,4

QT prolongation is a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) and could indicate the presence of the potentially lethal mendelian long-QT syndrome (LQTS). Using a genome-wide association and replication study in up to 100,000 individuals, we identified 35 common variant loci associated with QT interval that collectively explain ∼8-10% of QT-interval variation and highlight the importance of calcium regulation in myocardial repolarization. Rare variant analysis of 6 new QT interval-associated loci in 298 unrelated probands with LQTS identified coding variants not found in controls but of uncertain causality and therefore requiring validation.

The variant was confirmed in the proband with Sanger sequencing. Because the clinical phenotype associated with SCN8A mutations has previously been identified only in a few patients with or without epileptic seizures, these data together with our results suggest that mutations in SCN8A can lead to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with a broad phenotypic spectrum.

By testing different numbers of variants in independent studies, we show that the most strongly associated ∼2,000, ∼3,700 and ∼9,500 SNPs explained ∼21%, ∼24% and ∼29% of phenotypic variance. Furthermore, all common variants together captured 60% of heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci were enriched for genes, pathways and tissue types known to be involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways not highlighted in earlier efforts, such as signaling by fibroblast growth factors, WNT/β-catenin and chondroitin sulfate-related genes.

Estonian Biobank,24516404,Chromosome X-wide association study identifies Loci for fasting insulin and height and evidence for incomplete dosage compensation.,"The X chromosome (chrX) represents one potential source for the ""missing heritability"" for complex phenotypes, which thus far has remained underanalyzed in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we demonstrate the benefits of including chrX in GWAS by assessing the contribution of 404,862 chrX SNPs to levels of twelve commonly studied cardiometabolic and anthropometric traits in 19,697 Finnish and Swedish individuals with replication data on 5,032 additional Finns. By using a linear mixed model, we estimate that on average 2.6% of the additive genetic variance in these twelve traits is attributable to chrX, this being in proportion to the number of SNPs in the chromosome. In a chrX-wide association analysis, we identify three novel loci: two for height (rs182838724 near FGF16/ATRX/MAGT1, joint P-value = 2.71×10(-9), and rs1751138 near ITM2A, P-value = 3.03×10(-10)) and one for fasting insulin (rs139163435 in Xq23, P-value = 5.18×10(-9)). Further, we find that effect sizes for variants near ITM2A, a gene implicated in cartilage development, show evidence for a lack of dosage compensation. This observation is further supported by a sex-difference in ITM2A expression in whole blood (P-value = 0.00251), and is also in agreement with a previous report showing ITM2A escapes from X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in the majority of women. Hence, our results show one of the first links between phenotypic variation in a population sample and an XCI-escaping locus and pinpoint ITM2A as a potential contributor to the sexual dimorphism in height.

The method exploits increased phenotypic variance in the heterozygous genotype group relative to the homozygous groups. We applied the method to >56,000 unrelated individuals to search for POEs influencing body mass index (BMI). Six lead SNPs were carried forward for replication in five family-based studies (of ∼4,000 trios). Two SNPs replicated: the paternal rs2471083-C allele (located near the imprinted KCNK9 gene) and the paternal rs3091869-T allele (located near the SLC2A10 gene) increased BMI equally (beta = 0.11 (SD), P<0.0027) compared to the respective maternal alleles. Real-time PCR experiments of lymphoblastoid cell lines from the CEPH families showed that expression of both genes was dependent on parental origin of the SNPs alleles (P<0.01).

Six are located in or near genes potentially involved in pharmacokinetics (ABCG2, AHR, POR and CYP1A2) and pharmacodynamics (BDNF and SLC6A4) of caffeine. Two map to GCKR and MLXIPL genes related to metabolic traits but lacking known roles in coffee consumption. Enhancer and promoter histone marks populate the regions of many confirmed loci and several potential regulatory SNPs are highly correlated with the lead SNP of each. SNP alleles near GCKR, MLXIPL, BDNF and CYP1A2 that were associated with higher coffee consumption have previously been associated with smoking initiation, higher adiposity and fasting insulin and glucose but lower blood pressure and favorable lipid, inflammatory and liver enzyme profiles (P<5 × 10(-8)).Our genetic findings among European and African-American adults reinforce the role of caffeine in mediating habitual coffee consumption and may point to molecular mechanisms underlying inter-individual variability in pharmacological and health effects of coffee.",Molecular psychiatry,2015,"Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Coffea; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2; Feeding Behavior; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,7

Here, we present a study of 456 geographically diverse high-coverage Y chromosome sequences, including 299 newly reported samples. Applying ancient DNA calibration, we date the Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) in Africa at 254 (95% CI 192-307) kya and detect a cluster of major non-African founder haplogroups in a narrow time interval at 47-52 kya, consistent with a rapid initial colonization model of Eurasia and Oceania after the out-of-Africa bottleneck. In contrast to demographic reconstructions based on mtDNA, we infer a second strong bottleneck in Y-chromosome lineages dating to the last 10 ky.

Here we perform a whole-blood gene expression meta-analysis in 14,983 individuals of European ancestry (including replication) and identify 1,497 genes that are differentially expressed with chronological age. The age-associated genes do not harbor more age-associated CpG-methylation sites than other genes, but are instead enriched for the presence of potentially functional CpG-methylation sites in enhancer and insulator regions that associate with both chronological age and gene expression levels. We further used the gene expression profiles to calculate the 'transcriptomic age' of an individual, and show that differences between transcriptomic age and chronological age are associated with biological features linked to ageing, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting glucose, and body mass index.

Estonian Biobank,25339628,An epidemiological perspective of personalized medicine: the Estonian experience.,"The Estonian Biobank and several other biobanks established over a decade ago are now starting to yield valuable longitudinal follow-up data for large numbers of individuals. These samples have been used in hundreds of different genome-wide association studies, resulting in the identification of reliable disease-associated variants. The focus of genomic research has started to shift from identifying genetic and nongenetic risk factors associated with common complex diseases to understanding the underlying mechanisms of the diseases and suggesting novel targets for therapy. However, translation of findings from genomic research into medical practice is still lagging, mainly due to insufficient evidence of clinical validity and utility. In this review, we examine the different elements required for the implementation of personalized medicine based on genomic information. First, biobanks and genome centres are required and have been established for the high-throughput genomic screening of large numbers of samples. Secondly, the combination of susceptibility alleles into polygenic risk scores has improved risk prediction of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and several other diseases. Finally, national health information systems are being developed internationally, to combine data from electronic medical records from different sources, and also to gradually incorporate genomic information. We focus on the experience in Estonia, one of several countries with national goals towards more personalized health care based on genomic information, where the unique combination of elements required to accomplish this goal are already in place.",Journal of internal medicine,2015,Biological Specimen Banks; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiovascular Diseases; Electronic Health Records; Estonia; Female; Genetic Testing; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Humans; Molecular Epidemiology; Precision Medicine,False,0

Although many research studies have been performed on the vaginal microbiome, current knowledge of the male microbiome is scarce, and parallel studies examining couples are extremely rare. In this work, we aimed to compare seminal and vaginal microbiomes in couples and to assess the influence of sexual intercourse on vaginal microbiome. The study included 23 couples. Microbiomes of semen and vaginal fluid (pre- and post-intercourse) were profiled using Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing of the V6 region of 16S rRNA gene. Seminal communities were significantly more diverse, but with lower total bacterial concentrations than those of the vagina. Gardnerella vaginalis was predominant in half of the women whose partners had significant leukocytospermia, but only in one of 17 women who had a partner without leukocytospermia. There was significant decrease in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus crispatus after intercourse, and high concordance between semen and vaginal samples. Our data support the hypothesis that semen and vaginal microbiomes are in association, inasmuch as the predominance of G. vaginalis in female partners was significantly related to inflammation in male genital tracts.",Research in microbiology,2015,"Adult; Coitus; DNA, Bacterial; Female; Gardnerella vaginalis; Genital Diseases, Male; Genitalia, Male; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Inflammation; Lactobacillus; Leukocytes; Male; Microbial Consortia; Microbiota; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Semen; Sexual Partners; Spermatozoa; Vagina; Young Adult",False,4
Estonian Biobank,26306643,Harmonising and linking biomedical and clinical data across disparate data archives to enable integrative cross-biobank research.,"A wealth of biospecimen samples are stored in modern globally distributed biobanks. Biomedical researchers worldwide need to be able to combine the available resources to improve the power of large-scale studies. A prerequisite for this effort is to be able to search and access phenotypic, clinical and other information about samples that are currently stored at biobanks in an integrated manner. However, privacy issues together with heterogeneous information systems and the lack of agreed-upon vocabularies have made specimen searching across multiple biobanks extremely challenging. We describe three case studies where we have linked samples and sample descriptions in order to facilitate global searching of available samples for research. The use cases include the ENGAGE (European Network for Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology) consortium comprising at least 39 cohorts, the SUMMIT (surrogate markers for micro- and macro-vascular hard endpoints for innovative diabetes tools) consortium and a pilot for data integration between a Swedish clinical health registry and a biobank. We used the Sample avAILability (SAIL) method for data linking: first, created harmonised variables and then annotated and made searchable information on the number of specimens available in individual biobanks for various phenotypic categories. By operating on this categorised availability data we sidestep many obstacles related to privacy that arise when handling real values and show that harmonised and annotated records about data availability across disparate biomedical archives provide a key methodological advance in pre-analysis exchange of information between biobanks, that is, during the project planning phase.",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2016,"Biological Specimen Banks; Databases, Factual; Information Storage and Retrieval; Privacy",False,1

Genome-wide association studies have mapped multiple variants in CDH13 associated with cardiometabolic traits (CMT) with variable effects across studies. We hypothesized that this heterogeneity might reflect interplay with DNA methylation within the region. Resequencing and EpiTYPER™ assay were applied for the HYPertension in ESTonia/Coronary Artery Disease in Czech (HYPEST/CADCZ; n = 358) samples to identify CDH13 promoter SNPs acting as methylation Quantitative Trait Loci (meQTLs) and to investigate their associations with CMT. In silico data were extracted from genome-wide DNA methylation and genotype datasets of the population-based sample Estonian Genome Center of the University of Tartu (EGCUT; n = 165). HYPEST-CADCZ meta-analysis identified a rare variant rs113460564 as highly significant meQTL for a 134-bp distant CpG site (P = 5.90 × 10(-6); β = 3.19%). Four common SNPs (rs12443878, rs12444338, rs62040565, rs8060301) exhibited effect on methylation level of up to 3 neighboring CpG sites in both datasets. The strongest association was detected in EGCUT between rs8060301 and cg09415485 (false discovery rate corrected P value = 1.89 × 10(-30)). Simultaneously, rs8060301 showed association with diastolic blood pressure, serum high-density lipoprotein and HMW adiponectin (P < 0.005).

The contribution of these genetic variants to cognitive phenotypes in the general population remains unclear. To investigate the clinical features conferred by CNVs associated with known syndromes in adult carriers without clinical preselection and to assess the genome-wide consequences of rare CNVs (frequency ≤0.05%; size ≥250 kilobase pairs [kb]) on carriers' educational attainment and intellectual disability prevalence in the general population. The population biobank of Estonia contains 52,000 participants enrolled from 2002 through 2010. General practitioners examined participants and filled out a questionnaire of health- and lifestyle-related questions, as well as reported diagnoses. Copy number variant analysis was conducted on a random sample of 7877 individuals and genotype-phenotype associations with education and disease traits were evaluated. Our results were replicated on a high-functioning group of 993 Estonians and 3 geographically distinct populations in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy. Phenotypes of genomic disorders in the general population, prevalence of autosomal CNVs, and association of these variants with educational attainment (from less than primary school through scientific degree) and prevalence of intellectual disability. Of the 7877 in the Estonian cohort, we identified 56 carriers of CNVs associated with known syndromes. Their phenotypes, including cognitive and psychiatric problems, epilepsy, neuropathies, obesity, and congenital malformations are similar to those described for carriers of identical rearrangements ascertained in clinical cohorts. A genome-wide evaluation of rare autosomal CNVs (frequency, ≤0.05%; ≥250 kb) identified 831 carriers (10.5%) of the screened general population. Eleven of 216 (5.1%) carriers of a deletion of at least 250 kb (odds ratio [OR], 3.16; 95% CI, 1.51-5.98; P = 1.5e-03) and 6 of 102 (5.9%) carriers of a duplication of at least 1 Mb (OR, 3.67; 95% CI, 1.29-8.54; P = .008) had an intellectual disability compared with 114 of 6819 (1.7%) in the Estonian cohort. The mean education attainment was 3.81 (P = 1.06e-04) among 248 (≥250 kb) deletion carriers and 3.69 (P = 5.024e-05) among 115 duplication carriers (≥1 Mb). Of the deletion carriers, 33.5% did not graduate from high school (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.12-1.95; P = .005) and 39.1% of duplication carriers did not graduate high school (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.27-2.8; P = 1.6e-03). Evidence for an association between rare CNVs and lower educational attainment was supported by analyses of cohorts of adults from Italy and the United States and adolescents from the United Kingdom. Known pathogenic CNVs in unselected, but assumed to be healthy, adult populations may be associated with unrecognized clinical sequelae. Additionally, individually rare but collectively common intermediate-size CNVs may be negatively associated with educational attainment.

Estonian Biobank,26426971,The Influence of Age and Sex on Genetic Associations with Adult Body Size and Shape: A Large-Scale Genome-Wide Interaction Study.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 100 genetic variants contributing to BMI, a measure of body size, or waist-to-hip ratio (adjusted for BMI, WHRadjBMI), a measure of body shape. Body size and shape change as people grow older and these changes differ substantially between men and women. To systematically screen for age- and/or sex-specific effects of genetic variants on BMI and WHRadjBMI, we performed meta-analyses of 114 studies (up to 320,485 individuals of European descent) with genome-wide chip and/or Metabochip data by the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium. Each study tested the association of up to ~2.8M SNPs with BMI and WHRadjBMI in four strata (men ≤50y, men >50y, women ≤50y, women >50y) and summary statistics were combined in stratum-specific meta-analyses. We then screened for variants that showed age-specific effects (G x AGE), sex-specific effects (G x SEX) or age-specific effects that differed between men and women (G x AGE x SEX). For BMI, we identified 15 loci (11 previously established for main effects, four novel) that showed significant (FDR<5%) age-specific effects, of which 11 had larger effects in younger (<50y) than in older adults (≥50y). No sex-dependent effects were identified for BMI. For WHRadjBMI, we identified 44 loci (27 previously established for main effects, 17 novel) with sex-specific effects, of which 28 showed larger effects in women than in men, five showed larger effects in men than in women, and 11 showed opposite effects between sexes. No age-dependent effects were identified for WHRadjBMI. This is the first genome-wide interaction meta-analysis to report convincing evidence of age-dependent genetic effects on BMI. In addition, we confirm the sex-specificity of genetic effects on WHRadjBMI.

It genetically overlaps with major depressive disorder (MDD) and is therefore an important phenotype for psychiatric genetics. The Genetics of Personality Consortium has created a resource for genome-wide association analyses of personality traits in more than 63,000 participants (including MDD cases). To identify genetic variants associated with neuroticism by performing a meta-analysis of genome-wide association results based on 1000 Genomes imputation; to evaluate whether common genetic variants as assessed by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) explain variation in neuroticism by estimating SNP-based heritability; and to examine whether SNPs that predict neuroticism also predict MDD. Genome-wide association meta-analysis of 30 cohorts with genome-wide genotype, personality, and MDD data from the Genetics of Personality Consortium. The study included 63,661 participants from 29 discovery cohorts and 9786 participants from a replication cohort. Participants came from Europe, the United States, or Australia. Analyses were conducted between 2012 and 2014. Neuroticism scores harmonized across all 29 discovery cohorts by item response theory analysis, and clinical MDD case-control status in 2 of the cohorts. A genome-wide significant SNP was found on 3p14 in MAGI1 (rs35855737; P = 9.26 × 10-9 in the discovery meta-analysis). This association was not replicated (P = .32), but the SNP was still genome-wide significant in the meta-analysis of all 30 cohorts (P = 2.38 × 10-8). Common genetic variants explain 15% of the variance in neuroticism. Polygenic scores based on the meta-analysis of neuroticism in 27 cohorts significantly predicted neuroticism (1.09 × 10-12 < P < .05) and MDD (4.02 × 10-9 < P < .05) in the 2 other cohorts. This study identifies a novel locus for neuroticism. The variant is located in a known gene that has been associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in previous studies. In addition, the study shows that neuroticism is influenced by many genetic variants of small effect that are either common or tagged by common variants. These genetic variants also influence MDD.

Within the European Network for Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology (ENGAGE) Consortium, we have undertaken the first large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), supplemented by 1000G imputation, for four quantitative glycaemic and obesity-related traits, in up to 87,048 individuals of European ancestry. We identified two loci for body mass index (BMI) at genome-wide significance, and two for fasting glucose (FG), none of which has been previously reported in larger meta-analysis efforts to combine GWAS of European ancestry. Through conditional analysis, we also detected multiple distinct signals of association mapping to established loci for waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (RSPO3) and FG (GCK and G6PC2). The index variant for one association signal at the G6PC2 locus is a low-frequency coding allele, H177Y, which has recently been demonstrated to have a functional role in glucose regulation. Fine-mapping analyses revealed that the non-coding variants most likely to drive association signals at established and novel loci were enriched for overlap with enhancer elements, which for FG mapped to promoter and transcription factor binding sites in pancreatic islets, in particular. Our study demonstrates that 1000G imputation and genetic fine-mapping of common and low-frequency variant association signals at GWAS loci, integrated with genomic annotation in relevant tissues, can provide insight into the functional and regulatory mechanisms through which their effects on glycaemic and obesity-related traits are mediated.",PLoS genetics,2015,"Body Mass Index; Chromosome Mapping; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Germinal Center Kinases; Glucose-6-Phosphatase; Glycemic Index; Humans; Obesity; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Quantitative Trait Loci; Thrombospondins",False,6
Estonian Biobank,25997436,Mendelian randomization study of height and risk of colorectal cancer.,"For men and women, taller height is associated with increased risk of all cancers combined. For colorectal cancer (CRC), it is unclear whether the differential association of height by sex is real or is due to confounding or bias inherent in observational studies. We performed a Mendelian randomization study to examine the association between height and CRC risk. To minimize confounding and bias, we derived a weighted genetic risk score predicting height (using 696 genetic variants associated with height) in 10,226 CRC cases and 10,286 controls. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for associations between height, genetically predicted height and CRC. Using conventional methods, increased height (per 10-cm increment) was associated with increased CRC risk (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.02-1.15). In sex-specific analyses, height was associated with CRC risk for women (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.05-1.26), but not men (OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.92-1.05). Consistent with these results, carrying greater numbers of (weighted) height-increasing alleles (per 1-unit increase) was associated with higher CRC risk for women and men combined (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.01-1.14) and for women (OR = 1.09, 95% CI =  .01-1.19). There was weaker evidence of an association for men (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.96-1.15). We provide evidence for a causal association between height and CRC for women.

We used regression models and 140 lipid-associated genetic variants to estimate associations between circulating HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides and T2D and related traits. Each genetic test was corrected for effects of variants on the other two lipid types and surrogates of adiposity. We used the largest data sets available: 34,840 T2D case and 114,981 control subjects from the DIAGRAM (DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis) consortium and up to 133,010 individuals without diabetes for insulin secretion and sensitivity from the MAGIC (Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium) and GENESIS (GENEticS of Insulin Sensitivity) studies. Eight of 21 associations between groups of variants and diabetes traits were significant at the nominal level, including those between genetically determined lower HDL-C (β = -0.12, P = 0.03) and T2D and genetically determined lower LDL-C (β = -0.21, P = 5 × 10(-6)) and T2D. Although some of these may represent causal associations, we discuss why caution must be used when using Mendelian randomization in the context of circulating lipid levels and diabetes traits. In conclusion, we found evidence of links between genetic variants associated with lipids and T2D, but deeper knowledge of the underlying genetic mechanisms of specific lipid variants is needed before drawing definite conclusions about causality based on Mendelian randomization methodology.",Diabetes,2015,"Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Cluster Analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Lipids; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Triglycerides",False,7

The novel SNPs are located in or near genes encoding metabolite transporter proteins or enzymes (SLC22A16, ARG1, AGPS and ACSL1) that have demonstrated biomedical or pharmaceutical importance.

While trait-associated variants may operate in a cell-type specific manner, eQTL datasets for such cell-types may not always be available. We performed a genome-environment interaction (GxE) meta-analysis on data from 5,683 samples to infer the cell type specificity of whole blood cis-eQTLs. We demonstrate that this method is able to predict neutrophil and lymphocyte specific cis-eQTLs and replicate these predictions in independent cell-type specific datasets.

Estonian Biobank,25811787,Modulation of genetic associations with serum urate levels by body-mass-index in humans.,"We tested for interactions between body mass index (BMI) and common genetic variants affecting serum urate levels, genome-wide, in up to 42569 participants. Both stratified genome-wide association (GWAS) analyses, in lean, overweight and obese individuals, and regression-type analyses in a non BMI-stratified overall sample were performed. The former did not uncover any novel locus with a major main effect, but supported modulation of effects for some known and potentially new urate loci. The latter highlighted a SNP at RBFOX3 reaching genome-wide significant level (effect size 0.014, 95% CI 0.008-0.02, Pinter= 2.6 x 10-8). Two top loci in interaction term analyses, RBFOX3 and ERO1LB-EDARADD, also displayed suggestive differences in main effect size between the lean and obese strata. All top ranking loci for urate effect differences between BMI categories were novel and most had small magnitude but opposite direction effects between strata. They include the locus RBMS1-TANK (men, Pdifflean-overweight= 4.7 x 10-8), a region that has been associated with several obesity related traits, and TSPYL5 (men, Pdifflean-overweight= 9.1 x 10-8), regulating adipocytes-produced estradiol. The top-ranking known urate loci was ABCG2, the strongest known gout risk locus, with an effect halved in obese compared to lean men (Pdifflean-obese= 2 x 10-4). Finally, pathway analysis suggested a role for N-glycan biosynthesis as a prominent urate-associated pathway in the lean stratum.

Estonian Biobank,25853576,Haplotype phasing and inheritance of copy number variants in nuclear families.,"DNA copy number variants (CNVs) that alter the copy number of a particular DNA segment in the genome play an important role in human phenotypic variability and disease susceptibility. A number of CNVs overlapping with genes have been shown to confer risk to a variety of human diseases thus highlighting the relevance of addressing the variability of CNVs at a higher resolution. So far, it has not been possible to deterministically infer the allelic composition of different haplotypes present within the CNV regions. We have developed a novel computational method, called PiCNV, which enables to resolve the haplotype sequence composition within CNV regions in nuclear families based on SNP genotyping microarray data. The algorithm allows to i) phase normal and CNV-carrying haplotypes in the copy number variable regions, ii) resolve the allelic copies of rearranged DNA sequence within the haplotypes and iii) infer the heritability of identified haplotypes in trios or larger nuclear families. To our knowledge this is the first program available that can deterministically phase null, mono-, di-, tri- and tetraploid genotypes in CNV loci. We applied our method to study the composition and inheritance of haplotypes in CNV regions of 30 HapMap Yoruban trios and 34 Estonian families. For 93.6% of the CNV loci, PiCNV enabled to unambiguously phase normal and CNV-carrying haplotypes and follow their transmission in the corresponding families. Furthermore, allelic composition analysis identified the co-occurrence of alternative allelic copies within 66.7% of haplotypes carrying copy number gains. We also observed less frequent transmission of CNV-carrying haplotypes from parents to children compared to normal haplotypes and identified an emergence of several de novo deletions and duplications in the offspring.",PloS one,2015,"Algorithms; Alleles; DNA Copy Number Variations; Databases, Genetic; Genome, Human; Genotype; HapMap Project; Haplotypes; Humans; Nuclear Family; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Pedigree; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,9
Estonian Biobank,26376864,Gene-based meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies implicates new loci involved in obesity.,"To date, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified >100 loci with single variants associated with body mass index (BMI). This approach may miss loci with high allelic heterogeneity; therefore, the aim of the present study was to use gene-based meta-analysis to identify regions with high allelic heterogeneity to discover additional obesity susceptibility loci. We included GWAS data from 123 865 individuals of European descent from 46 cohorts in Stage 1 and Metabochip data from additional 103 046 individuals from 43 cohorts in Stage 2, all within the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium. Each cohort was tested for association between ∼2.4 million (Stage 1) or ∼200 000 (Stage 2) imputed or genotyped single variants and BMI, and summary statistics were subsequently meta-analyzed in 17 941 genes. We used the 'VErsatile Gene-based Association Study' (VEGAS) approach to assign variants to genes and to calculate gene-based P-values based on simulations. The VEGAS method was applied to each cohort separately before a gene-based meta-analysis was performed. In Stage 1, two known (FTO and TMEM18) and six novel (PEX2, MTFR2, SSFA2, IARS2, CEP295 and TXNDC12) loci were associated with BMI (P < 2.8 × 10(-6) for 17 941 gene tests). We confirmed all loci, and six of them were gene-wide significant in Stage 2 alone. We provide biological support for the loci by pathway, expression and methylation analyses. Our results indicate that gene-based meta-analysis of GWAS provides a useful strategy to find loci of interest that were not identified in standard single-marker analyses due to high allelic heterogeneity.",Human molecular genetics,2015,"Body Mass Index; Female; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Obesity; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; White People",False,6
Estonian Biobank,25712230,The prevalence and phenotypic characteristics of spontaneous premature ovarian failure: a general population registry-based study.,"What is the measured prevalence and phenotype of spontaneous premature ovarian failure (POF) in the general population? Spontaneous POF occurs in ∼1% of the general population with unique phenotype of post-menopausal ageing distinct from surgically induced premature menopause. POF is multifactorial ovarian quiescence before the age of 40. The clinical features of POF are diverse and the population prevalence of POF is still not known. This population-depictive registry-based case-cohort study included 34 041 women from the Estonian Genome Center registered between 2003 and 2013. Spontaneous POF was selected retrospectively by excluding other causes for premature menopause under the age of 40 (N = 310) and women with surgically induced premature menopause participated as a reference group (N = 242). The prevalence of spontaneous POF was 0.91% (0.81-1.02%) among women of the general population in Estonia. In women with POF, menarche occurred a few months later than in the reference group and a significantly higher number of live births during their reproductive life was recorded. Women with POF also consumed less alcohol and had smaller waist-to-hip ratios than those in the reference group, although both groups of women were similar in body mass index a decade after menopause. The prevalence of concomitant diseases was similar between two groups of women by their fifties, but the pattern of onset of these diseases was different. Surgically induced premature menopause associated with faster development of osteoporosis, hypertension, and connective tissue diseases, but slower development of allergies, compared with spontaneous POF. The age of menopause was determined by irregular menstrual cycles, but not by the length of regular menstrual cycles, the age of menarche, the number of pregnancies or live births, smoking or alcohol consumption, or the use of oral contraceptives for some time during the reproductive period. POF is rarely stated in medical records and cannot be diagnosed retrospectively by standard procedures. Therefore the data on all cases of women with primary amenorrhea or premature menopause before the age of 40 were requested from the registry and spontaneous POF was predicted retrospectively by excluding other extraovarian causes for premature menopause. Since the current study is retrospective registry-based data analysis, no genetic evaluation concerning possible candidate genes and no blood analysis concerning immunologic disorders could be performed to describe etiopathogenesis of POF. Spontaneous POF most likely comprises several diseases with different etiopathologies and there may be a unique phenotype of post-menopausal ageing distinct from that in surgically induced premature menopause. Irregular menstrual cycles may be a prospective risk for developing spontaneous POF. Compared with spontaneous POF, surgically induced premature menopause associates with faster development of age-related diseases. The data point to new ideas and hypotheses for further studies on etiopathologies and treatment options for spontaneous POF.

Here, we extend our previous meta-analysis of European ancestry by refined genotype calling and imputation and by the addition of 5,033 cases and 5,707 controls. The combined analysis, consisting of over 15,000 cases and 27,000 controls, identifies five new psoriasis susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10(-8)). The newly identified signals include two that reside in intergenic regions (1q31.1 and 5p13.1) and three residing near PLCL2 (3p24.3), NFKBIZ (3q12.3) and CAMK2G (10q22.2).

Estonian Biobank,26620891,16p11.2 Locus modulates response to satiety before the onset of obesity.,"The 600 kb BP4-BP5 copy number variants (CNVs) at the 16p11.2 locus have been associated with a range of neurodevelopmental conditions including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. The number of genomic copies in this region is inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI): the deletion is associated with a highly penetrant form of obesity (present in 50% of carriers by the age of 7 years and in 70% of adults), and the duplication with being underweight. Mechanisms underlying this energy imbalance remain unknown. This study aims to investigate eating behavior, cognitive traits and their relationships with BMI in carriers of 16p11.2 CNVs. We assessed individuals carrying a 16p11.2 deletion or duplication and their intrafamilial controls using food-related behavior questionnaires and cognitive measures. We also compared these carriers with cohorts of individuals presenting with obesity, binge eating disorder or bulimia. Response to satiety is gene dosage-dependent in pediatric CNV carriers. Altered satiety response is present in young deletion carriers before the onset of obesity. It remains altered in adolescent carriers and correlates with obesity. Adult deletion carriers exhibit eating behavior similar to that seen in a cohort of obesity without eating disorders such as bulimia or binge eating. None of the cognitive measures are associated with eating behavior or BMI. These findings suggest that abnormal satiety response is a strong contributor to the energy imbalance in 16p11.2 CNV carriers, and, akin to other genetic forms of obesity, altered satiety responsiveness in children precedes the increase in BMI observed later in adolescence.",International journal of obesity (2005),2016,"Adult; Autistic Disorder; Body Mass Index; Case-Control Studies; Child; Chromosome Deletion; Chromosome Disorders; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16; Cognitive Dysfunction; DNA Copy Number Variations; Energy Metabolism; Executive Function; Feeding Behavior; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Male; Obesity; Phenotype; Satiation; Sequence Deletion; Switzerland",False,6
Estonian Biobank,26050255,Sex hormone-binding globulin associations with circulating lipids and metabolites and the risk for type 2 diabetes: observational and causal effect estimates.,"The causal role of circulating sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) for type 2 diabetes is controversial. Information on the relations between SHBG and new biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk is scarce. We applied quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics in three Finnish population-based cohorts to comprehensively profile circulating lipids and metabolites and study their associations with SHBG. Mendelian randomization was used to examine potential causality of SHBG on the metabolic measures and insulin resistance. Prospective associations and causal effect estimates of SHBG on type 2 diabetes were assessed via meta-analysis including summary statistics from the DIAGRAM consortium. In cross-sectional analysis in 6475 young adults (mean age 31, 57% men), higher SHBG was linked with a more favourable cardiometabolic risk profile, including associations with lipoprotein subclasses, fatty acid composition, amino acids, ketone bodies and inflammation-linked glycoproteins. Prospective analysis of 1377 young adults with 6-year follow-up indicated that SHBG is also associated with future insulin resistance. Mendelian randomization suggested only minor, if any, causal effects of SHBG on lipid and metabolite measures and insulin resistance(n = 10,895).Causal effect estimates on type 2 diabetes for 41,439 cases and 103,870 controls indicated a causative protective role of SHBG (OR = 0.83 per 1-SD, 95% CI: 0.76, 0.91); however, effects were considerably weaker than observed in meta-analysis of prospective studies [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.47 per 1-SD, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.53]. Circulating SHBG is strongly associated with systemic metabolism and predictive for insulin resistance and diabetes.

To identify the epigenetic changes involved in GD, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks in sorted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We found 365 and 3322 differentially methylated CpG sites in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. Among the hypermethylated CpG sites, we specifically found enrichment of genes involved in T cell signaling (CD247, LCK, ZAP70, CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CTLA4 and CD8A) and decreased expression of CD3 gene family members. The hypermethylation was accompanied with decreased levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac marks at several T cell signaling genes in ChIP-seq analysis. In addition, we found hypermethylation of the TSHR gene first intron, where several GD-associated polymorphisms are located.

Estonian Biobank,25712996,Age- and sex-specific causal effects of adiposity on cardiovascular risk factors.,"Observational studies have reported different effects of adiposity on cardiovascular risk factors across age and sex. Since cardiovascular risk factors are enriched in obese individuals, it has not been easy to dissect the effects of adiposity from those of other risk factors. We used a Mendelian randomization approach, applying a set of 32 genetic markers to estimate the causal effect of adiposity on blood pressure, glycemic indices, circulating lipid levels, and markers of inflammation and liver disease in up to 67,553 individuals. All analyses were stratified by age (cutoff 55 years of age) and sex. The genetic score was associated with BMI in both nonstratified analysis (P = 2.8 × 10(-107)) and stratified analyses (all P < 3.3 × 10(-30)). We found evidence of a causal effect of adiposity on blood pressure, fasting levels of insulin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in a nonstratified analysis and in the <55-year stratum. Further, we found evidence of a smaller causal effect on total cholesterol (P for difference = 0.015) in the ≥55-year stratum than in the <55-year stratum, a finding that could be explained by biology, survival bias, or differential medication.

By integrating public expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data, miRNA binding site predictions, small RNA sequencing, and Argonaute crosslinking immunoprecipitation (AGO-CLIP) datasets, we identified genetic variants that can affect gene expression by modulating miRNA binding efficiency.

Estonian Biobank,26423639,Appetitive traits as behavioural pathways in genetic susceptibility to obesity: a population-based cross-sectional study.,"The mechanisms through which genes influence body weight are not well understood, but appetite has been implicated as one mediating pathway. Here we use data from two independent population-based Finnish cohorts (4632 adults aged 25-74 years from the DILGOM study and 1231 twin individuals aged 21-26 years from the FinnTwin12 study) to investigate whether two appetitive traits mediate the associations between known obesity-related genetic variants and adiposity. The results from structural equation modelling indicate that the effects of a polygenic risk score (90 obesity-related loci) on measured body mass index and waist circumference are partly mediated through higher levels of uncontrolled eating (βindirect = 0.030-0.032, P < 0.001 in DILGOM) and emotional eating (βindirect = 0.020-0.022, P < 0.001 in DILGOM and βindirect = 0.013-0.015, P = 0.043-0.044 in FinnTwin12).

Although all immune cells are affected during aging, the functional capacity of T cells is most influenced and is linked to decreased responsiveness to infections and impaired differentiation. We studied age-related changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from younger and older individuals. We observed marked difference between T cell subsets, with increased number of methylation changes and higher methylome variation in CD8+ T cells with age. The majority of age-related hypermethylated sites were located at CpG islands of silent genes and enriched for repressive histone marks. Specifically, in CD8+ T cell subset we identified strong inverse correlation between methylation and expression levels in genes associated with T cell mediated immune response (LGALS1, IFNG, CCL5, GZMH, CCR7, CD27 and CD248) and differentiation (SATB1, TCF7, BCL11B and RUNX3).

Estonian Biobank,26626624,Genome-wide Association Analysis of Psoriatic Arthritis and Cutaneous Psoriasis Reveals Differences in Their Genetic Architecture.,"Psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) is a common inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin disease. Up to 30% of people with PsV eventually develop psoriatic arthritis (PsA), an inflammatory musculoskeletal condition. To discern differences in genetic risk factors for PsA and cutaneous-only psoriasis (PsC), we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1,430 PsA case subjects and 1,417 unaffected control subjects. Meta-analysis of this study with three other GWASs and two targeted genotyping studies, encompassing a total of 9,293 PsV case subjects, 3,061 PsA case subjects, 3,110 PsC case subjects, and 13,670 unaffected control subjects of European descent, detected 10 regions associated with PsA and 11 with PsC at genome-wide (GW) significance. Several of these association signals (IFNLR1, IFIH1, NFKBIA for PsA; TNFRSF9, LCE3C/B, TRAF3IP2, IL23A, NFKBIA for PsC) have not previously achieved GW significance. After replication, we also identified a PsV-associated SNP near CDKAL1 (rs4712528, odds ratio [OR] = 1.16, p = 8.4 × 10(-11)). Among identified psoriasis risk variants, three were more strongly associated with PsC than PsA (rs12189871 near HLA-C, p = 5.0 × 10(-19); rs4908742 near TNFRSF9, p = 0.00020; rs10888503 near LCE3A, p = 0.0014), and two were more strongly associated with PsA than PsC (rs12044149 near IL23R, p = 0.00018; rs9321623 near TNFAIP3, p = 0.00022). The PsA-specific variants were independent of previously identified psoriasis variants near IL23R and TNFAIP3.

Despite its substantial heritability, no genetic variants have been detected in previous genome-wide association (GWA) studies, which may be due to relatively small sample sizes of those studies. Here, we report on a large meta-analysis of GWA studies for extraversion in 63,030 subjects in 29 cohorts. Extraversion item data from multiple personality inventories were harmonized across inventories and cohorts. No genome-wide significant associations were found at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level but there was one significant hit at the gene level for a long non-coding RNA site (LOC101928162). Genome-wide complex trait analysis in two large cohorts showed that the additive variance explained by common SNPs was not significantly different from zero, but polygenic risk scores, weighted using linkage information, significantly predicted extraversion scores in an independent cohort. These results show that extraversion is a highly polygenic personality trait, with an architecture possibly different from other complex human traits, including other personality traits.

Estonian Biobank,26376747,Somatic mosaicism for copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity and DNA copy number variations in the human genome.,"Somatic mosaicism denotes the presence of genetically distinct populations of somatic cells in one individual who has developed from a single fertilised oocyte. Mosaicism may result from a mutation that occurs during postzygotic development and is propagated to only a subset of the adult cells. Our aim was to investigate both somatic mosaicism for copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cn-LOH) events and DNA copy number variations (CNVs) in fully differentiated tissues. We studied panels of tissue samples (11-12 tissues per individual) from four autopsy subjects using high-resolution Illumina HumanOmniExpress-12 BeadChips to reveal the presence of possible intra-individual tissue-specific cn-LOH and CNV patterns. We detected five mosaic cn-LOH regions >5 Mb in some tissue samples in three out of four individuals. We also detected three CNVs that affected only a portion of the tissues studied in one out of four individuals. These three somatic CNVs range from 123 to 796 kb and are also found in the general population. An attempt was made to explain the succession of genomic events that led to the observed somatic genetic mosaicism under the assumption that the specific mosaic patterns of CNV and cn-LOH changes reflect their formation during the postzygotic embryonic development of germinal layers and organ systems. Our results give further support to the idea that somatic mosaicism for CNVs, and also cn-LOHs, is a common phenomenon in phenotypically normal humans. Thus, the examination of only a single tissue might not provide enough information to diagnose potentially deleterious CNVs within an individual. During routine CNV and cn-LOH analysis, DNA derived from a buccal swab can be used in addition to blood DNA to get information about the CNV/cn-LOH content in tissues of both mesodermal and ectodermal origin. Currently, the real frequency and possible phenotypic consequences of both CNVs and cn-LOHs that display somatic mosaicism remain largely unknown. To answer these questions, future studies should involve larger cohorts of individuals and a range of tissues.",BMC genomics,2015,"Adult; Autopsy; DNA Copy Number Variations; Female; Genome, Human; Humans; Loss of Heterozygosity; Male; Middle Aged; Mosaicism; Organ Specificity; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,0

Copy number of AMY1 is reported to be the largest genomic influence on obesity, although genome-wide association studies for obesity have found this locus unremarkable. Using whole-genome sequence analysis, droplet digital PCR and genome mapping, we identified eight common structural haplotypes of the amylase locus that suggest its mutational history. We found that the AMY1 copy number in an individual's genome is generally even (rather than odd) and partially correlates with nearby SNPs, which do not associate with body mass index (BMI).

Here we interrogated the transcriptome of individuals carrying reciprocal 16p11.2 CNVs. Transcript perturbations correlated with clinical endophenotypes and were enriched for genes associated with ASDs, abnormalities of head size, and ciliopathies. Ciliary gene expression was also perturbed in orthologous mouse models, raising the possibility that ciliary dysfunction contributes to 16p11.2 pathologies. In support of this hypothesis, we found structural ciliary defects in the CA1 hippocampal region of 16p11.2 duplication mice. Moreover, by using an established zebrafish model, we show genetic interaction between KCTD13, a key driver of the mirrored neuroanatomical phenotypes of the 16p11.2 CNV, and ciliopathy-associated genes. Overexpression of BBS7 rescues head size and neuroanatomical defects of kctd13 morphants, whereas suppression or overexpression of CEP290 rescues phenotypes induced by KCTD13 under- or overexpression, respectively. Our data suggest that dysregulation of ciliopathy genes contributes to the clinical phenotypes of these CNVs.",American journal of human genetics,2015,"Animals; Brain; Child; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Chromosome Deletion; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16; Ciliary Body; DNA Copy Number Variations; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Mice; Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated; Schizophrenia; Transcriptome; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins",False,7
Estonian Biobank,25407005,BBMRI-ERIC as a resource for pharmaceutical and life science industries: the development of biobank-based Expert Centres.,"Biological resources (cells, tissues, bodily fluids or biomolecules) are considered essential raw material for the advancement of health-related biotechnology, for research and development in life sciences, and for ultimately improving human health. Stored in local biobanks, access to the human biological samples and related medical data for transnational research is often limited, in particular for the international life science industry. The recently established pan-European Biobanking and BioMolecular resources Research Infrastructure-European Research Infrastructure Consortium (BBMRI-ERIC) aims to improve accessibility and interoperability between academic and industrial parties to benefit personalized medicine, disease prevention to promote development of new diagnostics, devices and medicines. BBMRI-ERIC is developing the concept of Expert Centre as public-private partnerships in the precompetitive, not-for-profit field to provide a new structure to perform research projects that would face difficulties under currently established models of academic-industry collaboration.

Estonian Biobank,25898006,The genetic legacy of the expansion of Turkic-speaking nomads across Eurasia.,"The Turkic peoples represent a diverse collection of ethnic groups defined by the Turkic languages. These groups have dispersed across a vast area, including Siberia, Northwest China, Central Asia, East Europe, the Caucasus, Anatolia, the Middle East, and Afghanistan. The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia. Previous genetic studies have not identified a clear-cut unifying genetic signal for the Turkic peoples, which lends support for language replacement rather than demic diffusion as the model for the Turkic language's expansion. We addressed the genetic origin of 373 individuals from 22 Turkic-speaking populations, representing their current geographic range, by analyzing genome-wide high-density genotype data. In agreement with the elite dominance model of language expansion most of the Turkic peoples studied genetically resemble their geographic neighbors. However, western Turkic peoples sampled across West Eurasia shared an excess of long chromosomal tracts that are identical by descent (IBD) with populations from present-day South Siberia and Mongolia (SSM), an area where historians center a series of early Turkic and non-Turkic steppe polities. While SSM matching IBD tracts (> 1cM) are also observed in non-Turkic populations, Turkic peoples demonstrate a higher percentage of such tracts (p-values ≤ 0.01) compared to their non-Turkic neighbors. Finally, we used the ALDER method and inferred admixture dates (~9th-17th centuries) that overlap with the Turkic migrations of the 5th-16th centuries. Thus, our results indicate historical admixture among Turkic peoples, and the recent shared ancestry with modern populations in SSM supports one of the hypothesized homelands for their nomadic Turkic and related Mongolic ancestors.",PLoS genetics,2015,"Asia; Asian People; China; Chromosomes; Chromosomes, Human, Y; Ethnicity; Europe; Gene Flow; Genetics, Population; Genotype; History, 15th Century; History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; History, Medieval; Human Migration; Humans; Language; Middle East; Mongolia; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Siberia",False,9

Here we find that many independent loci contribute to population genetic differences in height and body mass index (BMI) in 9,416 individuals across 14 European countries. Using discovery data on over 250,000 individuals and unbiased effect size estimates from 17,500 sibling pairs, we estimate that 24% (95% credible interval (CI) = 9%, 41%) and 8% (95% CI = 4%, 16%) of the captured additive genetic variance for height and BMI, respectively, reflect population genetic differences. Population genetic divergence differed significantly from that in a null model (height, P < 3.94 × 10(-8); BMI, P < 5.95 × 10(-4)), and we find an among-population genetic correlation for tall and slender individuals (r = -0.80, 95% CI = -0.95, -0.60), consistent with correlated selection for both phenotypes. Observed differences in height among populations reflected the predicted genetic means (r = 0.51; P < 0.001), but environmental differences across Europe masked genetic differentiation for BMI (P < 0.58).",Nature genetics,2015,"Algorithms; Body Height; Body Mass Index; Europe; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Geography; Humans; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Principal Component Analysis",False,9
Estonian Biobank,26131930,Directional dominance on stature and cognition in diverse human populations.,"Homozygosity has long been associated with rare, often devastating, Mendelian disorders, and Darwin was one of the first to recognize that inbreeding reduces evolutionary fitness. However, the effect of the more distant parental relatedness that is common in modern human populations is less well understood. Genomic data now allow us to investigate the effects of homozygosity on traits of public health importance by observing contiguous homozygous segments (runs of homozygosity), which are inferred to be homozygous along their complete length. Given the low levels of genome-wide homozygosity prevalent in most human populations, information is required on very large numbers of people to provide sufficient power. Here we use runs of homozygosity to study 16 health-related quantitative traits in 354,224 individuals from 102 cohorts, and find statistically significant associations between summed runs of homozygosity and four complex traits: height, forced expiratory lung volume in one second, general cognitive ability and educational attainment (P < 1 × 10(-300), 2.1 × 10(-6), 2.5 × 10(-10) and 1.8 × 10(-10), respectively). In each case, increased homozygosity was associated with decreased trait value, equivalent to the offspring of first cousins being 1.2 cm shorter and having 10 months' less education. Similar effect sizes were found across four continental groups and populations with different degrees of genome-wide homozygosity, providing evidence that homozygosity, rather than confounding, directly contributes to phenotypic variance. Contrary to earlier reports in substantially smaller samples, no evidence was seen of an influence of genome-wide homozygosity on blood pressure and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or ten other cardio-metabolic traits. Since directional dominance is predicted for traits under directional evolutionary selection, this study provides evidence that increased stature and cognitive function have been positively selected in human evolution, whereas many important risk factors for late-onset complex diseases may not have been.",Nature,2015,"Biological Evolution; Blood Pressure; Body Height; Cholesterol, LDL; Cognition; Cohort Studies; Educational Status; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Genome, Human; Homozygote; Humans; Lung Volume Measurements; Male; Phenotype",False,9

His most affected muscles were neck extensors showing a dropped head sign, proximal muscles of lower limbs with positive Gower's sign, and trunk muscles. Brain and spinal cord MRI scans, echocardiography, and laboratory analyses including creatine kinase and lactate did not reveal any abnormalities. Muscle histopathology showed fiber-type disproportion. Whole exome sequencing of the parents-offspring trio revealed a novel de novo c.5655G>A p.(Ala1885=) synonymous substitution of the last nucleotide in exon 38 of the MYH7 gene. Further RNA investigations proved the skipping of exon 38 (p.1854_1885del). This is a first report of an exon-skipping mutation in the MYH7 gene causing myopathy.

Estonian Biobank,25865494,Genome-wide Analysis of Body Proportion Classifies Height-Associated Variants by Mechanism of Action and Implicates Genes Important for Skeletal Development.,"Human height is a composite measurement, reflecting the sum of leg, spine, and head lengths. Many common variants influence total height, but the effects of these or other variants on the components of height (body proportion) remain largely unknown. We studied sitting height ratio (SHR), the ratio of sitting height to total height, to identify such effects in 3,545 African Americans and 21,590 individuals of European ancestry. We found that SHR is heritable: 26% and 39% of the total variance of SHR can be explained by common variants in European and African Americans, respectively, and global European admixture is negatively correlated with SHR in African Americans (r(2) ≈ 0.03). Six regions reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10(-8)) for association with SHR and overlapped biological candidate genes, including TBX2 and IGFBP3. We found that 130 of 670 height-associated variants are nominally associated (p < 0.05) with SHR, more than expected by chance (p = 5 × 10(-40)). At these 130 loci, the height-increasing alleles are associated with either a decrease (71 loci) or increase (59 loci) in SHR, suggesting that different height loci disproportionally affect either leg length or spine/head length. Pathway analyses via DEPICT revealed that height loci affecting SHR, and especially those affecting leg length, show enrichment of different biological pathways (e.g., bone/cartilage/growth plate pathways) than do loci with no effect on SHR (e.g., embryonic development). These results highlight the value of using a pair of related but orthogonal phenotypes, in this case SHR with height, as a prism to dissect the biology underlying genetic associations in polygenic traits and diseases.",American journal of human genetics,2015,"Adult; Black or African American; Body Height; Chromosome Mapping; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Leg Bones; Male; Middle Aged; Multifactorial Inheritance; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; White People",False,0
Estonian Biobank,26118792,Microbial population dynamics in response to Pectobacterium atrosepticum infection in potato tubers.,"Endophytes are microbes and fungi that live inside plant tissues without damaging the host. Herein we examine the dynamic changes in the endophytic bacterial community in potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber in response to pathogenic infection by Pectobacterium atrosepticum, which causes soft rot in numerous economically important crops. We quantified community changes using both cultivation and next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and found that, despite observing significant variability in both the mass of macerated tissue and structure of the endophytic community between individual potato tubers, P. atrosepticum is always taken over by the endophytes during maceration. 16S rDNA sequencing revealed bacteria from the phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, TM7, and Deinococcus-Thermus. Prior to infection, Propionibacterium acnes is frequently among the dominant taxa, yet is out competed by relatively few dominant taxa as the infection proceeds. Two days post-infection, the most abundant sequences in macerated potato tissue are Gammaproteobacteria. The most dominant genera are Enterobacter and Pseudomonas. Eight days post-infection, the number of anaerobic pectolytic Clostridia increases, probably due to oxygen depletion. These results demonstrate that the pathogenesis is strictly initiated by the pathogen (sensu stricto) and proceeds with a major contribution from the endophytic community.",Scientific reports,2015,"Base Sequence; Endophytes; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Microbiota; Pectobacterium; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Plant Tubers; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Solanum tuberosum",False,7
Estonian Biobank,25785607,A meta-analysis of gene expression signatures of blood pressure and hypertension.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered numerous genetic variants (SNPs) that are associated with blood pressure (BP). Genetic variants may lead to BP changes by acting on intermediate molecular phenotypes such as coded protein sequence or gene expression, which in turn affect BP variability. Therefore, characterizing genes whose expression is associated with BP may reveal cellular processes involved in BP regulation and uncover how transcripts mediate genetic and environmental effects on BP variability. A meta-analysis of results from six studies of global gene expression profiles of BP and hypertension in whole blood was performed in 7017 individuals who were not receiving antihypertensive drug treatment. We identified 34 genes that were differentially expressed in relation to BP (Bonferroni-corrected p<0.05). Among these genes, FOS and PTGS2 have been previously reported to be involved in BP-related processes; the others are novel. The top BP signature genes in aggregate explain 5%-9% of inter-individual variance in BP. Of note, rs3184504 in SH2B3, which was also reported in GWAS to be associated with BP, was found to be a trans regulator of the expression of 6 of the transcripts we found to be associated with BP (FOS, MYADM, PP1R15A, TAGAP, S100A10, and FGBP2). Gene set enrichment analysis suggested that the BP-related global gene expression changes include genes involved in inflammatory response and apoptosis pathways.

Estonian Biobank,26423011,"Novel insights into the genetics of smoking behaviour, lung function, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (UK BiLEVE): a genetic association study in UK Biobank.","Understanding the genetic basis of airflow obstruction and smoking behaviour is key to determining the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We used UK Biobank data to study the genetic causes of smoking behaviour and lung health. We sampled individuals of European ancestry from UK Biobank, from the middle and extremes of the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) distribution among heavy smokers (mean 35 pack-years) and never smokers. We developed a custom array for UK Biobank to provide optimum genome-wide coverage of common and low-frequency variants, dense coverage of genomic regions already implicated in lung health and disease, and to assay rare coding variants relevant to the UK population. We investigated whether there were shared genetic causes between different phenotypes defined by extremes of FEV1. We also looked for novel variants associated with extremes of FEV1 and smoking behaviour and assessed regions of the genome that had already shown evidence for a role in lung health and disease. We set genome-wide significance at p<5 × 10(-8). UK Biobank participants were recruited from March 15, 2006, to July 7, 2010. Sample selection for the UK BiLEVE study started on Nov 22, 2012, and was completed on Dec 20, 2012. We selected 50,008 unique samples: 10,002 individuals with low FEV1, 10,000 with average FEV1, and 5002 with high FEV1 from each of the heavy smoker and never smoker groups. We noted a substantial sharing of genetic causes of low FEV1 between heavy smokers and never smokers (p=2.29 × 10(-16)) and between individuals with and without doctor-diagnosed asthma (p=6.06 × 10(-11)). We discovered six novel genome-wide significant signals of association with extremes of FEV1, including signals at four novel loci (KANSL1, TSEN54, TET2, and RBM19/TBX5) and independent signals at two previously reported loci (NPNT and HLA-DQB1/HLA-DQA2). These variants also showed association with COPD, including in individuals with no history of smoking. The number of copies of a 150 kb region containing the 5' end of KANSL1, a gene that is important for epigenetic gene regulation, was associated with extremes of FEV1. We also discovered five new genome-wide significant signals for smoking behaviour, including a variant in NCAM1 (chromosome 11) and a variant on chromosome 2 (between TEX41 and PABPC1P2) that has a trans effect on expression of NCAM1 in brain tissue. By sampling from the extremes of the lung function distribution in UK Biobank, we identified novel genetic causes of lung function and smoking behaviour. These results provide new insight into the specific mechanisms underlying airflow obstruction, COPD, and tobacco addiction, and show substantial shared genetic architecture underlying airflow obstruction across individuals, irrespective of smoking behaviour and other airway disease.

Genetic variants showing robust associations with obesity traits have been identified through genome-wide association studies. We investigated whether a composite score representing healthy diet modifies associations of these variants with obesity traits. Totally, 32 body mass index (BMI)- and 14 waist-hip ratio (WHR)-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped, and genetic risk scores (GRS) were calculated in 18 cohorts of European ancestry (n = 68 317). Diet score was calculated based on self-reported intakes of whole grains, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts/seeds (favorable) and red/processed meats, sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages and fried potatoes (unfavorable). Multivariable adjusted, linear regression within each cohort followed by inverse variance-weighted, fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to characterize: (a) associations of each GRS with BMI and BMI-adjusted WHR and (b) diet score modification of genetic associations with BMI and BMI-adjusted WHR. Nominally significant interactions (P = 0.006-0.04) were observed between the diet score and WHR-GRS (but not BMI-GRS), two WHR loci (GRB14 rs10195252; LYPLAL1 rs4846567) and two BMI loci (LRRN6C rs10968576; MTIF3 rs4771122), for the respective BMI-adjusted WHR or BMI outcomes.

Estonian Biobank,26323059,Genetic variance estimation with imputed variants finds negligible missing heritability for human height and body mass index.,"We propose a method (GREML-LDMS) to estimate heritability for human complex traits in unrelated individuals using whole-genome sequencing data. We demonstrate using simulations based on whole-genome sequencing data that ∼97% and ∼68% of variation at common and rare variants, respectively, can be captured by imputation. Using the GREML-LDMS method, we estimate from 44,126 unrelated individuals that all ∼17 million imputed variants explain 56% (standard error (s.e.) = 2.3%) of variance for height and 27% (s.e. = 2.5%) of variance for body mass index (BMI), and we find evidence that height- and BMI-associated variants have been under natural selection. Considering the imperfect tagging of imputation and potential overestimation of heritability from previous family-based studies, heritability is likely to be 60-70% for height and 30-40% for BMI. Therefore, the missing heritability is small for both traits. For further discovery of genes associated with complex traits, a study design with SNP arrays followed by imputation is more cost-effective than whole-genome sequencing at current prices.",Nature genetics,2015,"Body Height; Body Mass Index; Genetic Variation; Genome, Human; Humans",False,9
Estonian Biobank,26427027,Functional Impact and Evolution of a Novel Human Polymorphic Inversion That Disrupts a Gene and Creates a Fusion Transcript.,"Despite many years of study into inversions, very little is known about their functional consequences, especially in humans. A common hypothesis is that the selective value of inversions stems in part from their effects on nearby genes, although evidence of this in natural populations is almost nonexistent. Here we present a global analysis of a new 415-kb polymorphic inversion that is among the longest ones found in humans and is the first with clear position effects. This inversion is located in chromosome 19 and has been generated by non-homologous end joining between blocks of transposable elements with low identity. PCR genotyping in 541 individuals from eight different human populations allowed the detection of tag SNPs and inversion genotyping in multiple populations worldwide, showing that the inverted allele is mainly found in East Asia with an average frequency of 4.7%. Interestingly, one of the breakpoints disrupts the transcription factor gene ZNF257, causing a significant reduction in the total expression level of this gene in lymphoblastoid cell lines. RNA-Seq analysis of the effects of this expression change in standard homozygotes and inversion heterozygotes revealed distinct expression patterns that were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Moreover, we have found a new fusion transcript that is generated exclusively from inverted chromosomes around one of the breakpoints. Finally, by the analysis of the associated nucleotide variation, we have estimated that the inversion was generated ~40,000-50,000 years ago and, while a neutral evolution cannot be ruled out, its current frequencies are more consistent with those expected for a deleterious variant, although no significant association with phenotypic traits has been found so far.",PLoS genetics,2015,"Chromosome Breakpoints; Chromosome Inversion; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19; DNA End-Joining Repair; DNA Transposable Elements; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Transcription Factors",False,9
Estonian Biobank,25649076,A functional brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene variant increases the risk of moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis.,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a secretory protein that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis (AR), atopic asthma, and eczema, but it is currently unknown whether BDNF polymorphisms influence susceptibility to moderate-to-severe AR. We sought to identify disease associations and the functional effect of BDNF genetic variants in patients with moderate-to-severe AR. Tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the BDNF gene were selected from the human HapMap Han Chinese from Beijing (CHB) data set, and associations with moderate-to-severe AR were assessed in 2 independent cohorts of Chinese patients (2216 from Shandong province and 1239 living in Singapore). The functional effects of the BDNF genetic variants were determined by using both in vitro and ex vivo assays. The tagging SNP rs10767664 was significantly associated with the risk of moderate-to-severe AR in both Singapore Chinese (P = .0017; odds ratio, 1.324) and Shandong Chinese populations (P = .039; odds ratio, 1.180). The coding nonsynonymous SNP rs6265 was in perfect linkage with rs10767664 and conferred increased BDNF protein secretion by a human cell line in vitro. Subjects bearing the AA genotype of rs10767664 exhibited increased risk of moderate-to-severe AR and displayed increased BDNF protein and total IgE levels in plasma. Using a large-scale expression quantitative trait locus study, we demonstrated that BDNF SNPs are significantly associated with altered BDNF concentrations in peripheral blood. A common genetic variant of the BDNF gene is associated with increased risk of moderate-to-severe AR, and the AA genotype is associated with increased BDNF mRNA levels in peripheral blood.

The sentinel blood pressure SNPs are enriched for association with DNA methylation at multiple nearby CpG sites, suggesting that, at some of the loci identified, DNA methylation may lie on the regulatory pathway linking sequence variation to blood pressure.

Here we test two overlooked sources of variation in 192,974 European ancestry women: low-frequency protein-coding variants and X-chromosome variants. Five missense/nonsense variants (in ALMS1/LAMB2/TNRC6A/TACR3/PRKAG1) are associated with age at menarche (minor allele frequencies 0.08-4.6%; effect sizes 0.08-1.25 years per allele; P<5 × 10(-8)). In addition, we identify common X-chromosome loci at IGSF1 (rs762080, P=9.4 × 10(-13)) and FAAH2 (rs5914101, P=4.9 × 10(-10)). Highlighted genes implicate cellular energy homeostasis, post-transcriptional gene silencing and fatty-acid amide signalling. A frequently reported mutation in TACR3 for idiopathic hypogonatrophic hypogonadism (p.W275X) is associated with 1.25-year-later menarche (P=2.8 × 10(-11)), illustrating the utility of population studies to estimate the penetrance of reportedly pathogenic mutations.

We aimed to investigate if these associations are causal, using Mendelian randomization (MR) methods. The associations of BMI with cardiovascular outcomes [coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure and ischaemic stroke], and associations of a genetic score (32 BMI single nucleotide polymorphisms) with BMI and cardiovascular outcomes were examined in up to 22,193 individuals with 3062 incident cardiovascular events from nine prospective follow-up studies within the ENGAGE consortium. We used random-effects meta-analysis in an MR framework to provide causal estimates of the effect of adiposity on cardiovascular outcomes. There was a strong association between BMI and incident CHD (HR = 1.20 per SD-increase of BMI, 95% CI, 1.12-1.28, P = 1.9.10(-7)), heart failure (HR = 1.47, 95% CI, 1.35-1.60, P = 9.10(-19)) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 1.15, 95% CI, 1.06-1.24, P = 0.0008) in observational analyses.

Estonian Biobank,25917368,"The association between lower educational attainment and depression owing to shared genetic effects? Results in ~25,000 subjects.","An association between lower educational attainment (EA) and an increased risk for depression has been confirmed in various western countries. This study examines whether pleiotropic genetic effects contribute to this association. Therefore, data were analyzed from a total of 9662 major depressive disorder (MDD) cases and 14,949 controls (with no lifetime MDD diagnosis) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium with additional Dutch and Estonian data. The association of EA and MDD was assessed with logistic regression in 15,138 individuals indicating a significantly negative association in our sample with an odds ratio for MDD 0.78 (0.75-0.82) per standard deviation increase in EA. With data of 884,105 autosomal common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), three methods were applied to test for pleiotropy between MDD and EA: (i) genetic profile risk scores (GPRS) derived from training data for EA (independent meta-analysis on ~120,000 subjects) and MDD (using a 10-fold leave-one-out procedure in the current sample), (ii) bivariate genomic-relationship-matrix restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) and (iii) SNP effect concordance analysis (SECA). With these methods, we found (i) that the EA-GPRS did not predict MDD status, and MDD-GPRS did not predict EA, (ii) a weak negative genetic correlation with bivariate GREML analyses, but this correlation was not consistently significant, (iii) no evidence for concordance of MDD and EA SNP effects with SECA analysis. To conclude, our study confirms an association of lower EA and MDD risk, but this association was not because of measurable pleiotropic genetic effects, which suggests that environmental factors could be involved, for example, socioeconomic status.",Molecular psychiatry,2015,"Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Depressive Disorder, Major; Educational Status; Estonia; Female; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genetic Association Studies; Genotype; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Male; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Odds Ratio; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Regression Analysis",False,4
Estonian Biobank,26251408,Effects of metformin on metabolite profiles and LDL cholesterol in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Metformin is used as a first-line oral treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we aimed to comprehensively investigate the pleiotropic effects of metformin. We analyzed both metabolomic and genomic data of the population-based KORA cohort. To evaluate the effect of metformin treatment on metabolite concentrations, we quantified 131 metabolites in fasting serum samples and used multivariable linear regression models in three independent cross-sectional studies (n = 151 patients with T2D treated with metformin [mt-T2D]). Additionally, we used linear mixed-effect models to study the longitudinal KORA samples (n = 912) and performed mediation analyses to investigate the effects of metformin intake on blood lipid profiles. We combined genotyping data with the identified metformin-associated metabolites in KORA individuals (n = 1,809) and explored the underlying pathways. We found significantly lower (P < 5.0E-06) concentrations of three metabolites (acyl-alkyl phosphatidylcholines [PCs]) when comparing mt-T2D with four control groups who were not using glucose-lowering oral medication. These findings were controlled for conventional risk factors of T2D and replicated in two independent studies. Furthermore, we observed that the levels of these metabolites decreased significantly in patients after they started metformin treatment during 7 years' follow-up. The reduction of these metabolites was also associated with a lowered blood level of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Variations of these three metabolites were significantly associated with 17 genes (including FADS1 and FADS2) and controlled by AMPK, a metformin target. Our results indicate that metformin intake activates AMPK and consequently suppresses FADS, which leads to reduced levels of the three acyl-alkyl PCs and LDL-C. Our findings suggest potential beneficial effects of metformin in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.",Diabetes care,2015,"Aged; Cholesterol, LDL; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delta-5 Fatty Acid Desaturase; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Angiopathies; Fasting; Fatty Acid Desaturases; Female; Genomics; Genotype; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Metabolomics; Metformin; Middle Aged; Risk Factors",False,0
Estonian Biobank,26470795,Extensive alterations of the whole-blood transcriptome are associated with body mass index: results of an mRNA profiling study involving two large population-based cohorts.,"Obesity, defined as pathologically increased body mass index (BMI), is strongly related to an increased risk for numerous common cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. It is particularly associated with insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and systemic oxidative stress and represents the most important risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these associations are still not completely understood. Therefore, in order to identify potentially disease-relevant BMI-associated gene expression signatures, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) on BMI was performed. Whole-blood mRNA levels determined by array-based transcriptional profiling were correlated with BMI in two large independent population-based cohort studies (KORA F4 and SHIP-TREND) comprising a total of 1977 individuals. Extensive alterations of the whole-blood transcriptome were associated with BMI: More than 3500 transcripts exhibited significant positive or negative BMI-correlation. Three major whole-blood gene expression signatures associated with increased BMI were identified. The three signatures suggested: i) a ratio shift from mature erythrocytes towards reticulocytes, ii) decreased expression of several genes essentially involved in the transmission and amplification of the insulin signal, and iii) reduced expression of several key genes involved in the defence against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Whereas the first signature confirms published results, the other two provide possible mechanistic explanations for well-known epidemiological findings under conditions of increased BMI, namely attenuated insulin signaling and increased oxidative stress. The putatively causative BMI-dependent down-regulation of the expression of numerous genes on the mRNA level represents a novel finding. BMI-associated negative transcriptional regulation of insulin signaling and oxidative stress management provide new insights into the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and T2D.",BMC medical genomics,2015,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blood; Body Mass Index; Cohort Studies; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Insulin; Male; Middle Aged; Oxidative Stress; RNA, Messenger; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reticulocytes; Signal Transduction",False,0

We sought to identify genetic variants conferring risk to NSTEMI or STEMI by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MI stratified into NSTEMI and STEMI in a consecutive sample of 1,579 acute MI cases with 1,576 controls. Subsequently, we followed the results in an independent population-based sample of 562 cases and 566 controls, a partially independent prospective cohort (N = 16,627 with 163 incident NSTEMI cases), and examined the effect of disease-associated variants on gene expression in 513 healthy participants. Genetic variants on chromosome 1p13.3 near the damage-regulated autophagy modulator 2 gene DRAM2 associated with NSTEMI (rs656843; odds ratio 1.57, P = 3.11 × 10(-10)) in the case-control analysis with a consistent but not statistically significant effect in the prospective cohort (rs656843; hazard ratio 1.13, P = 0.43). These variants were not associated with STEMI (rs656843; odds ratio, 1.11, P = 0.20; hazard ratio 0.97, P = 0.87), appearing to have a pronounced effect on NSTEMI risk.

We identified 49 distinct association signals at these loci, including five mapping in or near KCNQ1. 'Credible sets' of the variants most likely to drive each distinct signal mapped predominantly to noncoding sequence, implying that association with T2D is mediated through gene regulation. Credible set variants were enriched for overlap with FOXA2 chromatin immunoprecipitation binding sites in human islet and liver cells, including at MTNR1B, where fine mapping implicated rs10830963 as driving T2D association. We confirmed that the T2D risk allele for this SNP increases FOXA2-bound enhancer activity in islet- and liver-derived cells. We observed allele-specific differences in NEUROD1 binding in islet-derived cells, consistent with evidence that the T2D risk allele increases islet MTNR1B expression.

This finding implies that the SNP has strong pleiotropic effects on adiposity and adiposity-independent pathological pathways that leads to increased mortality. To investigate this further, we conducted a meta-analysis of similar data from 34 longitudinal studies including 169,551 adult Caucasians among whom 27,100 died during follow-up. Linear regression showed that the minor allele of the FTO SNP was associated with greater BMI (n = 169,551; 0.32 kg m(-2) ; 95% CI 0.28-0.32, P < 1 × 10(-32) ), WC (n = 152,631; 0.76 cm; 0.68-0.84, P < 1 × 10(-32) ) and FMI (n = 48,192; 0.17 kg m(-2) ; 0.13-0.22, P = 1.0 × 10(-13) ). Cox proportional hazard regression analyses for mortality showed that the hazards ratio (HR) for the minor allele of the FTO SNPs was 1.02 (1.00-1.04, P = 0.097), but the apparent excess risk was eliminated after adjustment for BMI and WC (HR: 1.00; 0.98-1.03, P = 0.662) and for FMI (HR: 1.00; 0.96-1.04, P = 0.932).

Here, to test the hypothesis that lower-frequency variants explain much of the remainder, the GoT2D and T2D-GENES consortia performed whole-genome sequencing in 2,657 European individuals with and without diabetes, and exome sequencing in 12,940 individuals from five ancestry groups. To increase statistical power, we expanded the sample size via genotyping and imputation in a further 111,548 subjects. Variants associated with type 2 diabetes after sequencing were overwhelmingly common and most fell within regions previously identified by genome-wide association studies.

In situ perturbation of this enhancer by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells demonstrated that it is necessary for and specifically regulates CEBPA expression during basophil differentiation. We additionally identified basophil count-associated variation at another more pleiotropic myeloid enhancer near GATA2, highlighting regulatory mechanisms for ordered expression of master hematopoietic regulators during lineage specification. Our study illustrates how population-based genetic studies can provide key insights into poorly understood cell differentiation processes of considerable physiologic relevance.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2017,"Base Sequence; Basophils; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Chromosome Mapping; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Epigenesis, Genetic; Estonia; Female; GATA2 Transcription Factor; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genome-Wide Association Study; Hematopoiesis; Humans; Leukocyte Count; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Whole Genome Sequencing",False,9
Estonian Biobank,27007234,Evidence for Genetic Overlap Between Schizophrenia and Age at First Birth in Women.,"A recently published study of national data by McGrath et al in 2014 showed increased risk of schizophrenia (SCZ) in offspring associated with both early and delayed parental age, consistent with a U-shaped relationship. However, it remains unclear if the risk to the child is due to psychosocial factors associated with parental age or if those at higher risk for SCZ tend to have children at an earlier or later age. To determine if there is a genetic association between SCZ and age at first birth (AFB) using genetically informative but independently ascertained data sets. This investigation used multiple independent genome-wide association study data sets. The SCZ sample comprised 18 957 SCZ cases and 22 673 controls in a genome-wide association study from the second phase of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, and the AFB sample comprised 12 247 genotyped women measured for AFB from the following 4 community cohorts: Estonia (Estonian Genome Center Biobank, University of Tartu), the Netherlands (LifeLines Cohort Study), Sweden (Swedish Twin Registry), and the United Kingdom (TwinsUK). Schizophrenia genetic risk for each woman in the AFB community sample was estimated using genetic effects inferred from the SCZ genome-wide association study. We tested if SCZ genetic risk was a significant predictor of response variables based on published polynomial functions that described the relationship between maternal age and SCZ risk in offspring in Denmark. We substituted AFB for maternal age in these functions, one of which was corrected for the age of the father, and found that the fit was superior for the model without adjustment for the father's age. We observed a U-shaped relationship between SCZ risk and AFB in the community cohorts, consistent with the previously reported relationship between SCZ risk in offspring and maternal age when not adjusted for the age of the father. We confirmed that SCZ risk profile scores significantly predicted the response variables (coefficient of determination R2 = 1.1E-03, P = 4.1E-04), reflecting the published relationship between maternal age and SCZ risk in offspring by McGrath et al in 2014. This study provides evidence for a significant overlap between genetic factors associated with risk of SCZ and genetic factors associated with AFB. It has been reported that SCZ risk associated with increased maternal age is explained by the age of the father and that de novo mutations that occur more frequently in the germline of older men are the underlying causal mechanism. This explanation may need to be revised if, as suggested herein and if replicated in future studies, there is also increased genetic risk of SCZ in older mothers.",JAMA psychiatry,2016,Adult; Alleles; Birth Order; Cohort Studies; Denmark; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Maternal Age; Phenotype; Pregnancy; Risk; Schizophrenia,False,5
Estonian Biobank,27513194,Personalized risk prediction for type 2 diabetes: the potential of genetic risk scores.,"Using effect estimates from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified a genetic risk score (GRS) that has the strongest association with type 2 diabetes (T2D) status in a population-based cohort and investigated its potential for prospective T2D risk assessment. By varying the number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their respective weights, alternative versions of GRS can be computed. They were tested in 1,181 T2D cases and 9,092 controls of the Estonian Biobank cohort. The best-fitting GRS was chosen for the subsequent analysis of incident T2D (386 cases). The best fit was provided by a novel doubly weighted GRS that captures the effect of 1,000 SNPs. The hazard for incident T2D was 3.45 times (95% CI: 2.31-5.17) higher in the highest GRS quintile compared with the lowest quintile, after adjusting for body mass index and other known predictors. Adding GRS to the prediction model for 5-year T2D risk resulted in continuous net reclassification improvement of 0.324 (95% CI: 0.211-0.444). In addition, a significant effect of the GRS on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was observed. The proposed GRS would improve the accuracy of T2D risk prediction when added to the currently used set of predictors.Genet Med 19 3, 322-329.",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2017,"Alleles; Body Mass Index; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Testing; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Precision Medicine; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors",False,0
Estonian Biobank,27764105,Genome-Wide Meta-Analysis of Sciatica in Finnish Population.,"Sciatica or the sciatic syndrome is a common and often disabling low back disorder in the working-age population. It has a relatively high heritability but poorly understood molecular mechanisms. The Finnish population is a genetic isolate where small founder population and bottleneck events have led to enrichment of certain rare and low frequency variants. We performed here the first genome-wide association (GWAS) and meta-analysis of sciatica. The meta-analysis was conducted across two GWAS covering 291 Finnish sciatica cases and 3671 controls genotyped and imputed at 7.7 million autosomal variants. The most promising loci (p<1x10-6) were replicated in 776 Finnish sciatica patients and 18,489 controls. We identified five intragenic variants, with relatively low frequencies, at two novel loci associated with sciatica at genome-wide significance. These included chr9:14344410:I (rs71321981) at 9p22.3 (NFIB gene; p = 1.30x10-8, MAF = 0.08) and four variants at 15q21.2: rs145901849, rs80035109, rs190200374 and rs117458827 (MYO5A; p = 1.34x10-8, MAF = 0.06; p = 2.32x10-8, MAF = 0.07; p = 3.85x10-8, MAF = 0.06; p = 4.78x10-8, MAF = 0.07, respectively). The most significant association in the meta-analysis, a single base insertion rs71321981 within the regulatory region of the transcription factor NFIB, replicated in an independent Finnish population sample (p = 0.04). Despite identifying 15q21.2 as a promising locus, we were not able to replicate it. It was differentiated; the lead variants within 15q21.2 were more frequent in Finland (6-7%) than in other European populations (1-2%). Imputation accuracies of the three significantly associated variants (chr9:14344410:I, rs190200374, and rs80035109) were validated by genotyping. In summary, our results suggest a novel locus, 9p22.3 (NFIB), which may be involved in susceptibility to sciatica. In addition, another locus, 15q21.2, emerged as a promising one, but failed to replicate.",PloS one,2016,"Case-Control Studies; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9; Databases, Factual; Disease Susceptibility; Finland; Gene Frequency; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; NFI Transcription Factors; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sciatica; White People",False,6
Estonian Biobank,27659466,52 Genetic Loci Influencing Myocardial Mass.,"Myocardial mass is a key determinant of cardiac muscle function and hypertrophy. Myocardial depolarization leading to cardiac muscle contraction is reflected by the amplitude and duration of the QRS complex on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Abnormal QRS amplitude or duration reflect changes in myocardial mass and conduction, and are associated with increased risk of heart failure and death. This meta-analysis sought to gain insights into the genetic determinants of myocardial mass. We carried out a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 4 QRS traits in up to 73,518 individuals of European ancestry, followed by extensive biological and functional assessment. We identified 52 genomic loci, of which 32 are novel, that are reliably associated with 1 or more QRS phenotypes at p < 1 × 10(-8). These loci are enriched in regions of open chromatin, histone modifications, and transcription factor binding, suggesting that they represent regions of the genome that are actively transcribed in the human heart. Pathway analyses provided evidence that these loci play a role in cardiac hypertrophy. We further highlighted 67 candidate genes at the identified loci that are preferentially expressed in cardiac tissue and associated with cardiac abnormalities in Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus. We validated the regulatory function of a novel variant in the SCN5A/SCN10A locus in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings provide new insights into genes and biological pathways controlling myocardial mass and may help identify novel therapeutic targets.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2016,Animals; Cardiomegaly; Genetic Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans,False,6

When the total population of 689 mice was examined together, several taxa exhibited significant differences in abundance between sexes but a larger number of differences were observed at the single strain level, suggesting that sex differences can be obscured by host genetics and environmental factors. We also examined a subset of mice on chow and high fat diets and observed sex-by-diet interactions. We further investigated the sex differences using gonadectomized and hormone treated mice from 3 different inbred strains. Principal coordinate analysis with unweighted UniFrac distances revealed very clear effects of gonadectomy and hormone replacement on microbiota composition in all 3 strains. Moreover, bile acid analyses showed gender-specific differences as well as effects of gonodectomy, providing one possible mechanism mediating sex differences in microbiota composition.",Gut microbes,2016,Animals; Bile Acids and Salts; Feeding Behavior; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gastrointestinal Tract; Hormones; Male; Mice; Sex Factors,False,7

Estonian Biobank,27103211,Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Ischemic Heart Disease: Is the Confluence of Risk Factors Greater Than the Parts? A Genetic Approach.,"Cardiovascular risk factors tend to aggregate. The biological and predictive value of this aggregation is questioned and genetics could shed light on this debate. Our aims were to reappraise the impact of risk factor confluence on ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk by testing whether genetic risk scores (GRSs) associated with these factors interact on an additive or multiplicative scale, and to determine whether these interactions provide additional value for predicting IHD risk. We selected genetic variants associated with blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, triglycerides, type-2 diabetes mellitus, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and IHD to create GRSs for each factor. We tested and meta-analyzed the impact of additive (synergy index) and multiplicative (βinteraction) interactions between each GRS pair in 1 case-control (n=6042) and 4 cohort studies (n=17 794) and evaluated the predictive value of these interactions. We observed 2 multiplicative interactions: GRSLDL·GRSTriglycerides (βinteraction=-0.096; SE=0.028) and nonpleiotropic GRSIHD·GRSLDL (βinteraction=0.091; SE=0.028). Inclusion of these interaction terms did not improve predictive capacity. The confluence of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides genetic risk load has an additive effect on IHD risk. The interaction between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and IHD genetic load is more than multiplicative, supporting the hazardous impact on atherosclerosis progression of the combination of inflammation and increased lipid levels. The capacity of risk factor confluence to improve IHD risk prediction is questionable. Further studies in larger samples are warranted to confirm and expand our results.",Circulation.

Estonian Biobank,27301361,Copy number variation analysis detects novel candidate genes involved in follicular growth and oocyte maturation in a cohort of premature ovarian failure cases.,"Can spontaneous premature ovarian failure (POF) patients derived from population-based biobanks reveal the association between copy number variations (CNVs) and POF? CNVs can hamper the functional capacity of ovaries by disrupting key genes and pathways essential for proper ovarian function. POF is defined as the cessation of ovarian function before the age of 40 years. POF is a major reason for female infertility, although its cause remains largely unknown. The current retrospective CNV study included 301 spontaneous POF patients and 3188 control individuals registered between 2003 and 2014 at Estonian Genome Center at the University of Tartu (EGCUT) biobank. DNA samples from 301 spontaneous POF patients were genotyped by Illumina HumanCoreExome (258 samples) and HumanOmniExpress (43 samples) BeadChip arrays. Genotype and phenotype information was drawn from the EGCUT for the 3188 control population samples, previously genotyped with HumanCNV370 and HumanOmniExpress BeadChip arrays. All identified CNVs were subjected to functional enrichment studies for highlighting the POF pathogenesis. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to validate a subset of CNVs. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on six patients carrying hemizygous deletions that encompass genes essential for meiosis or folliculogenesis. Eleven novel microdeletions and microduplications that encompass genes relevant to POF were identified. For example, FMN2 (1q43) and SGOL2 (2q33.1) are essential for meiotic progression, while TBP (6q27), SCARB1 (12q24.31), BNC1 (15q25) and ARFGAP3 (22q13.2) are involved in follicular growth and oocyte maturation. The importance of recently discovered hemizygous microdeletions of meiotic genes SYCE1 (10q26.3) and CPEB1 (15q25.2) in POF patients was also corroborated. This is a descriptive analysis and no functional studies were performed. Anamnestic data obtained from population-based biobank lacked clinical, biological (hormone levels) or ultrasonographical data, and spontaneous POF was predicted retrospectively by excluding known extraovarian causes for premature menopause. The present study, with high number of spontaneous POF cases, provides novel data on associations between the genomic aberrations and premature menopause of ovarian cause and demonstrates that population-based biobanks are powerful source of biological samples and clinical data to reveal novel genetic lesions associated with human reproductive health and disease, including POF.

Detailed molecular profiles (87 metabolic measures and 37 cytokines) were measured for up to 4260 women (24-49 years, 322 pregnant) from three population-based cohorts in Finland. Circulating molecular concentrations in pregnant women were compared to those in non-pregnant women. Metabolic profiles were also reassessed for 583 women 6 years later to uncover the longitudinal metabolic changes in response to change in the pregnancy status. Compared to non-pregnant women, all lipoprotein subclasses and lipids were markedly increased in pregnant women. The most pronounced differences were observed for the intermediate-density, low-density and high-density lipoprotein triglyceride concentrations. Large differences were also seen for many fatty acids and amino acids. Pregnant women also had higher concentrations of low-grade inflammatory marker glycoprotein acetyls, higher concentrations of interleukin-18 and lower concentrations of interleukin-12p70. The changes in metabolic concentrations for women who were not pregnant at baseline but pregnant 6 years later (or vice versa) matched (or were mirror-images of) the cross-sectional association pattern. Cross-sectional results were consistent across the three cohorts and similar longitudinal changes were seen for 653 women in 4-year and 497 women in 10-year follow-up. For multiple metabolic measures, the changes increased in magnitude across the three trimesters. Pregnancy initiates substantial metabolic and inflammatory changes in the mothers. Comprehensive characterisation of normal pregnancy is important for gaining understanding of the key nutrients for fetal growth and development.

Estonian Biobank,27538888,Effects of hormonal contraception on systemic metabolism: cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence.,"Hormonal contraception is commonly used worldwide, but its systemic effects across lipoprotein subclasses, fatty acids, circulating metabolites and cytokines remain poorly understood. A comprehensive molecular profile (75 metabolic measures and 37 cytokines) was measured for up to 5841 women (age range 24-49 years) from three population-based cohorts. Women using combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) or progestin-only contraceptives (POCs) were compared with those who did not use hormonal contraception. Metabolomics profiles were reassessed for 869 women after 6 years to uncover the metabolic effects of starting, stopping and persistently using hormonal contraception. The comprehensive molecular profiling allowed multiple new findings on the metabolic associations with the use of COCPs. They were positively associated with lipoprotein subclasses, including all high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subclasses. The associations with fatty acids and amino acids were strong and variable in direction. COCP use was negatively associated with albumin and positively associated with creatinine and inflammatory markers, including glycoprotein acetyls and several growth factors and interleukins. Our findings also confirmed previous results e.g. for increased circulating triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. Starting COCPs caused similar metabolic changes to those observed cross-sectionally: the changes were maintained in consistent users and normalized in those who stopped using. In contrast, POCs were only weakly associated with metabolic and inflammatory markers. Results were consistent across all cohorts and for different COCP preparations and different types of POC delivery. Use of COCPs causes widespread metabolic and inflammatory effects. However, persistent use does not appear to accumulate the effects over time and the metabolic perturbations are reversed upon discontinuation.

Estonian Biobank,26620891,16p11.2 Locus modulates response to satiety before the onset of obesity.,"The 600 kb BP4-BP5 copy number variants (CNVs) at the 16p11.2 locus have been associated with a range of neurodevelopmental conditions including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. The number of genomic copies in this region is inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI): the deletion is associated with a highly penetrant form of obesity (present in 50% of carriers by the age of 7 years and in 70% of adults), and the duplication with being underweight. Mechanisms underlying this energy imbalance remain unknown. This study aims to investigate eating behavior, cognitive traits and their relationships with BMI in carriers of 16p11.2 CNVs. We assessed individuals carrying a 16p11.2 deletion or duplication and their intrafamilial controls using food-related behavior questionnaires and cognitive measures. We also compared these carriers with cohorts of individuals presenting with obesity, binge eating disorder or bulimia. Response to satiety is gene dosage-dependent in pediatric CNV carriers. Altered satiety response is present in young deletion carriers before the onset of obesity. It remains altered in adolescent carriers and correlates with obesity. Adult deletion carriers exhibit eating behavior similar to that seen in a cohort of obesity without eating disorders such as bulimia or binge eating. None of the cognitive measures are associated with eating behavior or BMI. These findings suggest that abnormal satiety response is a strong contributor to the energy imbalance in 16p11.2 CNV carriers, and, akin to other genetic forms of obesity, altered satiety responsiveness in children precedes the increase in BMI observed later in adolescence.",International journal of obesity (2005),2016,"Adult; Autistic Disorder; Body Mass Index; Case-Control Studies; Child; Chromosome Deletion; Chromosome Disorders; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16; Cognitive Dysfunction; DNA Copy Number Variations; Energy Metabolism; Executive Function; Feeding Behavior; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Male; Obesity; Phenotype; Satiation; Sequence Deletion; Switzerland",False,6
Estonian Biobank,27163203,Candidate gene networks and blood biomarkers of methamphetamine-associated psychosis: an integrative RNA-sequencing report.,"The clinical presentation, course and treatment of methamphetamine (METH)-associated psychosis (MAP) are similar to that observed in schizophrenia (SCZ) and subsequently MAP has been hypothesized as a pharmacological and environmental model of SCZ. However, several challenges currently exist in diagnosing MAP accurately at the molecular and neurocognitive level before the MAP model can contribute to the discovery of SCZ biomarkers. We directly assessed subcortical brain structural volumes and clinical parameters of MAP within the framework of an integrative genome-wide RNA-Seq blood transcriptome analysis of subjects diagnosed with MAP (N=10), METH dependency without psychosis (MA; N=10) and healthy controls (N=10). First, we identified discrete groups of co-expressed genes (that is, modules) and tested them for functional annotation and phenotypic relationships to brain structure volumes, life events and psychometric measurements. We discovered one MAP-associated module involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis downregulation, enriched with 61 genes previously found implicated in psychosis and SCZ across independent blood and post-mortem brain studies using convergent functional genomic (CFG) evidence. This module demonstrated significant relationships with brain structure volumes including the anterior corpus callosum (CC) and the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, a second MAP and psychoticism-associated module involved in circadian clock upregulation was also enriched with 39 CFG genes, further associated with the CC. Subsequently, a machine-learning analysis of differentially expressed genes identified single blood-based biomarkers able to differentiate controls from methamphetamine dependents with 87% accuracy and MAP from MA subjects with 95% accuracy. CFG evidence validated a significant proportion of these putative MAP biomarkers in independent studies including CLN3, FBP1, TBC1D2 and ZNF821 (RNA degradation), ELK3 and SINA3 (circadian clock) and PIGF and UHMK1 (ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis). Finally, focusing analysis on brain structure volumes revealed significantly lower bilateral hippocampal volumes in MAP subjects. Overall, these results suggest similar molecular and neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of psychosis and SCZ regardless of substance abuse and provide preliminary evidence supporting the MAP paradigm as an exemplar for SCZ biomarker discovery.",Translational psychiatry,2016,"Adult; Amphetamine-Related Disorders; Biomarkers; Brain; Female; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Methamphetamine; Psychoses, Substance-Induced; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Young Adult",False,4

Among the hypermethylated CpG sites, we specifically found enrichment of genes involved in T cell signaling (CD247, LCK, ZAP70, CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CTLA4 and CD8A) and decreased expression of CD3 gene family members. The hypermethylation was accompanied with decreased levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac marks at several T cell signaling genes in ChIP-seq analysis.

Estonian Biobank,27142678,Genetic variants in RBFOX3 are associated with sleep latency.,"Time to fall asleep (sleep latency) is a major determinant of sleep quality. Chronic, long sleep latency is a major characteristic of sleep-onset insomnia and/or delayed sleep phase syndrome. In this study we aimed to discover common polymorphisms that contribute to the genetics of sleep latency. We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) including 2 572 737 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) established in seven European cohorts including 4242 individuals. We found a cluster of three highly correlated variants (rs9900428, rs9907432 and rs7211029) in the RNA-binding protein fox-1 homolog 3 gene (RBFOX3) associated with sleep latency (P-values=5.77 × 10(-08), 6.59 × 10(-)(08) and 9.17 × 10(-)(08)).

A functional prediction of RBFOX3 based on co-expression with other genes shows that this gene is predominantly expressed in brain (P-value=1.4 × 10(-316)) and the central nervous system (P-value=7.5 × 10(-)(321)). The predicted function of RBFOX3 based on co-expression analysis with other genes shows that this gene is significantly involved in the release cycle of neurotransmitters including gamma-aminobutyric acid and various monoamines (P-values<2.9 × 10(-11)) that are crucial in triggering the onset of sleep. To conclude, in this first large-scale GWAS of sleep latency we report a novel association of variants in RBFOX3 gene.

Sixteen variants were associated with chronotype (P<5x10-8), including variants near the known circadian rhythm genes RGS16 (1.21 odds of morningness, 95% CI [1.15, 1.27], P = 3x10-12) and PER2 (1.09 odds of morningness, 95% CI [1.06, 1.12], P = 4x10-10). The PER2 signal has previously been associated with iris function. We sought replication using self-reported data from 89,283 23andMe participants; thirteen of the chronotype signals remained associated at P<5x10-8 on meta-analysis and eleven of these reached P<0.05 in the same direction in the 23andMe study. We also replicated 9 additional variants identified when the 23andMe study was used as a discovery GWAS of chronotype (all P<0.05 and meta-analysis P<5x10-8). For sleep duration, we replicated one known signal in PAX8 (2.6 minutes per allele, 95% CI [1.9, 3.2], P = 5.7x10-16) and identified and replicated two novel associations at VRK2 (2.0 minutes per allele, 95% CI [1.3, 2.7], P = 1.2x10-9; and 1.6 minutes per allele, 95% CI [1.1, 2.2], P = 7.6x10-9). Although we found genetic correlation between chronotype and BMI (rG = 0.056, P = 0.05); undersleeping and BMI (rG = 0.147, P = 1x10-5) and oversleeping and BMI (rG = 0.097, P = 0.04), Mendelian Randomisation analyses, with limited power, provided no consistent evidence of causal associations between BMI or type 2 diabetes and chronotype or sleep duration. Our study brings the total number of loci associated with chronotype to 22 and with sleep duration to three, and provides new insights into the biology of sleep and circadian rhythms in humans.",PLoS genetics,2016,"Body Mass Index; Circadian Rhythm; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Obesity; PAX8 Transcription Factor; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Sleep; White People",False,6
Estonian Biobank,27853181,Selective sweep on human amylase genes postdates the split with Neanderthals.,"Humans have more copies of amylase genes than other primates. It is still poorly understood, however, when the copy number expansion occurred and whether its spread was enhanced by selection. Here we assess amylase copy numbers in a global sample of 480 high coverage genomes and find that regions flanking the amylase locus show notable depression of genetic diversity both in African and non-African populations. Analysis of genetic variation in these regions supports the model of an early selective sweep in the human lineage after the split of humans from Neanderthals which led to the fixation of multiple copies of AMY1 in place of a single copy. We find evidence of multiple secondary losses of copy number with the highest frequency (52%) of a deletion of AMY2A and associated low copy number of AMY1 in Northeast Siberian populations whose diet has been low in starch content.",Scientific reports,2016,"Amylases; Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Gene Dosage; Genetic Variation; Genome, Human; Humans; Male; Neanderthals",False,9

Due to its widespread use, the metabolic and health impact of milk consumption warrants further investigation and biomarkers would aid epidemiological studies. Milk intake assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire was analyzed against fasting blood metabolomic profiles from two metabolomic platforms in females from the TwinsUK cohort (n = 3559). The top metabolites were then replicated in two independent populations (EGCUT, n = 1109 and KORA, n = 1593), and the results from all cohorts were meta-analyzed. Four metabolites were significantly associated with milk intake in the TwinsUK cohort after adjustment for multiple testing (P < 8.08 × 10 We identified and replicated in independent populations four novel biomarkers of milk intake: trimethyl-N-aminovalerate, uridine, hydroxysphingomyelin C14:1 and diacylphosphatidylcholine C28:1.

Estonian Biobank,27023175,Genome-wide association study of lifetime cannabis use based on a large meta-analytic sample of 32 330 subjects from the International Cannabis Consortium.,"Cannabis is the most widely produced and consumed illicit psychoactive substance worldwide. Occasional cannabis use can progress to frequent use, abuse and dependence with all known adverse physical, psychological and social consequences. Individual differences in cannabis initiation are heritable (40-48%). The International Cannabis Consortium was established with the aim to identify genetic risk variants of cannabis use. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data of 13 cohorts (N=32 330) and four replication samples (N=5627). In addition, we performed a gene-based test of association, estimated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability and explored the genetic correlation between lifetime cannabis use and cigarette use using LD score regression. No individual SNPs reached genome-wide significance. Nonetheless, gene-based tests identified four genes significantly associated with lifetime cannabis use: NCAM1, CADM2, SCOC and KCNT2. Previous studies reported associations of NCAM1 with cigarette smoking and other substance use, and those of CADM2 with body mass index, processing speed and autism disorders, which are phenotypes previously reported to be associated with cannabis use. Furthermore, we showed that, combined across the genome, all common SNPs explained 13-20% (P<0.001) of the liability of lifetime cannabis use. Finally, there was a strong genetic correlation (rg=0.83; P=1.85 × 10(-8)) between lifetime cannabis use and lifetime cigarette smoking implying that the SNP effect sizes of the two traits are highly correlated. This is the largest meta-analysis of cannabis GWA studies to date, revealing important new insights into the genetic pathways of lifetime cannabis use.

Estonian Biobank,27580049,Identifying Cases of Type 2 Diabetes in Heterogeneous Data Sources: Strategy from the EMIF Project.,"Due to the heterogeneity of existing European sources of observational healthcare data, data source-tailored choices are needed to execute multi-data source, multi-national epidemiological studies. This makes transparent documentation paramount. In this proof-of-concept study, a novel standard data derivation procedure was tested in a set of heterogeneous data sources. Identification of subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) was the test case. We included three primary care data sources (PCDs), three record linkage of administrative and/or registry data sources (RLDs), one hospital and one biobank. Overall, data from 12 million subjects from six European countries were extracted. Based on a shared event definition, sixteeen standard algorithms (components) useful to identify T2DM cases were generated through a top-down/bottom-up iterative approach. Each component was based on one single data domain among diagnoses, drugs, diagnostic test utilization and laboratory results. Diagnoses-based components were subclassified considering the healthcare setting (primary, secondary, inpatient care). The Unified Medical Language System was used for semantic harmonization within data domains. Individual components were extracted and proportion of population identified was compared across data sources. Drug-based components performed similarly in RLDs and PCDs, unlike diagnoses-based components. Using components as building blocks, logical combinations with AND, OR, AND NOT were tested and local experts recommended their preferred data source-tailored combination. The population identified per data sources by resulting algorithms varied from 3.5% to 15.7%, however, age-specific results were fairly comparable. The impact of individual components was assessed: diagnoses-based components identified the majority of cases in PCDs (93-100%), while drug-based components were the main contributors in RLDs (81-100%). The proposed data derivation procedure allowed the generation of data source-tailored case-finding algorithms in a standardized fashion, facilitated transparent documentation of the process and benchmarking of data sources, and provided bases for interpretation of possible inter-data source inconsistency of findings in future studies.",PloS one,2016,"Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Europe; Female; Humans; Male",False,1
Estonian Biobank,27654910,Genomic analyses inform on migration events during the peopling of Eurasia.,"High-coverage whole-genome sequence studies have so far focused on a limited number of geographically restricted populations, or been targeted at specific diseases, such as cancer. Nevertheless, the availability of high-resolution genomic data has led to the development of new methodologies for inferring population history and refuelled the debate on the mutation rate in humans. Here we present the Estonian Biocentre Human Genome Diversity Panel (EGDP), a dataset of 483 high-coverage human genomes from 148 populations worldwide, including 379 new genomes from 125 populations, which we group into diversity and selection sets. We analyse this dataset to refine estimates of continent-wide patterns of heterozygosity, long- and short-distance gene flow, archaic admixture, and changes in effective population size through time as well as for signals of positive or balancing selection. We find a genetic signature in present-day Papuans that suggests that at least 2% of their genome originates from an early and largely extinct expansion of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) out of Africa. Together with evidence from the western Asian fossil record, and admixture between AMHs and Neanderthals predating the main Eurasian expansion, our results contribute to the mounting evidence for the presence of AMHs out of Africa earlier than 75,000 years ago.",Nature,2016,"Animals; Humans; Africa; Asia; Datasets as Topic; Estonia; Europe; Fossils; Gene Flow; Genetics, Population; Genome, Human; Genomics; Heterozygote; History, Ancient; Human Migration; Neanderthals; New Guinea; Population Dynamics; Racial Groups",False,9
Estonian Biobank,26362575,Meta-analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies for Extraversion: Findings from the Genetics of Personality Consortium.,"Extraversion is a relatively stable and heritable personality trait associated with numerous psychosocial, lifestyle and health outcomes. Despite its substantial heritability, no genetic variants have been detected in previous genome-wide association (GWA) studies, which may be due to relatively small sample sizes of those studies. Here, we report on a large meta-analysis of GWA studies for extraversion in 63,030 subjects in 29 cohorts. Extraversion item data from multiple personality inventories were harmonized across inventories and cohorts. No genome-wide significant associations were found at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level but there was one significant hit at the gene level for a long non-coding RNA site (LOC101928162). Genome-wide complex trait analysis in two large cohorts showed that the additive variance explained by common SNPs was not significantly different from zero, but polygenic risk scores, weighted using linkage information, significantly predicted extraversion scores in an independent cohort. These results show that extraversion is a highly polygenic personality trait, with an architecture possibly different from other complex human traits, including other personality traits. Future studies are required to further determine which genetic variants, by what modes of gene action, constitute the heritable nature of extraversion.",Behavior genetics,2016,"Cohort Studies; Extraversion, Psychological; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Multifactorial Inheritance; Personality; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors",False,8

Phenotyping of 137 unrelated deletion and reciprocal duplication carriers of the distal 16p11.2 220 kb BP2-BP3 interval showed that these rearrangements are associated with autism spectrum disorders and mirror phenotypes of obesity/underweight and macrocephaly/microcephaly. Such phenotypes were previously associated with rearrangements of the non-overlapping proximal 16p11.2 600 kb BP4-BP5 interval. These two CNV-prone regions at 16p11.2 are reciprocally engaged in complex chromatin looping, as successfully confirmed by 4C-seq, fluorescence in situ hybridization and Hi-C, as well as coordinated expression and regulation of encompassed genes. We observed that genes differentially expressed in 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 CNV carriers are concomitantly modified in their chromatin interactions, suggesting that disruption of chromatin interplays could participate in the observed phenotypes. We also identified cis- and trans-acting chromatin contacts to other genomic regions previously associated with analogous phenotypes. For example, we uncovered that individuals with reciprocal rearrangements of the trans-contacted 2p15 locus similarly display mirror phenotypes on head circumference and weight.

Estonian Biobank,27494945,Metabolic profiling of alcohol consumption in 9778 young adults.,"High alcohol consumption is a major cause of morbidity, yet alcohol is associated with both favourable and adverse effects on cardiometabolic risk markers. We aimed to characterize the associations of usual alcohol consumption with a comprehensive systemic metabolite profile in young adults. Cross-sectional associations of alcohol intake with 86 metabolic measures were assessed for 9778 individuals from three population-based cohorts from Finland (age 24-45 years, 52% women). Metabolic changes associated with change in alcohol intake during 6-year follow-up were further examined for 1466 individuals. Alcohol intake was assessed by questionnaires. Circulating lipids, fatty acids and metabolites were quantified by high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics and biochemical assays. Increased alcohol intake was associated with cardiometabolic risk markers across multiple metabolic pathways, including higher lipid concentrations in HDL subclasses and smaller LDL particle size, increased proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids and decreased proportion of omega-6 fatty acids, lower concentrations of glutamine and citrate (P < 0.001 for 56 metabolic measures). Many metabolic biomarkers displayed U-shaped associations with alcohol consumption. Results were coherent for men and women, consistent across the three cohorts and similar if adjusting for body mass index, smoking and physical activity. The metabolic changes accompanying change in alcohol intake during follow-up resembled the cross-sectional association pattern (R Alcohol consumption is associated with a complex metabolic signature, including aberrations in multiple biomarkers for elevated cardiometabolic risk.

Platelets are common targets for primary and secondary prevention of several conditions. They are monitored clinically by complete blood counts, specifically with measurements of platelet count (PLT) and mean platelet volume (MPV). Identifying genetic effects on PLT and MPV can provide mechanistic insights into platelet biology and their role in disease. Therefore, we formed the Blood Cell Consortium (BCX) to perform a large-scale meta-analysis of Exomechip association results for PLT and MPV in 157,293 and 57,617 individuals, respectively. Using the low-frequency/rare coding variant-enriched Exomechip genotyping array, we sought to identify genetic variants associated with PLT and MPV. In addition to confirming 47 known PLT and 20 known MPV associations, we identified 32 PLT and 18 MPV associations not previously observed in the literature across the allele frequency spectrum, including rare large effect (FCER1A), low-frequency (IQGAP2, MAP1A, LY75), and common (ZMIZ2, SMG6, PEAR1, ARFGAP3/PACSIN2) variants. Several variants associated with PLT/MPV (PEAR1, MRVI1, PTGES3) were also associated with platelet reactivity. In concurrent BCX analyses, there was overlap of platelet-associated variants with red (MAP1A, TMPRSS6, ZMIZ2) and white (PEAR1, ZMIZ2, LY75) blood cell traits, suggesting common regulatory pathways with shared genetic architecture among these hematopoietic lineages.

Estonian Biobank,27346689,Large-Scale Exome-wide Association Analysis Identifies Loci for White Blood Cell Traits and Pleiotropy with Immune-Mediated Diseases.,"White blood cells play diverse roles in innate and adaptive immunity. Genetic association analyses of phenotypic variation in circulating white blood cell (WBC) counts from large samples of otherwise healthy individuals can provide insights into genes and biologic pathways involved in production, differentiation, or clearance of particular WBC lineages (myeloid, lymphoid) and also potentially inform the genetic basis of autoimmune, allergic, and blood diseases. We performed an exome array-based meta-analysis of total WBC and subtype counts (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils) in a multi-ancestry discovery and replication sample of ∼157,622 individuals from 25 studies. We identified 16 common variants (8 of which were coding variants) associated with one or more WBC traits, the majority of which are pleiotropically associated with autoimmune diseases. Based on functional annotation, these loci included genes encoding surface markers of myeloid, lymphoid, or hematopoietic stem cell differentiation (CD69, CD33, CD87), transcription factors regulating lineage specification during hematopoiesis (ASXL1, IRF8, IKZF1, JMJD1C, ETS2-PSMG1), and molecules involved in neutrophil clearance/apoptosis (C10orf54, LTA), adhesion (TNXB), or centrosome and microtubule structure/function (KIF9, TUBD1). Together with recent reports of somatic ASXL1 mutations among individuals with idiopathic cytopenias or clonal hematopoiesis of undetermined significance, the identification of a common regulatory 3' UTR variant of ASXL1 suggests that both germline and somatic ASXL1 mutations contribute to lower blood counts in otherwise asymptomatic individuals.

To characterize the effects of the 16p11.2 duplication on cognitive, behavioral, medical, and anthropometric traits and to understand the specificity of these effects by systematically comparing results in duplication carriers and reciprocal deletion carriers, who are also at risk for ASD. This international cohort study of 1006 study participants compared 270 duplication carriers with their 102 intrafamilial control individuals, 390 reciprocal deletion carriers, and 244 deletion controls from European and North American cohorts. Data were collected from August 1, 2010, to May 31, 2015 and analyzed from January 1 to August 14, 2015. Linear mixed models were used to estimate the effect of the duplication and deletion on clinical traits by comparison with noncarrier relatives. Findings on the Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ), Nonverbal IQ, and Verbal IQ; the presence of ASD or other DSM-IV diagnoses; BMI; head circumference; and medical data. Among the 1006 study participants, the duplication was associated with a mean FSIQ score that was lower by 26.3 points between proband carriers and noncarrier relatives and a lower mean FSIQ score (16.2-11.4 points) in nonproband carriers. The mean overall effect of the deletion was similar (-22.1 points; P < .001). However, broad variation in FSIQ was found, with a 19.4- and 2.0-fold increase in the proportion of FSIQ scores that were very low (≤40) and higher than the mean (>100) compared with the deletion group (P < .001). Parental FSIQ predicted part of this variation (approximately 36.0% in hereditary probands). Although the frequency of ASD was similar in deletion and duplication proband carriers (16.0% and 20.0%, respectively), the FSIQ was significantly lower (by 26.3 points) in the duplication probands with ASD. There also were lower head circumference and BMI measurements among duplication carriers, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies. The mean effect of the duplication on cognition is similar to that of the reciprocal deletion, but the variance in the duplication is significantly higher, with severe and mild subgroups not observed with the deletion.

However, information about intra- vs. interspecific variation among the genes commonly used in diversity surveys is limited. Here, the nuclear small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene portions were sequenced from 3 to 5 individual spores from each of two isolates of Rhizophagus irregularis and Gigaspora margarita.

Average intraspecific sequence similarity values were 99%, 96% and 94% for amplicons in SSU, LSU and ITS, respectively. The suitability of the central part of the SSU as a marker for AM fungal community surveys was further supported by its level of nucleotide variation, which is similar to that of the ITS region; its alignability across the entire phylum; its appropriate length for next-generation sequencing; and its ease of amplification in single-step PCR.",Molecular ecology,2016,"DNA, Fungal; DNA, Ribosomal Spacer; Genetic Variation; Glomeromycota; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Mycorrhizae; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Ribosome Subunits, Large; Ribosome Subunits, Small; Sequence Analysis, DNA",False,2

However, precise biomarker phenotypes may afford greater statistical power and identify novel variants. Here we report the results of a GWAS meta-analysis of levels of cotinine, the primary metabolite of nicotine, in 4,548 daily smokers of European ancestry. We identified a locus close to UGT2B10 at 4q13.2 (minimum p = 5.89 × 10(-10) for rs114612145), which was consequently replicated. This variant is in high linkage disequilibrium with a known functional variant in the UGT2B10 gene which is associated with reduced nicotine and cotinine glucuronidation activity, but intriguingly is not associated with nicotine intake. Additionally, we observed association between multiple variants within the 15q25.1 region and cotinine levels, all located within the CHRNA5-A3-B4 gene cluster or adjacent genes, consistent with previous much larger GWAS using self-report measures of smoking quantity. These results clearly illustrate the increase in power afforded by using precise biomarker measures in GWAS.

Estonian Biobank,27605587,Characterization of the metabolic profile associated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D: a cross-sectional analysis in population-based data.,"Numerous observational studies have observed associations between vitamin D deficiency and cardiometabolic diseases, but these findings might be confounded by obesity. A characterization of the metabolic profile associated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels, in general and stratified by abdominal obesity, may help to untangle the relationship between vitamin D, obesity and cardiometabolic health. Serum metabolomics measurements were obtained from a nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)- and a mass spectrometry (MS)-based platform. The discovery was conducted in 1726 participants of the population-based KORA-F4 study, in which the associations of the concentrations of 415 metabolites with 25(OH)D levels were assessed in linear models. The results were replicated in 6759 participants (NMR) and 609 (MS) participants, respectively, of the population-based FINRISK 1997 study. Mean [standard deviation (SD)] 25(OH)D levels were 15.2 (7.5) ng/ml in KORA F4 and 13.8 (5.9) ng/ml in FINRISK 1997; 37 metabolites were associated with 25(OH)D in KORA F4 at P < 0.05/415. Of these, 30 associations were replicated in FINRISK 1997 at P < 0.05/37. Among these were constituents of (very) large very-low-density lipoprotein and small low-density lipoprotein subclasses and related measures like serum triglycerides as well as fatty acids and measures reflecting the degree of fatty acid saturation. The observed associations were independent of waist circumference and generally similar in abdominally obese and non-obese participants. Independently of abdominal obesity, higher 25(OH)D levels were associated with a metabolite profile characterized by lower concentrations of atherogenic lipids and a higher degree of fatty acid polyunsaturation.

TAB-Methyl-SEQ data were extensively validated by a set of five methodologically different protocols. Importantly, these extensive cross-comparisons revealed that protocols based on Tet1-assisted bisulfite conversion provided more precise hmC values than TrueMethyl-based methods. A total of 109 454 CpG sites were analyzed by TAB-Methyl-SEQ for mC and hmC in 188 genes from 20 different adult human livers. We describe three types of variability of hepatic hmC profiles: (i) sample-specific variability at 40.8% of CpG sites analyzed, where the local hmC values correlate to the global hmC content of livers (measured by LC-MS), (ii) gene-specific variability, where hmC levels in the coding regions positively correlate to expression of the respective gene and (iii) site-specific variability, where prominent hmC peaks span only 1 to 3 neighboring CpG sites. Our data suggest that both the gene- and site-specific components of hmC variability might contribute to the epigenetic control of hepatic genes.

Estonian Biobank,27731410,No Association of Coronary Artery Disease with X-Chromosomal Variants in Comprehensive International Meta-Analysis.,"In recent years, genome-wide association studies have identified 58 independent risk loci for coronary artery disease (CAD) on the autosome. However, due to the sex-specific data structure of the X chromosome, it has been excluded from most of these analyses. While females have 2 copies of chromosome X, males have only one. Also, one of the female X chromosomes may be inactivated. Therefore, special test statistics and quality control procedures are required. Thus, little is known about the role of X-chromosomal variants in CAD. To fill this gap, we conducted a comprehensive X-chromosome-wide meta-analysis including more than 43,000 CAD cases and 58,000 controls from 35 international study cohorts. For quality control, sex-specific filters were used to adequately take the special structure of X-chromosomal data into account. For single study analyses, several logistic regression models were calculated allowing for inactivation of one female X-chromosome, adjusting for sex and investigating interactions between sex and genetic variants. Then, meta-analyses including all 35 studies were conducted using random effects models. None of the investigated models revealed genome-wide significant associations for any variant. Although we analyzed the largest-to-date sample, currently available methods were not able to detect any associations of X-chromosomal variants with CAD.",Scientific reports,2016,"Chromosomes, Human, X; Cohort Studies; Coronary Artery Disease; Female; Humans; Internationality; Male",False,7
Estonian Biobank,27004446,Imprinted genes and imprinting control regions show predominant intermediate methylation in adult somatic tissues.,"Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic feature characterized by parent-specific monoallelic gene expression. The aim of this study was to compare the DNA methylation status of imprinted genes and imprinting control regions (ICRs), harboring differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in a comprehensive panel of 18 somatic tissues. The germline DMRs analyzed were divided into ubiquitously imprinted and placenta-specific DMRs, which show identical and different methylation imprints in adult somatic and placental tissues, respectively. We showed that imprinted genes and ICR DMRs maintain methylation patterns characterized by intermediate methylation levels in somatic tissues, which are pronounced in a specific region of the promoter area, located 200-1500 bp from the transcription start site. This intermediate methylation is concordant with gene expression from a single unmethylated allele and silencing of a reciprocal parental allele through DNA methylation. The only exceptions were seen for ICR DMRs of placenta-specific imprinted genes, which showed low levels of methylation, suggesting that these genes escape parent-specific epigenetic regulation in somatic tissues.",Epigenomics,2016,"Adult; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Female; Gene Expression; Genomic Imprinting; Germ Cells; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Specificity; Placenta; Pregnancy; Promoter Regions, Genetic",False,0

The rapidly increasing prevalence of myopia poses a major public health challenge. Here, the CREAM consortium performs a joint meta-analysis to test single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) main effects and SNP × education interaction effects on refractive error in 40,036 adults from 25 studies of European ancestry and 10,315 adults from 9 studies of Asian ancestry. In European ancestry individuals, we identify six novel loci (FAM150B-ACP1, LINC00340, FBN1, DIS3L-MAP2K1, ARID2-SNAT1 and SLC14A2) associated with refractive error. In Asian populations, three genome-wide significant loci AREG, GABRR1 and PDE10A also exhibit strong interactions with education (P<8.5 × 10(-5)), whereas the interactions are less evident in Europeans.

Here, we developed a statistical framework to test the association between gene KOs and quantitative human traits. Our method is flexible, publicly available, and compatible with common genotype format files (e.g. PLINK and vcf). We characterized gene KOs in 4498 participants from the NHLBI Exome Sequence Project (ESP) sequenced at high coverage (>100×), 1976 French Canadians from the Montreal Heart Institute Biobank sequenced at low coverage (5.7×), and >100 000 participants from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium genotyped on an exome array. We tested associations between gene KOs and three anthropometric traits: body mass index (BMI), height and BMI-adjusted waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Despite our large sample size and multiple datasets available, we could not detect robust associations between specific gene KOs and quantitative anthropometric traits. Our results highlight several limitations and challenges for future gene KO studies in humans, in particular when there is no prior knowledge on the phenotypes that might be affected by the tested gene KOs. They also suggest that gene KOs identified with current DNA sequencing methodologies probably do not strongly influence normal variation in BMI, height, and WHR in the general human population.",Human molecular genetics,2016,"Anthropometry; Body Height; Body Mass Index; Canada; Exome; Female; Gene Knockout Techniques; Genotype; Humans; Male; Mutation; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Waist-Hip Ratio",False,7
Estonian Biobank,28049566,An Analysis of Two Genome-wide Association Meta-analyses Identifies a New Locus for Broad Depression Phenotype.,"The genetics of depression has been explored in genome-wide association studies that focused on either major depressive disorder or depressive symptoms with mostly negative findings. A broad depression phenotype including both phenotypes has not been tested previously using a genome-wide association approach. We aimed to identify genetic polymorphisms significantly associated with a broad phenotype from depressive symptoms to major depressive disorder. We analyzed two prior studies of 70,017 participants of European ancestry from general and clinical populations in the discovery stage. We performed a replication meta-analysis of 28,328 participants. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability and genetic correlations were calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression. Discovery and replication analyses were performed using a p-value-based meta-analysis. Lifetime major depressive disorder and depressive symptom scores were used as the outcome measures. The SNP-based heritability of major depressive disorder was 0.21 (SE = 0.02), the SNP-based heritability of depressive symptoms was 0.04 (SE = 0.01), and their genetic correlation was 1.001 (SE = 0.2). We found one genome-wide significant locus related to the broad depression phenotype (rs9825823, chromosome 3: 61,082,153, p = 8.2 × 10 This large study identified a new locus for depression.

Twelve loci reached genome-wide significance (P<5 × 10(-8)), of which eight were previously associated with increased overall adiposity (BMI, BF%) and four (in or near COBLL1/GRB14, IGF2BP1, PLA2G6, CRTC1) were novel associations with BF%. Seven loci showed a larger effect on BF% than on BMI, suggestive of a primary association with adiposity, while five loci showed larger effects on BMI than on BF%, suggesting association with both fat and lean mass. In particular, the loci more strongly associated with BF% showed distinct cross-phenotype association signatures with a range of cardiometabolic traits revealing new insights in the link between adiposity and disease risk.",Nature communications,2016,Adiposity; Animals; Drosophila melanogaster; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Heart Diseases; Humans; Quantitative Trait Loci,False,7
Estonian Biobank,26965542,Metabolomic Profiling of Statin Use and Genetic Inhibition of HMG-CoA Reductase.,"Statins are first-line therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention, but their systemic effects across lipoprotein subclasses, fatty acids, and circulating metabolites remain incompletely characterized. This study sought to determine the molecular effects of statin therapy on multiple metabolic pathways. Metabolic profiles based on serum nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics were quantified at 2 time points in 4 population-based cohorts from the United Kingdom and Finland (N = 5,590; 2.5 to 23.0 years of follow-up). Concentration changes in 80 lipid and metabolite measures during follow-up were compared between 716 individuals who started statin therapy and 4,874 persistent nonusers. To further understand the pharmacological effects of statins, we used Mendelian randomization to assess associations of a genetic variant known to mimic inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (the intended drug target) with the same lipids and metabolites for 27,914 individuals from 8 population-based cohorts. Starting statin therapy was associated with numerous lipoprotein and fatty acid changes, including substantial lowering of remnant cholesterol (80% relative to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]), but only modest lowering of triglycerides (25% relative to LDL-C). Among fatty acids, omega-6 levels decreased the most (68% relative to LDL-C); other fatty acids were only modestly affected. No robust changes were observed for circulating amino acids, ketones, or glycolysis-related metabolites. The intricate metabolic changes associated with statin use closely matched the association pattern with rs12916 in the HMGCR gene (R(2) = 0.94, slope 1.00 ± 0.03). Statin use leads to extensive lipid changes beyond LDL-C and appears efficacious for lowering remnant cholesterol. Metabolomic profiling, however, suggested minimal effects on amino acids.

Estonian Biobank,27329260,Genomewide meta-analysis identifies loci associated with IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels with impact on age-related traits.,"The growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis can be manipulated in animal models to promote longevity, and IGF-related proteins including IGF-I and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) have also been implicated in risk of human diseases including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Through genomewide association study of up to 30 884 adults of European ancestry from 21 studies, we confirmed and extended the list of previously identified loci associated with circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations (IGF1, IGFBP3, GCKR, TNS3, GHSR, FOXO3, ASXL2, NUBP2/IGFALS, SORCS2, and CELSR2). Significant sex interactions, which were characterized by different genotype-phenotype associations between men and women, were found only for associations of IGFBP-3 concentrations with SNPs at the loci IGFBP3 and SORCS2. Analyses of SNPs, gene expression, and protein levels suggested that interplay between IGFBP3 and genes within the NUBP2 locus (IGFALS and HAGH) may affect circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations. The IGF-I-decreasing allele of SNP rs934073, which is an eQTL of ASXL2, was associated with lower adiposity and higher likelihood of survival beyond 90 years. The known longevity-associated variant rs2153960 (FOXO3) was observed to be a genomewide significant SNP for IGF-I concentrations. Bioinformatics analysis suggested enrichment of putative regulatory elements among these IGF-I- and IGFBP-3-associated loci, particularly of rs646776 at CELSR2. In conclusion, this study identified several loci associated with circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations and provides clues to the potential role of the IGF axis in mediating effects of known (FOXO3) and novel (ASXL2) longevity-associated loci.",Aging cell,2016,"Adult; Aging; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Male; Metabolome; Quantitative Trait Loci; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid",False,7

Estonian Biobank,27346685,Exome Genotyping Identifies Pleiotropic Variants Associated with Red Blood Cell Traits.,"Red blood cell (RBC) traits are important heritable clinical biomarkers and modifiers of disease severity. To identify coding genetic variants associated with these traits, we conducted meta-analyses of seven RBC phenotypes in 130,273 multi-ethnic individuals from studies genotyped on an exome array. After conditional analyses and replication in 27,480 independent individuals, we identified 16 new RBC variants. We found low-frequency missense variants in MAP1A (rs55707100, minor allele frequency [MAF] = 3.3%, p = 2 × 10(-10) for hemoglobin [HGB]) and HNF4A (rs1800961, MAF = 2.4%, p < 3 × 10(-8) for hematocrit [HCT] and HGB). In African Americans, we identified a nonsense variant in CD36 associated with higher RBC distribution width (rs3211938, MAF = 8.7%, p = 7 × 10(-11)) and showed that it is associated with lower CD36 expression and strong allelic imbalance in ex vivo differentiated human erythroblasts. We also identified a rare missense variant in ALAS2 (rs201062903, MAF = 0.2%) associated with lower mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (p < 8 × 10(-9)). Mendelian mutations in ALAS2 are a cause of sideroblastic anemia and erythropoietic protoporphyria. Gene-based testing highlighted three rare missense variants in PKLR, a gene mutated in Mendelian non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia, associated with HGB and HCT (SKAT p < 8 × 10(-7)). These rare, low-frequency, and common RBC variants showed pleiotropy, being also associated with platelet, white blood cell, and lipid traits.

Estonian Biobank,27461515,Whole-genome expression analysis reveals genes associated with treatment response to escitalopram in major depression.,"The reasons for variability in treatment response in major depressive disorder (MDD) are not fully understood, but there is accumulating evidence suggesting that therapeutic outcomes of antidepressants can be influenced by genetic factors. In the present study we applied the microarray Illumina platform for whole genome expression profiling in depressive patients treated with escitalopram medication in order to identify genes underlying response to antidepressant treatment. The initial study sample consisted of 135 outpatients with major depressive disorder (mean age 31.1±11.6 years, 68% females) treated with escitalopram 10-20mg/day for 12 weeks, from which 87 patients (55 females) were included in gene expression analyzing. The gene expression profiles were measured on peripheral blood cells at baseline, at week 4 and at the end of treatment (week 12) using BeadChips Illumina. The fold change was used to demonstrate rate of changes in average gene expressions between studied groups. Statistical analyses were performed using the false discovery rate (FDR). The most interesting gene, which showed the predictive effect on treatment outcome by delineating low dose responders and treatment-resistant patients at the beginning of medication, was NLGN2, belonging to a family of neuronal cell surface proteins and involving in synapse formation. In addition, the several gene clusters, related to immune response, signal transduction and neurotrophin pathway, have distinguished responders from non-responders at the week 4 of treatment. After 4 weeks of escitalopram treatment (10mg/day), the YWHAZ gene has showed the highest transcriptional change in responders as compared with non-responders. Finally, at the end of the treatment we noticed that at least three genes (NR2C2, ZNF641, FKBP1A) have been strongly associated with resistance to escitalopram.

We hypothesized that a GWAS of an integrated assessment of fasting and dynamic measures of insulin sensitivity would detect novel common variants. We performed a GWAS of the modified Stumvoll Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI) within the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-Related Traits Consortium. Discovery for genetic association was performed in 16,753 individuals, and replication was attempted for the 23 most significant novel loci in 13,354 independent individuals. Association with ISI was tested in models adjusted for age, sex, and BMI and in a model analyzing the combined influence of the genotype effect adjusted for BMI and the interaction effect between the genotype and BMI on ISI (model 3).

We developed an approach that calculates averaged PCs (AvPCs) representing body shape derived from six anthropometric traits (body mass index, height, weight, waist and hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio). The first four AvPCs explain >99% of the variability, are heritable, and associate with cardiometabolic outcomes. We performed genome-wide association analyses for each body shape composite phenotype across 65 studies and meta-analysed summary statistics. We identify six novel loci: LEMD2 and CD47 for AvPC1, RPS6KA5/C14orf159 and GANAB for AvPC3, and ARL15 and ANP32 for AvPC4.

Males are seven times more likely than females to develop a hernia and have a 27 % lifetime 'risk' of inguinal hernia repair. Several studies have demonstrated that a positive family history is an important risk factor for the development of primary inguinal hernia, which indicates that genetic factors may play important roles in the etiology of the disease. So far, the contribution of genetic factors and underlying mechanisms for inguinal hernia remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate a multiplex Estonian family with inguinal hernia across four generations. The whole-exome sequencing was carried out in three affected family members and subsequent mutation screening using Sanger sequencing was performed in ten family members (six affected and four unaffected). Whole-exome sequencing in three affected family members revealed a heterozygous missense mutation c.88880A>C (p.Lys29627Thr; RefSeq NM_001256850.1) in the highly conserved myosin-binding A-band of the TTN gene.

The region may also harbour common inversion polymorphisms whose functional and phenotypic manifestations are unknown. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, we detected four large contiguous haplotype-genotypes at 15q24 with Mendelian inheritance in 2,562 trios, African origin, high population stratification and reduced recombination rates. Although the haplotype-genotypes have been most likely generated by decreased or absent recombination among them, we could not confirm that they were the product of inversion polymorphisms in the region. One of the blocks was composed of three haplotype-genotypes (N1a, N1b and N2), which significantly correlated with intelligence quotient (IQ) in 2,735 children of European ancestry from three independent population cohorts. Homozygosity for N2 was associated with lower verbal IQ (2.4-point loss, p-value = 0.01), while homozygosity for N1b was associated with 3.2-point loss in non-verbal IQ (p-value = 0.0006). The three alleles strongly correlated with expression levels of MAN2C1 and SNUPN in blood and brain. Homozygosity for N2 correlated with over-expression of MAN2C1 over many brain areas but the occipital cortex where N1b homozygous highly under-expressed.

Most GWAS loci represent clusters of common, noncoding variants from which pinpointing causal genes remains challenging. Here we combined data from 718,734 individuals to discover rare and low-frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5%) coding variants associated with BMI. We identified 14 coding variants in 13 genes, of which 8 variants were in genes (ZBTB7B, ACHE, RAPGEF3, RAB21, ZFHX3, ENTPD6, ZFR2 and ZNF169) newly implicated in human obesity, 2 variants were in genes (MC4R and KSR2) previously observed to be mutated in extreme obesity and 2 variants were in GIPR. The effect sizes of rare variants are ~10 times larger than those of common variants, with the largest effect observed in carriers of an MC4R mutation introducing a stop codon (p.Tyr35Ter, MAF = 0.01%), who weighed ~7 kg more than non-carriers.

However, heterogeneity in allelic effects between GWAS at these loci can occur that is correlated with ancestry. Here, a novel approach is presented to detect SNP association and quantify the extent of heterogeneity in allelic effects that is correlated with ancestry. We employ trans-ethnic meta-regression to model allelic effects as a function of axes of genetic variation, derived from a matrix of mean pairwise allele frequency differences between GWAS, and implemented in the MR-MEGA software. Through detailed simulations, we demonstrate increased power to detect association for MR-MEGA over fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis across a range of scenarios of heterogeneity in allelic effects between ethnic groups. We also demonstrate improved fine-mapping resolution, in loci containing a single causal variant, compared to these meta-analysis approaches and PAINTOR, and equivalent performance to MANTRA at reduced computational cost. Application of MR-MEGA to trans-ethnic GWAS of kidney function in 71,461 individuals indicates stronger signals of association than fixed-effects meta-analysis when heterogeneity in allelic effects is correlated with ancestry.

Yet, their intakes remain remarkably variable both within and across populations, which could partly owe to genetic influences. To identify common genetic variants that influence fish and dietary eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA) consumption. We conducted genome-wide association (GWA) meta-analysis of fish (n = 86,467) and EPA+DHA (n = 62,265) consumption in 17 cohorts of European descent from the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) Consortium Nutrition Working Group. Results from cohort-specific GWA analyses (additive model) for fish and EPA+DHA consumption were adjusted for age, sex, energy intake, and population stratification, and meta-analyzed separately using fixed-effect meta-analysis with inverse variance weights (METAL software). Additionally, heritability was estimated in 2 cohorts. Heritability estimates for fish and EPA+DHA consumption ranged from 0.13-0.24 and 0.12-0.22, respectively. A significant GWA for fish intake was observed for rs9502823 on chromosome 6: each copy of the minor allele (FreqA = 0.015) was associated with 0.029 servings/day (~1 serving/month) lower fish consumption (P = 1.96x10-8). No significant association was observed for EPA+DHA, although rs7206790 in the obesity-associated FTO gene was among top hits (P = 8.18x10-7). Post-hoc calculations demonstrated 95% statistical power to detect a genetic variant associated with effect size of 0.05% for fish and 0.08% for EPA+DHA. These novel findings suggest that non-genetic personal and environmental factors are principal determinants of the remarkable variation in fish consumption, representing modifiable targets for increasing intakes among all individuals.

In functional follow-up studies, rare height-increasing alleles of STC2 (giving an increase of 1-2 centimetres per allele) compromised proteolytic inhibition of PAPP-A and increased cleavage of IGFBP-4 in vitro, resulting in higher bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors. These 83 height-associated variants overlap genes that are mutated in monogenic growth disorders and highlight new biological candidates (such as ADAMTS3, IL11RA and NOX4) and pathways (such as proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis) involved in growth.

Pharmacogenetic research has identified a multitude of gene-drug response associations, which have resulted in genetically guided treatment and dosing decisions to yield a higher success rate of pharmacological treatment. The rapid technological developments for genetic analyses reveal that the number of genetic variants with importance for drug action is much higher than previously thought and that a true personalized prediction of drug response requires attention to millions of rare mutations.

Estonian Biobank,28724413,Smoking-related general and cause-specific mortality in Estonia.,"Tobacco smoking is known to be the single largest cause of premature death worldwide. The aim of present study was to analyse the effect of smoking on general and cause-specific mortality in the Estonian population. The data from 51,756 adults in the Estonian Genome Center of the University of Tartu was used. Information on dates and causes of death was retrieved from the National Causes of Death Registry. Smoking status, general survival, general mortality and cause-specific mortality were analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards models. The study found that smoking reduces median survival in men by 11.4 years and in women by 5.8 years. Tobacco smoking produces a very specific pattern in the cause of deaths, significantly increasing the risks for different cancers and cardiovascular diseases as causes of death for men and women. This study also identified that external causes, such as alcohol intoxication and intentional self-harm, are more prevalent causes of death among smokers than non-smokers. Additionally, smoking cessation was found to reverse the increased risks for premature mortality. Tobacco smoking remains the major cause for losses of life inducing cancers and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the common diseases, external causes also reduce substantially the years of life. External causes of death indicate that smoking has a long-term influence on the behaviour of smokers, provoking self-destructive behaviour. Our study supports the idea, that tobacco smoking generates complex harm to our health increasing mortality from both somatic and mental disorders.",BMC public health,2017,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alcoholic Intoxication; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cause of Death; Estonia; Female; Humans; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality, Premature; Neoplasms; Prevalence; Proportional Hazards Models; Self-Injurious Behavior; Sex Factors; Smoking; Young Adult",False,4

Here, using genome-wide association meta-analysis of 606,059 parents' survival, we discover two regions associated with longevity (HLA-DQA1/DRB1 and LPA). We also validate previous suggestions that APOE, CHRNA3/5, CDKN2A/B, SH2B3 and FOXO3A influence longevity. Next we show that giving up smoking, educational attainment, openness to new experience and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are most positively genetically correlated with lifespan while susceptibility to coronary artery disease (CAD), cigarettes smoked per day, lung cancer, insulin resistance and body fat are most negatively correlated. We suggest that the effect of education on lifespan is principally mediated through smoking while the effect of obesity appears to act via CAD. Using instrumental variables, we suggest that an increase of one body mass index unit reduces lifespan by 7 months while 1 year of education adds 11 months to expected lifespan.Variability in human longevity is genetically influenced.

Here, we studied the relationship between CRP and gene expression levels in the blood in 491 individuals from the Estonian Biobank cohort, to elucidate the role of CRP in these inflammatory mechanisms. As a result, we identified a set of 1,614 genes associated with changes in CRP levels with a high proportion of interferon-stimulated genes. Further, we performed likelihood-based causality model selection and Mendelian randomization analysis to discover causal links between CRP and the expression of CRP-associated genes. Strikingly, our computational analysis and cell culture stimulation assays revealed increased CRP levels to drive the expression of complement regulatory protein CD59, suggesting CRP to have a critical role in protecting blood cells from the adverse effects of the immune defence system.

The current single-center retrospective study was undertaken to analyze short- and long-term all-cause mortality after operative treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm and to examine the factors that influence outcome. The data of all abdominal aortic aneurysm patients treated with open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair in 2004-2015 were retrospectively retrieved from the clinical database of Tartu University Hospital. The primary endpoint was 30-day, 90-day, and 5-year all-cause mortality. The secondary endpoint was determination of the risk factors for mortality. Elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was performed on 228 patients (mean age 71.8 years), of whom 178 (78%) were treated with open repair and 50 (22%) with endovascular aneurysm repair. A total of 48 patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm were treated with open repair (mean age 73.8 years) at the Department of Vascular Surgery, Tartu University Hospital, Estonia. Mean follow-up period was 4.2 ± 3.3 years. In patients with elective abdominal aortic aneurysm, 30-day, 90-day, and 5-year all-cause mortality rates were 0.9%, 2.6%, and 32%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the main predictors for 5-year mortality were preoperative creatinine value and age (p < 0.05). In patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, 30-day, 90-day, and 5-year all-cause mortality rates were 22.9%, 33.3%, and 55.1%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the risk factors for 30-day mortality in ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm were perioperative hemoglobin and lactate levels (p < 0.05). According to this study, the all-cause mortality rates of elective abdominal aortic aneurysm and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at our hospital were comparable to those at other centers worldwide. Even though some variables were identified as potential predictors of survival, the mortality rates after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm remain high.

Estonian Biobank,28942743,Genetic risk scores and family history as predictors of schizophrenia in Nordic registers.,"Family history is a long-standing and readily obtainable risk factor for schizophrenia (SCZ). Low-cost genotyping technologies have enabled large genetic studies of SCZ, and the results suggest the utility of genetic risk scores (GRS, direct assessments of inherited common variant risk). Few studies have evaluated family history and GRS simultaneously to ask whether one can explain away the other. We studied 5959 SCZ cases and 8717 controls from four Nordic countries. All subjects had family history data from national registers and genome-wide genotypes that were processed through the quality control procedures used by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Using external training data, GRS were estimated for SCZ, bipolar disorder (BIP), major depression, autism, educational attainment, and body mass index. Multivariable modeling was used to estimate effect sizes. Using harmonized genomic and national register data from Denmark, Estonia, Norway, and Sweden, we confirmed that family history of SCZ and GRS for SCZ and BIP were risk factors for SCZ. In a joint model, the effects of GRS for SCZ and BIP were essentially unchanged, and the effect of family history was attenuated but remained significant. The predictive capacity of a model including GRS and family history neared the minimum for clinical utility. Combining national register data with measured genetic risk factors represents an important investigative approach for psychotic disorders.

Estonian Biobank,28892072,Neuregulin signaling pathway in smoking behavior.,"Understanding molecular processes that link comorbid traits such as addictions and mental disorders can provide novel therapeutic targets. Neuregulin signaling pathway (NSP) has previously been implicated in schizophrenia, a neurodevelopmental disorder with high comorbidity to smoking. Using a Finnish twin family sample, we have previously detected association between nicotine dependence and ERBB4 (a neuregulin receptor), and linkage for smoking initiation at the ERBB4 locus on 2q33. Further, Neuregulin3 has recently been shown to associate with nicotine withdrawal in a behavioral mouse model. In this study, we scrutinized association and linkage between 15 036 common, low frequency and rare genetic variants in 10 NSP genes and phenotypes encompassing smoking and alcohol use. Using the Finnish twin family sample (N=1998 from 740 families), we detected 66 variants (representing 23 LD blocks) significantly associated (false discovery rate P<0.05) with smoking initiation, nicotine dependence and nicotine withdrawal. We comprehensively annotated the associated variants using expression (eQTL) and methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) analyses in a Finnish population sample. Among the 66 variants, we identified 25 eQTLs (in NRG1 and ERBB4), 22 meQTLs (in NRG3, ERBB4 and PSENEN), a missense variant in NRG1 (rs113317778) and a splicing disruption variant in ERBB4 (rs13385826). Majority of the QTLs in blood were replicated in silico using publicly available databases, with additional QTLs observed in brain.

This sampling strategy focuses on the population structure present in Finland before the 1950s. By using the recent haplotype-based methods ChromoPainter (CP) and FineSTRUCTURE (FS) we reveal a highly geographically clustered genetic structure in Finland and report its connections to the settlement history as well as to the current dialectal regions of the Finnish language. The main genetic division within Finland shows striking concordance with the 1323 borderline of the treaty of Nöteborg. In general, we detect genetic substructure throughout the country, which reflects stronger regional genetic differences in Finland compared to, for example, the UK, which in a similar analysis was dominated by a single unstructured population. We expect that similar population genetic reference data sets will become available for many more populations in the near future with important applications, for example, in forensic genetics and in genetic association studies.

To identify factors that affect hematopoiesis, we performed association studies for blood cell traits in the population-based Estonian Biobank using high-coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in 2,284 samples and SNP genotyping in an additional 14,904 samples. Using up to 7,134 samples with available phenotype data, our analyses identified 17 associations across 14 blood cell traits. Integration of WGS-based fine-mapping and complementary epigenomic datasets provided evidence for causal mechanisms at several loci, including at a previously undiscovered basophil count-associated locus near the master hematopoietic transcription factor CEBPA The fine-mapped variant at this basophil count association near CEBPA overlapped an enhancer active in common myeloid progenitors and influenced its activity. In situ perturbation of this enhancer by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells demonstrated that it is necessary for and specifically regulates CEBPA expression during basophil differentiation. We additionally identified basophil count-associated variation at another more pleiotropic myeloid enhancer near GATA2, highlighting regulatory mechanisms for ordered expression of master hematopoietic regulators during lineage specification.

By varying the number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their respective weights, alternative versions of GRS can be computed. They were tested in 1,181 T2D cases and 9,092 controls of the Estonian Biobank cohort. The best-fitting GRS was chosen for the subsequent analysis of incident T2D (386 cases). The best fit was provided by a novel doubly weighted GRS that captures the effect of 1,000 SNPs. The hazard for incident T2D was 3.45 times (95% CI: 2.31-5.17) higher in the highest GRS quintile compared with the lowest quintile, after adjusting for body mass index and other known predictors. Adding GRS to the prediction model for 5-year T2D risk resulted in continuous net reclassification improvement of 0.324 (95% CI: 0.211-0.444). In addition, a significant effect of the GRS on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was observed. The proposed GRS would improve the accuracy of T2D risk prediction when added to the currently used set of predictors.Genet Med 19 3, 322-329.",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2017,"Alleles; Body Mass Index; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Testing; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Precision Medicine; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors",False,0
Estonian Biobank,28537275,A rare-variant test for high-dimensional data.,"Genome-wide association studies have facilitated the discovery of thousands of loci for hundreds of phenotypes. However, the issue of missing heritability remains unsolved for most complex traits. Locus discovery could be enhanced with both improved power through multi-phenotype analysis (MPA) and use of a wider allele frequency range, including rare variants (RVs). MPA methods for single-variant association have been proposed, but given their low power for RVs, more efficient approaches are required. We propose multi-phenotype analysis of rare variants (MARV), a burden test-based method for RVs extended to the joint analysis of multiple phenotypes through a powerful reverse regression technique. Specifically, MARV models the proportion of RVs at which minor alleles are carried by individuals within a genomic region as a linear combination of multiple phenotypes, which can be both binary and continuous, and the method accommodates directly the genotyped and imputed data. The full model, including all phenotypes, is tested for association for discovery, and a more thorough dissection of the phenotype combinations for any set of RVs is also enabled.

Estonian Biobank,28077070,SCOPA and META-SCOPA: software for the analysis and aggregation of genome-wide association studies of multiple correlated phenotypes.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been successful in identifying loci contributing genetic effects to a wide range of complex human diseases and quantitative traits. The traditional approach to GWAS analysis is to consider each phenotype separately, despite the fact that many diseases and quantitative traits are correlated with each other, and often measured in the same sample of individuals. Multivariate analyses of correlated phenotypes have been demonstrated, by simulation, to increase power to detect association with SNPs, and thus may enable improved detection of novel loci contributing to diseases and quantitative traits. We have developed the SCOPA software to enable GWAS analysis of multiple correlated phenotypes. The software implements ""reverse regression"" methodology, which treats the genotype of an individual at a SNP as the outcome and the phenotypes as predictors in a general linear model. SCOPA can be applied to quantitative traits and categorical phenotypes, and can accommodate imputed genotypes under a dosage model. The accompanying META-SCOPA software enables meta-analysis of association summary statistics from SCOPA across GWAS. Application of SCOPA to two GWAS of high-and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and body mass index, and subsequent meta-analysis with META-SCOPA, highlighted stronger association signals than univariate phenotype analysis at established lipid and obesity loci. The META-SCOPA meta-analysis also revealed a novel signal of association at genome-wide significance for triglycerides mapping to GPC5 (lead SNP rs71427535, p = 1.1x10 The SCOPA and META-SCOPA software enable discovery and dissection of multiple phenotype association signals through implementation of a powerful reverse regression approach.",BMC bioinformatics,2017,"Body Mass Index; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Obesity; Phenotype; Software; Triglycerides",False,6

In this study, the effect on early events (1 h treatment) in transfection by PepFect14 (PF14), with or without oligonucleotide cargo on gene expression, in HeLa cells, have been investigated. The RNA expression profile was characterized by RNA sequencing and confirmed by qPCR analysis. The gene regulations were then related to the biological processes by the study of signaling pathways that showed the induction of autophagy-related genes in early transfection. A ligand library interfering with the detected intracellular pathways showed concentration-dependent effects on the transfection efficiency of splice correction oligonucleotide complexed with PepFect14, proving that the autophagy process is induced upon the uptake of complexes. Finally, the autophagy induction and colocalization with autophagosomes have been confirmed by confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. We conclude that autophagy, an inherent cellular response process, is triggered by the cellular uptake of CPP-based transfection system.

We examined the interplay between genetic risk of obesity, restrained eating and changes in body weight and size. Participants were Finnish aged 25-74 years who attended the DIetary, Lifestyle and Genetic determinants of Obesity and Metabolic syndrome study at baseline in 2007 and follow-up in 2014. At baseline (n=5024), height, weight and waist circumference (WC) were measured in a health examination and participants self-reported their weight at age 20 years. At follow-up (n=3735), height, weight and WC were based on measured or self-reported information. We calculated 7-year change in body mass index (BMI) and WC and annual weight change from age 20 years to baseline. Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R18 was used to assess restrained eating. Genetic risk of obesity was assessed by calculating a polygenic risk score of 97 known BMI-related loci. Cross-lagged autoregressive models indicated that baseline restrained eating was unrelated to 7-year change in BMI (β=0.00; 95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.01, 0.02). Instead, higher baseline BMI predicted greater 7-year increases in restrained eating (β=0.08; 95% CI=0.05, 0.11). Similar results were obtained with WC. Polygenic risk score correlated positively with restrained eating and obesity indicators in both study phases, but it did not predict 7-year change in BMI or WC. However, individuals with higher genetic risk of obesity tended to gain more weight from age 20 years to baseline, and this association was more pronounced in unrestrained eaters than in restrained eaters (P=0.038 for interaction). Our results suggest that restrained eating is a marker for previous weight gain rather than a factor that leads to future weight gain in middle-aged adults. Genetic influences on weight gain from early to middle adulthood may vary according to restrained eating, but this finding needs to be replicated in future studies.",International journal of obesity (2005),2018,"Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Diet, Reducing; Female; Finland; Follow-Up Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Prospective Studies; Risk; Surveys and Questionnaires",False,5

Methods Participants were recruited from the population-based Norwegian HUNT Study. Thirty-six female headache patients who transformed from episodic to chronic headache between baseline and follow-up 11 years later were matched against 35 controls with episodic headache. DNA methylation was quantified at 485,000 CpG sites, and changes in methylation level at these sites were compared between cases and controls by linear regression analysis. Data were analyzed in two stages (Stages 1 and 2) and in a combined meta-analysis. Results None of the top 20 CpG sites identified in Stage 1 replicated in Stage 2 after multiple testing correction. In the combined meta-analysis the strongest associated CpG sites were related to SH2D5 and NPTX2, two brain-expressed genes involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Functional enrichment analysis pointed to processes including calcium ion binding and estrogen receptor pathways.

We detected two major signalling pathways (ion channels and the ERBB signalling family of tyrosine kinases) that could be replicated across independent GWA studies meta-analyses. To investigate the significance of these pathways for sleep modulation, we performed transcriptome analyses of short sleeping flies' heads (knockdown for the ABCC9 gene homolog; dSur). We found significant alterations in gene-expression in the short sleeping knockdowns versus controls flies, which correspond to pathways associated with sleep duration in our human studies. Most notably, the expression of Rho and EGFR (members of the ERBB signalling pathway) genes was down- and up-regulated, respectively, consistently with the established role of these genes for sleep consolidation in Drosophila. Using a disease multifactorial interaction network, we showed that many of the genes of the pathways indicated to be relevant for sleep duration had functional evidence of their involvement with sleep regulation, circadian rhythms, insulin secretion, gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis.",Scientific reports,2017,"Animals; Computational Biology; Drosophila; ErbB Receptors; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Humans; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Signal Transduction; Sleep; Transcriptome",False,7

Most studies use single marker linear regression to discover primary signals, followed by sequential conditional modeling to detect secondary genetic variants affecting gene expression.

The effector function of immunoglobulin G (IgG) alters between pro- and anti-inflammatory, based on its glycosylation. IgG glycan synthesis is highly complex and dynamic. With the use of two different analytical methods for assessing IgG glycosylation, we aim to elucidate the link between DNA methylation and glycosylation of IgG by means of epigenome-wide association studies. In total, 3000 individuals from 4 cohorts were analyzed. The overlap of the results from the two glycan measurement panels yielded DNA methylation of 7 CpG-sites on 5 genomic locations to be associated with IgG glycosylation: cg25189904 (chr.1, GNG12); cg05951221, cg21566642 and cg01940273 (chr.2, ALPPL2); cg05575921 (chr.5, AHRR); cg06126421 (6p21.33); and cg03636183 (chr.19, F2RL3). Mediation analyses with respect to smoking revealed that the effect of smoking on IgG glycosylation may be at least partially mediated via DNA methylation levels at these 7 CpG-sites. Our results suggest the presence of an indirect link between DNA methylation and IgG glycosylation that may in part capture environmental exposures. An epigenome-wide analysis conducted in four population-based cohorts revealed an association between DNA methylation and IgG glycosylation patterns.

Estonian Biobank,28209135,MARV: a tool for genome-wide multi-phenotype analysis of rare variants.,"Genome-wide association studies have enabled identification of thousands of loci for hundreds of traits. Yet, for most human traits a substantial part of the estimated heritability is unexplained. This and recent advances in technology to produce high-dimensional data cost-effectively have led to method development beyond standard common variant analysis, including single-phenotype rare variant and multi-phenotype common variant analysis, with the latter increasing power for locus discovery and providing suggestions of pleiotropic effects. However, there are currently no optimal methods and tools for the combined analysis of rare variants and multiple phenotypes. We propose a user-friendly software tool MARV for Multi-phenotype Analysis of Rare Variants. The tool is based on a method that collapses rare variants within a genomic region and models the proportion of minor alleles in the rare variants on a linear combination of multiple phenotypes. MARV provides analyses of all phenotype combinations within one run and calculates the Bayesian Information Criterion to facilitate model selection. The running time increases with the size of the genetic data while the number of phenotypes to analyse has little effect both on running time and required memory. We illustrate the use of MARV with analysis of triglycerides (TG), fasting insulin (FI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) in 4,721 individuals from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. The analysis suggests novel multi-phenotype effects for these metabolic traits at APOA5 and ZNF259, and at ZNF259 provides stronger support for association (P  MARV is a computationally efficient, flexible and user-friendly software tool allowing rapid identification of rare variant effects on multiple phenotypes, thus paving the way for novel discoveries and insights into biology of complex traits.",BMC bioinformatics,2017,Computational Biology; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Phenotype; Software,False,2

Although there is a widespread perception that environmental influences on the epigenome are pervasive and profound, there has been little evidence to date in humans with respect to environmental factors that are biologically distal. Here we provide evidence on the associations between epigenetic modifications-in our case, CpG methylation-and educational attainment (EA), a biologically distal environmental factor that is arguably among the most important life-shaping experiences for individuals. Specifically, we report the results of an epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis of EA based on data from 27 cohort studies with a total of 10 767 individuals. We find nine CpG probes significantly associated with EA. However, robustness analyses show that all nine probes have previously been found to be associated with smoking. Only two associations remain when we perform a sensitivity analysis in the subset of never-smokers, and these two probes are known to be strongly associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy, and thus their association with EA could be due to correlation between EA and maternal smoking. Moreover, the effect sizes of the associations with EA are far smaller than the known associations with the biologically proximal environmental factors alcohol consumption, body mass index, smoking and maternal smoking during pregnancy. Follow-up analyses that combine the effects of many probes also point to small methylation associations with EA that are highly correlated with the combined effects of smoking. If our findings regarding EA can be generalized to other biologically distal environmental factors, then they cast doubt on the hypothesis that such factors have large effects on the epigenome.",Molecular psychiatry,2017,"Academic Success; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Genetic Association Studies; Humans; Multifactorial Inheritance",False,7

The genetic architecture of human NTDs, including spina bifida and hydrocephalus, is highly heterogeneous, with multiple genes/loci and both gene-gene and gene-environment interactions involved. Hence, the variation in outcomes also most likely relates to a combination of the severity of different variants in multiple genes and genetic modifiers affecting the biochemical traits. Here, we present a multiple-spouse family with one pedigree lineage where three brothers are affected with NTDs-two lumbar spina bifidas without hydrocephalus and one obstructive hydrocephalus. We sequenced the exomes of three NTD patients and their parents.

MiR-34a expression is often downregulated in cancer cells and its restoration has been shown to exert a tumor-suppressive effect. However, effective and safe delivery of synthetic miRNA analogs into cancer cells remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to evaluate cell-penetrating peptide PepFect (PF)14 as a carrier for delivery of miR-34a-5p into human primary prostate carcinoma-1 (PPC-1) cells. Using microarray expression analysis, we identified a total of 3,283 (1,744 upregulated and 1,539 downregulated) differentially expressed genes in PF14:miR-34a-5p-transfected cells. In comparison, miR-34a-5p delivery with the commercially available lipid-based reagent siPORT-NeoFX (siPORT) had less robust effects on differential expression and affected fewer genes significantly (90 upregulated and 91 downregulated genes). Functional annotation revealed significant enrichment for downregulated genes in processes and pathways associated with the cell cycle and proliferation regulation in PF14:miR-34a-5p-transfected cells. Five genes (ARHGAP1, AXL, CDC25A, FOSL1, and PDGFRA) were identified and validated as relevant quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-based markers of miR-34a-5p transfection efficiency. Our experiments revealed novel potential miR-34a-5p targets and demonstrate that PF14 is a reliable transfection reagent for miRNA mimics characterized by high efficiency and low toxicity relative to lipid-based reagents.",Nucleic acid therapeutics,2017,A549 Cells; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Cell-Penetrating Peptides; Down-Regulation; Drug Carriers; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Lipopeptides; MicroRNAs; Transfection,False,3
Estonian Biobank,27240531,"Chromosomal contacts connect loci associated with autism, BMI and head circumference phenotypes.","Copy number variants (CNVs) are major contributors to genomic imbalance disorders. Phenotyping of 137 unrelated deletion and reciprocal duplication carriers of the distal 16p11.2 220 kb BP2-BP3 interval showed that these rearrangements are associated with autism spectrum disorders and mirror phenotypes of obesity/underweight and macrocephaly/microcephaly. Such phenotypes were previously associated with rearrangements of the non-overlapping proximal 16p11.2 600 kb BP4-BP5 interval. These two CNV-prone regions at 16p11.2 are reciprocally engaged in complex chromatin looping, as successfully confirmed by 4C-seq, fluorescence in situ hybridization and Hi-C, as well as coordinated expression and regulation of encompassed genes. We observed that genes differentially expressed in 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 CNV carriers are concomitantly modified in their chromatin interactions, suggesting that disruption of chromatin interplays could participate in the observed phenotypes. We also identified cis- and trans-acting chromatin contacts to other genomic regions previously associated with analogous phenotypes. For example, we uncovered that individuals with reciprocal rearrangements of the trans-contacted 2p15 locus similarly display mirror phenotypes on head circumference and weight. Our results indicate that chromosomal contacts' maps could uncover functionally and clinically related genes.",Molecular psychiatry,2017,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Body Mass Index; Child; Child, Preschool; Chromatin; Chromosome Deletion; Chromosome Duplication; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16; DNA Copy Number Variations; Female; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Infant; Intellectual Disability; Male; Megalencephaly; Microcephaly; Middle Aged; Obesity; Phenotype",False,4

Here, we estimate the proportion of co-expression that is due to shared genetic variance. To do so, we estimated the genetic correlations between each pairwise combination of 2469 transcripts that are highly heritable and expressed in whole blood in 1748 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. We identify 556 pairs with a significant genetic correlation of which 77% are located on different chromosomes, and report 934 expression quantitative trait loci, identified in an independent cohort, with significant effects on both transcripts in a genetically correlated pair. We show significant enrichment for transcription factor control and physical proximity through chromatin interactions as possible mechanisms of shared genetic control. Finally, we construct networks of interconnected transcripts and identify their underlying biological functions. Using genetic correlations to investigate transcriptional co-regulation provides valuable insight into the nature of the underlying genetic architecture of gene regulation.Covariance of gene expression pairs is due to a combination of shared genetic and environmental factors.

Predisposition to preeclampsia is in part heritable. It is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. We have sequenced 124 candidate genes implicated in preeclampsia to pinpoint genetic variants contributing to predisposition to or protection from preeclampsia. First, targeted exomic sequencing was performed in 500 preeclamptic women and 190 controls from the FINNPEC cohort (Finnish Genetics of Preeclampsia Consortium). Then 122 women with a history of preeclampsia and 1905 parous women with no such history from the National FINRISK Study (a large Finnish population survey on risk factors of chronic, noncommunicable diseases) were included in the analyses.

Estonian Biobank,28614350,Ranking and characterization of established BMI and lipid associated loci as candidates for gene-environment interactions.,"Phenotypic variance heterogeneity across genotypes at a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may reflect underlying gene-environment (G×E) or gene-gene interactions. We modeled variance heterogeneity for blood lipids and BMI in up to 44,211 participants and investigated relationships between variance effects (Pv), G×E interaction effects (with smoking and physical activity), and marginal genetic effects (Pm). Correlations between Pv and Pm were stronger for SNPs with established marginal effects (Spearman's ρ = 0.401 for triglycerides, and ρ = 0.236 for BMI) compared to all SNPs. When Pv and Pm were compared for all pruned SNPs, only BMI was statistically significant (Spearman's ρ = 0.010). Overall, SNPs with established marginal effects were overrepresented in the nominally significant part of the Pv distribution (Pbinomial <0.05). SNPs from the top 1% of the Pm distribution for BMI had more significant Pv values (PMann-Whitney = 1.46×10-5), and the odds ratio of SNPs with nominally significant (<0.05) Pm and Pv was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.57) for BMI. Moreover, BMI SNPs with nominally significant G×E interaction P-values (Pint<0.05) were enriched with nominally significant Pv values (Pbinomial = 8.63×10-9 and 8.52×10-7 for SNP × smoking and SNP × physical activity, respectively).

Estonian Biobank,28792954,Variants in calcium voltage-gated channel subunit Alpha1 C-gene (CACNA1C) are associated with sleep latency in infants.,"Genetic variants in CACNA1C (calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 C) are associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia where sleep disturbances are common. In an experimental model, Cacna1c has been found to modulate the electrophysiological architecture of sleep. There are strong genetic influences for consolidation of sleep in infancy, but only a few studies have thus far researched the genetic factors underlying the process. We hypothesized that genetic variants in CACNA1C affect the regulation of sleep in early development. Seven variants that were earlier associated (genome-wide significantly) with psychiatric disorders at CACNA1C were selected for analyses. The study sample consists of 1086 infants (520 girls and 566 boys) from the Finnish CHILD-SLEEP birth cohort (genotyped by Illumina Infinium PsychArray BeadChip). Sleep length, latency, and nightly awakenings were reported by the parents of the infants with a home-delivered questionnaire at 8 months of age. The genetic influence of CACNA1C variants on sleep in infants was examined by using PLINK software. Three of the examined CACNA1C variants, rs4765913, rs4765914, and rs2239063, were associated with sleep latency (permuted P<0.05). There was no significant association between studied variants and night awakenings or sleep duration. CACNA1C variants for psychiatric disorders were found to be associated with long sleep latency among 8-month-old infants.

Endometrium has its characteristic DNA methylation profile, although not much is known about the endometrial methylome changes throughout the menstrual cycle. The impact of methylome changes on gene expression and thereby on the function of the tissue, including establishing receptivity to implanting embryo, is also unclear. Therefore, this study used genome-wide technologies to characterize the methylome and the correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression in endometrial biopsies collected from 17 healthy fertile-aged women from pre-receptive and receptive phase within one menstrual cycle. Our study showed that the overall methylome remains relatively stable during this stage of the menstrual cycle, with small-scale changes affecting 5% of the studied CpG sites (22,272 out of studied 437,022 CpGs, FDR < 0.05). Of differentially methylated CpG sites with the largest absolute changes in methylation level, approximately 30% correlated with gene expression measured by RNA sequencing, with negative correlations being more common in 5' UTR and positive correlations in the gene 'Body' region.

Estonian Biobank,28209224,Systematic Evaluation of Pleiotropy Identifies 6 Further Loci Associated With Coronary Artery Disease.,"Genome-wide association studies have so far identified 56 loci associated with risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Many CAD loci show pleiotropy; that is, they are also associated with other diseases or traits. This study sought to systematically test if genetic variants identified for non-CAD diseases/traits also associate with CAD and to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the extent of pleiotropy of all CAD loci. In discovery analyses involving 42,335 CAD cases and 78,240 control subjects we tested the association of 29,383 common (minor allele frequency >5%) single nucleotide polymorphisms available on the exome array, which included a substantial proportion of known or suspected single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with common diseases or traits as of 2011. Suggestive association signals were replicated in an additional 30,533 cases and 42,530 control subjects. To evaluate pleiotropy, we tested CAD loci for association with cardiovascular risk factors (lipid traits, blood pressure phenotypes, body mass index, diabetes, and smoking behavior), as well as with other diseases/traits through interrogation of currently available genome-wide association study catalogs. We identified 6 new loci associated with CAD at genome-wide significance: on 2q37 (KCNJ13-GIGYF2), 6p21 (C2), 11p15 (MRVI1-CTR9), 12q13 (LRP1), 12q24 (SCARB1), and 16q13 (CETP). Risk allele frequencies ranged from 0.15 to 0.86, and odds ratio per copy of the risk allele ranged from 1.04 to 1.09. Of 62 new and known CAD loci, 24 (38.7%) showed statistical association with a traditional cardiovascular risk factor, with some showing multiple associations, and 29 (47%) showed associations at p < 1 × 10 We identified 6 loci associated with CAD at genome-wide significance.

Here, we perform a comprehensive investigation using 3,059 newly generated low-depth whole-genome sequences from eight European isolates and two matched general populations, together with published data from the 1000 Genomes Project and UK10K. Sequencing data give deeper and richer insights into population demography and genetic characteristics than genotype-chip data, distinguishing related populations more effectively and allowing their functional variants to be studied more fully. We demonstrate relaxation of purifying selection in the isolates, leading to enrichment of rare and low-frequency functional variants, using novel statistics, DVxy and SVxy. We also develop an isolation-index (Isx) that predicts the overall level of such key genetic characteristics and can thus help guide population choice in future complex-trait association studies.",Nature communications,2017,"Gene Frequency; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome, Human; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; White People; Whole Genome Sequencing",False,9

In this study, we sought to identify common and rare psoriasis-associated gene-centric variation. Using exome arrays we genotyped four independent cohorts, totalling 11 861 psoriasis cases and 28 610 controls, aggregating the dataset through statistical meta-analysis. Single variant analysis detected a previously unreported risk locus at TNFSF15 (rs6478108; P = 1.50 × 10-8, OR = 1.10), and association of common protein-altering variants at 11 loci previously implicated in psoriasis susceptibility. We validate previous reports of protective low-frequency protein-altering variants within IFIH1 (encoding an innate antiviral receptor) and TYK2 (encoding a Janus kinase), in each case establishing a further series of protective rare variants (minor allele frequency < 0.01) via gene-wide aggregation testing (IFIH1: pburden = 2.53 × 10-7, OR = 0.707; TYK2: pburden = 6.17 × 10-4, OR = 0.744).

However, the overlap between the studies is relatively small, and we are still searching for potential diagnostic biomarkers. Here we perform a meta-analysis of endometrial-receptivity associated genes on 164 endometrial samples (76 from 'pre-receptive' and 88 from mid-secretory, 'receptive' phase endometria) using a robust rank aggregation (RRA) method, followed by enrichment analysis, and regulatory microRNA prediction. We identify a meta-signature of endometrial receptivity involving 57 mRNA genes as putative receptivity markers, where 39 of these we confirm experimentally using RNA-sequencing method in two separate datasets. The meta-signature genes highlight the importance of immune responses, the complement cascade pathway and the involvement of exosomes in mid-secretory endometrial functions. Bioinformatic prediction identifies 348 microRNAs that could regulate 30 endometrial-receptivity associated genes, and we confirm experimentally the decreased expression of 19 microRNAs with 11 corresponding up-regulated meta-signature genes in our validation experiments.

This required the development and verification of a computerized dose adjustment application, DosOpt, to guide the selection. Model fitting in DosOpt uses Bayesian methods for deriving individual pharmacokinetic (PK) estimates from population priors and patient therapeutic drug monitoring measurements. These are used to simulate concentration-time curves and target-constrained dose optimization. DosOpt was verified by assessing bias and precision through several error metrics and normalized prediction distribution errors on samples simulated from the Anderson et al PK model. The performance of DosOpt was also evaluated using retrospective clinical data. Achieved probabilities of target concentration attainment were benchmarked against corresponding attainments in our clinical retrospective data set. Simulations showed no systemic forecast biases. Normalized prediction distribution error values of the base model were distributed by standardized Gaussian (P = 0.1), showing good model suitability. A retrospective test data set included 149 treatment episodes with 1-10 vancomycin concentration measurements per patient (median 2). Individual concentrations in PK estimation improved probability of target attainment and decreased the variance of the estimation. Including 3 individual concentrations in the kinetics estimation increased the probability of Ctrough attainment within 10-15 mg/L from 16% obtained with no individual data (95% confidence interval, 11%-24%) to 43% (21%-47%). DosOpt uses individual concentration data to estimate kinetics and find optimal doses that increase the probability of achieving desired trough concentrations.

Methylation was measured using Illumina 450 k arrays in 2035 individuals from six cohorts. Hcy-associated differentially methylated positions and regions were identified using meta-analysis. Three differentially methylated positions cg21607669 (SLC27A1), cg26382848 (AJUBA) and cg10701000 (KCNMA1) at chromosome 19, 14 and 10, respectively, were significantly associated with Hcy. In addition, we identified 68 Hcy-associated differentially methylated regions, the most significant of which was a 1.8-kb spanning domain (TNXB/ATF6B) at chromosome 6.

Estonian Biobank,28242760,DNA breaks and chromatin structural changes enhance the transcription of autoimmune regulator target genes.,"The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) protein is the key factor in thymic negative selection of autoreactive T cells by promoting the ectopic expression of tissue-specific genes in the thymic medullary epithelium. Mutations in AIRE cause a monogenic autoimmune disease called autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy. AIRE has been shown to promote DNA breaks via its interaction with topoisomerase 2 (TOP2). In this study, we investigated topoisomerase-induced DNA breaks and chromatin structural alterations in conjunction with AIRE-dependent gene expression. Using RNA sequencing, we found that inhibition of TOP2 religation activity by etoposide in AIRE-expressing cells had a synergistic effect on genes with low expression levels. AIRE-mediated transcription was not only enhanced by TOP2 inhibition but also by the TOP1 inhibitor camptothecin. The transcriptional activation was associated with structural rearrangements in chromatin, notably the accumulation of γH2AX and the exchange of histone H1 with HMGB1 at AIRE target gene promoters. In addition, we found the transcriptional up-regulation to co-occur with the chromatin structural changes within the genomic cluster of carcinoembryonic antigen-like cellular adhesion molecule genes. Overall, our results suggest that the presence of AIRE can trigger molecular events leading to an altered chromatin landscape and the enhanced transcription of low-expressed genes.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2017,"Alternative Splicing; Antigens, Neoplasm; Camptothecin; Carcinoembryonic Antigen; Chromatin; DNA Damage; DNA Topoisomerases, Type II; DNA-Binding Proteins; Etoposide; GPI-Linked Proteins; Gene Expression Profiling; HEK293 Cells; HMGB1 Protein; Histones; Humans; Multigene Family; Mutation; Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Domains; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptional Activation; AIRE Protein",False,7
Estonian Biobank,27115767,Whole-exome sequencing identifies a potential TTN mutation in a multiplex family with inguinal hernia.,"Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common procedures in general surgery. Males are seven times more likely than females to develop a hernia and have a 27 % lifetime 'risk' of inguinal hernia repair. Several studies have demonstrated that a positive family history is an important risk factor for the development of primary inguinal hernia, which indicates that genetic factors may play important roles in the etiology of the disease. So far, the contribution of genetic factors and underlying mechanisms for inguinal hernia remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate a multiplex Estonian family with inguinal hernia across four generations. The whole-exome sequencing was carried out in three affected family members and subsequent mutation screening using Sanger sequencing was performed in ten family members (six affected and four unaffected). Whole-exome sequencing in three affected family members revealed a heterozygous missense mutation c.88880A>C (p.Lys29627Thr; RefSeq NM_001256850.1) in the highly conserved myosin-binding A-band of the TTN gene. Sanger sequencing demonstrated that this mutation cosegregated with the disease in this family and was not present in ethnically matched control subjects.

The goal of this study was to investigate how the inhibitors of these pathways improve the efficiency of hESC differentiation when compared with basic BMP4 treatment. RNA sequencing was used to analyse the effects of all possible inhibitor combinations on the differentiation of hESC into trophoblast-like cells over 12 days. Genes differentially expressed compared with untreated cells were identified at seven time points. Additionally, expression of total human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and its hyperglycosylated form (HCG-H) were determined by immunoassay from cell culture media. We showed that FGF2 inhibition with BMP4 activation up-regulates syncytiotrophoblast-specific genes (CGA, CGB and LGALS16), induces several molecular pathways involved in embryo implantation and triggers HCG-H production. In contrast, inhibition of the TGF-β/activin/nodal pathway decreases the ability of hESC to form trophoblast-like cells. Information about the conditions needed for hESC differentiation toward trophoblast-like cells helps us to find an optimal model for studying the early development of human trophoblasts in normal and in complicated pregnancy.",Reproductive biomedicine online,2017,"Activins; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Down-Regulation; Fibroblast Growth Factor 2; Human Embryonic Stem Cells; Humans; Nodal Protein; Signal Transduction; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Trophoblasts",False,7

Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in ∼450000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N ∼700000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits. We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of P < 1 × 10-8), including 1185 height-associated SNPs and 751 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The near-independent genome-wide significant SNPs explain ∼24.6% of the variance of height and ∼6.0% of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were ∼0.44 and ∼0.22, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization, we identified an enrichment of eQTLs among lead height and BMI signals, prioritizing 610 and 138 genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by the discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex trait biology.

We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations.

Estonian Biobank,30566500,Large-scale genome-wide meta-analysis of polycystic ovary syndrome suggests shared genetic architecture for different diagnosis criteria.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovarian morphology. Affected women frequently have metabolic disturbances including insulin resistance and dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. PCOS is diagnosed with two different sets of diagnostic criteria, resulting in a phenotypic spectrum of PCOS cases. The genetic similarities between cases diagnosed based on the two criteria have been largely unknown. Previous studies in Chinese and European subjects have identified 16 loci associated with risk of PCOS. We report a fixed-effect, inverse-weighted-variance meta-analysis from 10,074 PCOS cases and 103,164 controls of European ancestry and characterisation of PCOS related traits. We identified 3 novel loci (near PLGRKT, ZBTB16 and MAPRE1), and provide replication of 11 previously reported loci. Only one locus differed significantly in its association by diagnostic criteria; otherwise the genetic architecture was similar between PCOS diagnosed by self-report and PCOS diagnosed by NIH or non-NIH Rotterdam criteria across common variants at 13 loci. Identified variants were associated with hyperandrogenism, gonadotropin regulation and testosterone levels in affected women. Linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis revealed genetic correlations with obesity, fasting insulin, type 2 diabetes, lipid levels and coronary artery disease, indicating shared genetic architecture between metabolic traits and PCOS. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested variants associated with body mass index, fasting insulin, menopause timing, depression and male-pattern balding play a causal role in PCOS. The data thus demonstrate 3 novel loci associated with PCOS and similar genetic architecture for all diagnostic criteria. The data also provide the first genetic evidence for a male phenotype for PCOS and a causal link to depression, a previously hypothesized comorbid disease. Thus, the genetics provide a comprehensive view of PCOS that encompasses multiple diagnostic criteria, gender, reproductive potential and mental health.",PLoS genetics,2018,Asian People; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Phenotype; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; White People,False,5

Expression experiments and comprehensive in silico analyses identified retinal cell physiology and light processing as prominent mechanisms, and also identified functional contributions to refractive-error development in all cell types of the neurosensory retina, retinal pigment epithelium, vascular endothelium and extracellular matrix. Newly identified genes implicate novel mechanisms such as rod-and-cone bipolar synaptic neurotransmission, anterior-segment morphology and angiogenesis. Thirty-one loci resided in or near regions transcribing small RNAs, thus suggesting a role for post-transcriptional regulation.

The current single-center retrospective study was undertaken to analyze short- and long-term all-cause mortality after operative treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm and to examine the factors that influence outcome. The data of all abdominal aortic aneurysm patients treated with open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair in 2004-2015 were retrospectively retrieved from the clinical database of Tartu University Hospital. The primary endpoint was 30-day, 90-day, and 5-year all-cause mortality. The secondary endpoint was determination of the risk factors for mortality. Elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was performed on 228 patients (mean age 71.8 years), of whom 178 (78%) were treated with open repair and 50 (22%) with endovascular aneurysm repair. A total of 48 patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm were treated with open repair (mean age 73.8 years) at the Department of Vascular Surgery, Tartu University Hospital, Estonia. Mean follow-up period was 4.2 ± 3.3 years. In patients with elective abdominal aortic aneurysm, 30-day, 90-day, and 5-year all-cause mortality rates were 0.9%, 2.6%, and 32%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the main predictors for 5-year mortality were preoperative creatinine value and age (p < 0.05).

Low-cost genotyping technologies have enabled large genetic studies of SCZ, and the results suggest the utility of genetic risk scores (GRS, direct assessments of inherited common variant risk). Few studies have evaluated family history and GRS simultaneously to ask whether one can explain away the other. We studied 5959 SCZ cases and 8717 controls from four Nordic countries. All subjects had family history data from national registers and genome-wide genotypes that were processed through the quality control procedures used by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Using external training data, GRS were estimated for SCZ, bipolar disorder (BIP), major depression, autism, educational attainment, and body mass index. Multivariable modeling was used to estimate effect sizes. Using harmonized genomic and national register data from Denmark, Estonia, Norway, and Sweden, we confirmed that family history of SCZ and GRS for SCZ and BIP were risk factors for SCZ. In a joint model, the effects of GRS for SCZ and BIP were essentially unchanged, and the effect of family history was attenuated but remained significant. The predictive capacity of a model including GRS and family history neared the minimum for clinical utility. Combining national register data with measured genetic risk factors represents an important investigative approach for psychotic disorders.

We developed and tested algorithms for translation of preexisting genotype data of over 44,000 participants of the Estonian biobank into pharmacogenetic recommendations. We compared the results obtained by genome sequencing, exome sequencing, and genotyping using microarrays, and evaluated the impact of pharmacogenetic reporting based on drug prescription statistics in the Nordic countries and Estonia. Our most striking result was that the performance of genotyping arrays is similar to that of genome sequencing, whereas exome sequencing is not suitable for pharmacogenetic predictions. Interestingly, 99.8% of all assessed individuals had a genotype associated with increased risks to at least one medication, and thereby the implementation of pharmacogenetic recommendations based on genotyping affects at least 50 daily drug doses per 1000 inhabitants. We find that microarrays are a cost-effective solution for creating preemptive pharmacogenetic reports, and with slight modifications, existing databases can be applied for automated pharmacogenetic decision support for clinicians.",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2019,"Algorithms; Biological Specimen Banks; Databases, Factual; Electronic Health Records; Estonia; Genetic Testing; Genotype; Humans; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Pharmacogenetics; Pharmacogenomic Testing; Pharmacogenomic Variants; Phenotype; Precision Medicine; Sequence Analysis, DNA",False,9

Here, we use deep-coverage whole genome sequencing in 8392 individuals of European and African ancestry to discover and interpret both single-nucleotide variants and copy number (CN) variation associated with Lp(a). We observe that genetic determinants between Europeans and Africans have several unique determinants. The common variant rs12740374 associated with Lp(a) cholesterol is an eQTL for SORT1 and independent of LDL cholesterol. Observed associations of aggregates of rare non-coding variants are largely explained by LPA structural variation, namely the LPA kringle IV 2 (KIV2)-CN.

With technological advances, pharmacogenomic research has evolved from candidate gene analyses to genome-wide association studies. Here, we integrate deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) information with drug prescription and ADE data from Estonian electronic health record (EHR) databases to evaluate genome- and pharmacome-wide associations on an unprecedented scale. We leveraged WGS data of 2240 Estonian Biobank participants and imputed all single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) with allele counts over 2 for 13,986 genotyped participants. Overall, we identified 41 (10 novel) loss-of-function and 567 (134 novel) missense variants in 64 very important pharmacogenes. The majority of the detected variants were very rare with frequencies below 0.05%, and 6 of the novel loss-of-function and 99 of the missense variants were only detected as single alleles (allele count = 1). We also validated documented pharmacogenetic associations and detected new independent variants in known gene-drug pairs. Specifically, we found that CTNNA3 was associated with myositis and myopathies among individuals taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory oxicams and replicated this finding in an extended cohort of 706 individuals. These findings illustrate that population-based WGS-coupled EHRs are a useful tool for biomarker discovery.",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2019,"Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Electronic Health Records; Estonia; Humans; Loss of Function Mutation; Mutation Rate; Mutation, Missense; Pharmacogenomic Variants; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; alpha Catenin",False,7

However, there is a need for faster and cheaper laboratory and analysis methods to make NIPT more widely accessible. We have developed a novel software package for detection of fetal aneuploidies from next-generation low-coverage whole genome sequencing data. Our tool - NIPTmer - is based on counting pre-defined per-chromosome sets of unique k-mers from raw sequencing data, and applying linear regression model on the counts. Additionally, the filtering process used for k-mer list creation allows one to take into account the genetic variance in a specific sample, thus reducing the source of uncertainty. The processing time of one sample is less than 10 CPU-minutes on a high-end workstation. NIPTmer was validated on a cohort of 583 NIPT samples and it correctly predicted 37 non-mosaic fetal aneuploidies. NIPTmer has the potential to reduce significantly the time and complexity of NIPT post-sequencing analysis compared to mapping-based methods.

The reports of developing ADRs were predicted from the FFM personality traits after statistically controlling for sociodemographic variables (age, gender and education), baseline indicators of health status (number of diagnoses and medicines taken, body mass index and blood pressure), and the change in health status between the two measurements. The results of a hierarchical binary logistic regression analysis showed that participants who reported the development of ADRs between the two measurements had higher levels of conscientiousness, were more likely to be women, were taking more medicines at baseline and had a higher increase in the number of medicines taken during the study period than participants who did not report any ADRs at either time point (all p values <0.05). Higher neuroticism (p=0.067) and a higher number of diagnosed diseases at baseline (p=0.053) also made marginal contributions to predicting the development of ADRs.

We examined the interplay between genetic risk of obesity, restrained eating and changes in body weight and size. Participants were Finnish aged 25-74 years who attended the DIetary, Lifestyle and Genetic determinants of Obesity and Metabolic syndrome study at baseline in 2007 and follow-up in 2014. At baseline (n=5024), height, weight and waist circumference (WC) were measured in a health examination and participants self-reported their weight at age 20 years. At follow-up (n=3735), height, weight and WC were based on measured or self-reported information. We calculated 7-year change in body mass index (BMI) and WC and annual weight change from age 20 years to baseline. Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R18 was used to assess restrained eating. Genetic risk of obesity was assessed by calculating a polygenic risk score of 97 known BMI-related loci. Cross-lagged autoregressive models indicated that baseline restrained eating was unrelated to 7-year change in BMI (β=0.00; 95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.01, 0.02). Instead, higher baseline BMI predicted greater 7-year increases in restrained eating (β=0.08; 95% CI=0.05, 0.11). Similar results were obtained with WC. Polygenic risk score correlated positively with restrained eating and obesity indicators in both study phases, but it did not predict 7-year change in BMI or WC. However, individuals with higher genetic risk of obesity tended to gain more weight from age 20 years to baseline, and this association was more pronounced in unrestrained eaters than in restrained eaters (P=0.038 for interaction). Our results suggest that restrained eating is a marker for previous weight gain rather than a factor that leads to future weight gain in middle-aged adults.

Although 30% to 60% of their interindividual variability is genetic, common genetic variants explain only 10% to 20% of these differences. Rare genetic variants may be major sources of the missing heritability, yet quantitative evaluations of their contribution to phenotypic variability are lacking. Here, we analyzed whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data from 138,632 individuals across seven major human populations to present a systematic overview of genetic apolipoprotein variability. We provide population-specific frequencies of 38 clinically important apolipoprotein alleles and identify further 6,875 genetic variants, 33% of which are novel and 98.7% of which are rare with minor allele frequencies <1%. We predicted the functional impact of rare variants and found that their relative importance differed drastically between genes and among ethnicities. Importantly, we validated the clinical relevance of multiple variants with predicted effects by leveraging association data from the CARDIoGRAM (Coronary Artery Disease Genomewide Replication and Meta-analysis) and Global Lipids Genetics consortia. Overall, we provide a consolidated overview of population-specific apolipoprotein genetics as a valuable data resource for scientists and clinicians, estimate the importance of rare genetic variants for the missing heritability of apolipoprotein-associated disease traits, and pinpoint multiple novel apolipoprotein variants with putative population-specific impacts on serum lipid levels.",Journal of lipid research,2018,Apolipoproteins; Cardiovascular Diseases; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Haplotypes; Humans,False,2
Estonian Biobank,29706349,Haplotype Sharing Provides Insights into Fine-Scale Population History and Disease in Finland.,"Finland provides unique opportunities to investigate population and medical genomics because of its adoption of unified national electronic health records, detailed historical and birth records, and serial population bottlenecks. We assembled a comprehensive view of recent population history (≤100 generations), the timespan during which most rare-disease-causing alleles arose, by comparing pairwise haplotype sharing from 43,254 Finns to that of 16,060 Swedes, Estonians, Russians, and Hungarians from geographically and linguistically adjacent countries with different population histories. We find much more extensive sharing in Finns, with at least one ≥ 5 cM tract on average between pairs of unrelated individuals. By coupling haplotype sharing with fine-scale birth records from more than 25,000 individuals, we find that although haplotype sharing broadly decays with geographical distance, there are pockets of excess haplotype sharing; individuals from northeast Finland typically share several-fold more of their genome in identity-by-descent segments than individuals from southwest regions. We estimate recent effective population-size changes through time across regions of Finland, and we find that there was more continuous gene flow as Finns migrated from southwest to northeast between the early- and late-settlement regions than was dichotomously described previously. Lastly, we show that haplotype sharing is locally enriched by an order of magnitude among pairs of individuals sharing rare alleles and especially among pairs sharing rare disease-causing variants.

Methods Participants were recruited from the population-based Norwegian HUNT Study. Thirty-six female headache patients who transformed from episodic to chronic headache between baseline and follow-up 11 years later were matched against 35 controls with episodic headache. DNA methylation was quantified at 485,000 CpG sites, and changes in methylation level at these sites were compared between cases and controls by linear regression analysis.

Estonian Biobank,29055820,IgG glycosylation and DNA methylation are interconnected with smoking.,"Glycosylation is one of the most common post-translation modifications with large influences on protein structure and function. The effector function of immunoglobulin G (IgG) alters between pro- and anti-inflammatory, based on its glycosylation. IgG glycan synthesis is highly complex and dynamic. With the use of two different analytical methods for assessing IgG glycosylation, we aim to elucidate the link between DNA methylation and glycosylation of IgG by means of epigenome-wide association studies. In total, 3000 individuals from 4 cohorts were analyzed. The overlap of the results from the two glycan measurement panels yielded DNA methylation of 7 CpG-sites on 5 genomic locations to be associated with IgG glycosylation: cg25189904 (chr.1, GNG12); cg05951221, cg21566642 and cg01940273 (chr.2, ALPPL2); cg05575921 (chr.5, AHRR); cg06126421 (6p21.33); and cg03636183 (chr.19, F2RL3). Mediation analyses with respect to smoking revealed that the effect of smoking on IgG glycosylation may be at least partially mediated via DNA methylation levels at these 7 CpG-sites. Our results suggest the presence of an indirect link between DNA methylation and IgG glycosylation that may in part capture environmental exposures. An epigenome-wide analysis conducted in four population-based cohorts revealed an association between DNA methylation and IgG glycosylation patterns.

Estonian Biobank,30241495,Genes reveal traces of common recent demographic history for most of the Uralic-speaking populations.,"The genetic origins of Uralic speakers from across a vast territory in the temperate zone of North Eurasia have remained elusive. Previous studies have shown contrasting proportions of Eastern and Western Eurasian ancestry in their mitochondrial and Y chromosomal gene pools. While the maternal lineages reflect by and large the geographic background of a given Uralic-speaking population, the frequency of Y chromosomes of Eastern Eurasian origin is distinctively high among European Uralic speakers. The autosomal variation of Uralic speakers, however, has not yet been studied comprehensively. Here, we present a genome-wide analysis of 15 Uralic-speaking populations which cover all main groups of the linguistic family. We show that contemporary Uralic speakers are genetically very similar to their local geographical neighbours. However, when studying relationships among geographically distant populations, we find that most of the Uralic speakers and some of their neighbours share a genetic component of possibly Siberian origin. Additionally, we show that most Uralic speakers share significantly more genomic segments identity-by-descent with each other than with geographically equidistant speakers of other languages. We find that correlated genome-wide genetic and lexical distances among Uralic speakers suggest co-dispersion of genes and languages. Yet, we do not find long-range genetic ties between Estonians and Hungarians with their linguistic sisters that would distinguish them from their non-Uralic-speaking neighbours.

These findings not only confirm the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in the genetic regulation of menstrual cycle length but also highlight potential novel local regulatory mechanisms, such as those mediated by IGF2.",Human molecular genetics,2018,"Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone; Humans; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Insulin-Like Growth Factor II; Menstrual Cycle; Ovary; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Precursors; Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear; Reproduction",False,5
Estonian Biobank,30342241,Transnational access to large prospective cohorts in Europe: Current trends and unmet needs.,"Biobank samples and data from studies of large prospective cohorts (LPC) represent an invaluable resource for health research. Efficient sharing and pooling of samples and data is a central pre-requisite for new advances in biomedical science. This requirement, however, is not compatible with the present scattered and traditional access governance structures, where legal and ethical frameworks often form an obstacle for effective sharing. Moreover, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is demanding increasingly rigorous administration from all those organisations processing personal data. The BBMRI-LPC project (Biobanking and Biomolecular Research Infrastructure - Large Prospective Cohorts) assembled 21 LPCs from 10 countries and two EU-wide multinational cohort networks with a key objective to promote collaborative innovative transnational research proposed by external researchers on the broad field of common chronic diseases, and analyze the gaps and needs involved. BBMRI-LPC organized three scientific calls to offer European investigators an opportunity to gain free of charge transnational access to research material available in the participating cohorts. A total of 11 high-quality research proposals involving multiple prospective cohorts were granted, and the access process in the individual projects carefully monitored. Divergent access governance structures, complex legal and ethical frameworks and heterogeneous procedures were identified as currently constituting substantial obstacles for sample and data transfer in Europe. To optimize the scientific value and use of these research resources, practical solutions for more streamlined access governance in collaborative projects are urgently needed. A number of infrastructure developments could be made to improve time-efficiency in access provision.",New biotechnology,2019,Access to Information; Biological Specimen Banks; Biomedical Research; Europe; Humans; International Cooperation; Prospective Studies,False,1
Estonian Biobank,30295736,Endometrial receptivity revisited: endometrial transcriptome adjusted for tissue cellular heterogeneity.,"Does cellular composition of the endometrial biopsy affect the gene expression profile of endometrial whole-tissue samples? The differences in epithelial and stromal cell proportions in endometrial biopsies modify the whole-tissue gene expression profiles and affect the results of differential expression analyses. Each cell type has its unique gene expression profile. The proportions of epithelial and stromal cells vary in endometrial tissue during the menstrual cycle, along with individual and technical variation due to the method and tools used to obtain the tissue biopsy. Using cell-population specific transcriptome data and computational deconvolution approach, we estimated the epithelial and stromal cell proportions in whole-tissue biopsies taken during early secretory and mid-secretory phases. The estimated cellular proportions were used as covariates in whole-tissue differential gene expression analysis. Endometrial transcriptomes before and after deconvolution were compared and analysed in biological context. Paired early- and mid-secretory endometrial biopsies were obtained from 35 healthy, regularly cycling, fertile volunteers, aged 23-36 years, and analysed by RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using two approaches. In one of them, computational deconvolution was applied as an intermediate step to adjust for the proportions of epithelial and stromal cells in the endometrial biopsy. The results were then compared to conventional differential expression analysis. Ten paired endometrial samples were analysed with qPCR to validate the results. The estimated average proportions of stromal and epithelial cells in early secretory phase were 65% and 35%, and during mid-secretory phase, 46% and 54%, respectively, correlating well with the results of histological evaluation (r = 0.88, P = 1.1 × 10-6). Endometrial tissue transcriptomic analysis showed that approximately 26% of transcripts (n = 946) differentially expressed in receptive endometrium in cell-type unadjusted analysis also remain differentially expressed after adjustment for biopsy cellular composition. However, the other 74% (n = 2645) become statistically non-significant after adjustment for biopsy cellular composition, underlining the impact of tissue heterogeneity on differential expression analysis. The results suggest new mechanisms involved in endometrial maturation, involving genes like LINC01320, SLC8A1 and GGTA1P, described for the first time in context of endometrial receptivity. The RNA-seq data presented in this study is deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database with accession number GSE98386. Only dominant endometrial cell types were considered in gene expression profile deconvolution; however, other less frequent endometrial cell types also contribute to the whole-tissue gene expression profile. The better understanding of molecular processes during transition from pre-receptive to receptive endometrium serves to improve the effectiveness and personalization of assisted reproduction protocols. Biopsy cellular composition should be taken into account in future endometrial 'omics' studies, where tissue heterogeneity could potentially influence the results.

To assess potential differences between metabolic effects of these two lipid-lowering therapies, we performed detailed lipid and metabolite profiling of a large randomized statin trial and compared the results with the effects of genetic inhibition of PCSK9, acting as a naturally occurring trial. 228 circulating metabolic measures were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, including lipoprotein subclass concentrations and their lipid composition, fatty acids, and amino acids, for 5,359 individuals (2,659 on treatment) in the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) trial at 6-months post-randomization. The corresponding metabolic measures were analyzed in eight population cohorts (N=72,185) using  Scaled to an equivalent lowering of LDL-C, the effects of genetic inhibition of PCSK9 on 228 metabolic markers were generally consistent with those of statin therapy ( Genetic inhibition of PCSK9 had similar metabolic effects to statin therapy on detailed lipid and metabolite profiles.

We analyzed quantitative clinical information, exome sequencing, and microarray data from 757 probands and 233 parents and siblings who carry disease-associated variants. The number of rare likely deleterious variants in functionally intolerant genes (""other hits"") correlated with expression of neurodevelopmental phenotypes in probands with 16p12.1 deletion (n=23, p=0.004) and in autism probands carrying gene-disruptive variants (n=184, p=0.03) compared with their carrier family members. Probands with 16p12.1 deletion and a strong family history presented more severe clinical features (p=0.04) and higher burden of other hits compared with those with mild/no family history (p=0.001). The number of other hits also correlated with severity of cognitive impairment in probands carrying pathogenic CNVs (n=53) or de novo pathogenic variants in disease genes (n=290), and negatively correlated with head size among 80 probands with 16p11.2 deletion.

Estonian Biobank,30423443,Diverse phenotype in patients with complex I deficiency due to mutations in NDUFB11.,"Mitochondrial complex I deficiency is the most frequent mitochondrial disorder presenting in childhood and the mutational spectrum is highly heterogeneous. The NDUFB11 gene is one of the recently identified genes, which is located in the short arm of the X-chromosome. Here we report clinical, biochemical, functional and genetic findings of two male patients with lactic acidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and isolated complex I deficiency due to de novo hemizygous mutations (c.286C > T and c.328C > T) in the NDUFB11 gene. Neither of them had any skin manifestations. The NDUFB11 gene encodes a relatively small integral membrane protein NDUFB11, which is essential for the assembly of an active complex I. The expression levels of this protein was decreased in both patient cells and a lentiviral complementation experiment also supported the notion that the complex I deficiency in those two patients is caused by NDUFB11 genetic defects. Our findings together with a review of the thirteen previously described patients demonstrate a wide spectrum of clinical features associated with NDUFB11-related complex I deficiency. However, histiocytoid cardiomyopathy and/or congenital sideroblastic anemia could be indicative for mutation in the NDUFB11 gene, while the clinical manifestation of the same mutation can be highly variable.",European journal of medical genetics,2019,"Adolescent; Anemia, Sideroblastic; Child, Preschool; Electron Transport Complex I; Genetic Diseases, X-Linked; Humans; Male; Mitochondrial Diseases; Mutation; Phenotype",False,7
Estonian Biobank,29581554,Heart rate reduction decreases central blood pressure in sick sinus syndrome patients with a permanent cardiac pacemaker.,"Increased resting heart rate (HR) contributes to higher cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the healthy as well as in people with cardiovascular diseases, possibly due to elevated blood pressure (BP) among other mechanisms. Data on the relationship between HR and central (aortic) BP remains controversial, however, and concerning β-blockers, it has been proposed that pharmacological HR lowering is associated with augmentation of central BP. We aimed to study the role of pharmacologically unaffected HR on central BP indices in sick sinus syndrome patients with a permanent cardiac pacemaker in the HR range from 40 to 90 bpm. We included 27 subjects (mean age 65.8 ± 9.5 years, 12 men) with a dual-chamber pacemaker implanted due to sick sinus syndrome. We determined central hemodynamic indices noninvasively during an atrial pacing mode at low (40 bpm), middle (60 bpm), and high (90 bpm) HR levels with an oscillometric cuff-based device (Sphygmocor XCEL). There was no difference in central systolic BP at the middle versus the high HR level (mean 121.2 ± 13.0 and 121.2 ± 12.1 mmHg, respectively, P = 0.9), but at the low HR level, it was significantly lower than at the middle HR level (mean 117.2 ± 13.1 and 121.2 ± 13.0 mmHg, P < 0.01). Our acute study provides evidence to suggest that at a HR of <60 bpm, sick sinus syndrome patients may have a lower central BP than at a higher HR, despite the proposed augmenting effects of low HR on central BP.",Journal of human hypertension,2018,"Aged; Blood Pressure; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pacemaker, Artificial; Sick Sinus Syndrome",False,0

An age-, sex- and APOE based risk score and family history were used to select cases most likely to harbor novel AD risk variants and controls least likely to develop AD by age 85 years. We tested ~1.5 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 50,000 insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels) for association to AD, using multiple models considering individual variants as well as gene-based tests aggregating rare, predicted functional, and loss of function variants. Sixteen single variants and 19 genes that met criteria for significant or suggestive associations after multiple-testing correction were evaluated for replication in four independent samples; three with whole exome sequencing (2,778 cases, 7,262 controls) and one with genome-wide genotyping imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel (9,343 cases, 11,527 controls). The top findings in the discovery sample were also followed-up in the ADSP whole-genome sequenced family-based dataset (197 members of 42 EA families and 501 members of 157 CH families).

Four cohorts were used for discovery with replication undertaken in the other four to avoid false positives. For metabolites that survived replication, combined association results are presented. Over 246,698 person-years, 995 and 745 cases of incident dementia and Alzheimer's disease were detected, respectively. Three branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine), creatinine and two very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-specific lipoprotein lipid subclasses were associated with lower dementia risk. One high density lipoprotein (HDL; the concentration of cholesterol esters relative to total lipids in large HDL) and one VLDL (total cholesterol to total lipids ratio in very large VLDL) lipoprotein lipid subclass was associated with increased dementia risk. Branched-chain amino acids were also associated with decreased Alzheimer's disease risk and the concentration of cholesterol esters relative to total lipids in large HDL with increased Alzheimer's disease risk.

Most RA patients develop autoantibodies against immunoglobulin G (IgG) and changes in IgG glycosylation have been associated with RA. We undertook this study to determine whether altered IgG glycosylation precedes the disease diagnosis. We studied IgG glycosylation in RA in two prospective cohorts (N = 14,749) by measuring 28 IgG glycan traits in 179 subjects who developed RA within 10-years follow-up and 358 matched controls. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography method based on hydrophilic interactions (HILIC-UPLC) was used to analyse IgG glycans. Future RA diagnosis associated with traits related to lower galactosylation and sialylation of IgG when comparing the cases to the matched controls. In RA cases, these traits did not correlate with the time between being recruited to the study and being diagnosed with RA (median time 4.31 years). The difference in IgG glycosylation was relatively stable and present years before diagnosis. This indicates that long-acting factors affecting IgG glycome composition are among the underlying mechanisms of RA and that decreased galactosylation is a pre-existing risk factor involved in the disease development.",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Estonian Biobank,31043758,Maternal and fetal genetic effects on birth weight and their relevance to cardio-metabolic risk factors.,"Birth weight variation is influenced by fetal and maternal genetic and non-genetic factors, and has been reproducibly associated with future cardio-metabolic health outcomes. In expanded genome-wide association analyses of own birth weight (n = 321,223) and offspring birth weight (n = 230,069 mothers), we identified 190 independent association signals (129 of which are novel). We used structural equation modeling to decompose the contributions of direct fetal and indirect maternal genetic effects, then applied Mendelian randomization to illuminate causal pathways. For example, both indirect maternal and direct fetal genetic effects drive the observational relationship between lower birth weight and higher later blood pressure: maternal blood pressure-raising alleles reduce offspring birth weight, but only direct fetal effects of these alleles, once inherited, increase later offspring blood pressure. Using maternal birth weight-lowering genotypes to proxy for an adverse intrauterine environment provided no evidence that it causally raises offspring blood pressure, indicating that the inverse birth weight-blood pressure association is attributable to genetic effects, and not to intrauterine programming.",Nature genetics,2019,"Adult; Birth Weight; Blood Pressure; Body Height; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Fetal Development; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Heart Diseases; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Inheritance; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Metabolic Diseases; Models, Genetic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Pregnancy; Risk Factors",False,7

To explore the utility of data available in the Biobank, we conducted a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) in two areas of interest to healthcare researchers; asthma and liver disease. We used 11 asthma and 13 liver disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), identified from published genome-wide association studies, to test our ability to detect established associations. We confirmed 2 asthma and 5 liver disease associated variants at nominal significance and directionally consistent with published results. We found 2 associations that were opposite to what was published before (rs4374383:AA increases risk of NASH/NAFLD, rs11597086 increases ALT level). Three SNP-diagnosis pairs passed the phenome-wide significance threshold: rs9273349 and E06 (thyroiditis, p = 5.50x10-8); rs9273349 and E10 (type-1 diabetes, p = 2.60x10-7); and rs2281135 and K76 (non-alcoholic liver diseases, including NAFLD, p = 4.10x10-7). We have validated our approach and confirmed the quality of the data for these conditions.

Here, we recall probands carrying familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)-associated variants, perform cascade screening of family members, and describe health outcomes affected by such a strategy. The Estonian Biobank of Estonian Genome Center, University of Tartu, comprises 52,274 individuals. Among 4776 participants with exome or genome sequences, we identified 27 individuals who carried FH-associated variants in the LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9 genes. Cascade screening of 64 family members identified an additional 20 carriers of FH-associated variants. Via genetic counseling and clinical management of carriers, we were able to reclassify 51% of the study participants from having previously established nonspecific hypercholesterolemia to having FH and identify 32% who were completely unaware of harboring a high-risk disease-associated genetic variant. Imaging-based risk stratification targeted 86% of the variant carriers for statin treatment recommendations.

Seven-year risk estimates were calculated in risk score-specific subsets of the Estonian Biobank cohort. Calibration was assessed by standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and discrimination by Harrell's C-statistics. In addition, a head-to-head comparison of the scores was performed in the intersection of the three score-specific subcohorts. PCE, QRISK2 and SCORE risk estimates were calculated for 4356, 7191 and 3987 eligible individuals, respectively. During the 7-year follow-up, 220 hard ASCVD events (PCE outcome), 671 ASCVD events (QRISK2 outcome) and 94 ASCVD deaths (SCORE outcome) occurred among the score-specific subsets of the cohort. While PCE (SIR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.18) and SCORE (SIR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21) were calibrated well for the cohort, QRISK2 underestimated the risk by 48% (SIR 0.52, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.56). In terms of discrimination, PCE (C-statistic 0.778) was inferior to QRISK2 (C-statistic 0.812) and SCORE (C-statistic 0.865). All three risk scores performed at similar level in the head-to-head comparison. Of three widely used ASCVD risk scores, PCE and SCORE performed at acceptable level, while QRISK2 underestimated ASCVD risk markedly. These results highlight the need for evaluating the accuracy of ASCVD risk scores prior to use in high-risk populations.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2019,Adult; Aged; Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Estonia; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors,False,4

Despite the progress in the field of pharmacogenomics, its implementation into routine care has been slow due to several barriers. However, in recent years, the number of studies on the implementation of PGx has increased, all providing a wealth of knowledge on different solutions for overcoming the obstacles that have been emphasized over the past years.

We compared the results obtained by genome sequencing, exome sequencing, and genotyping using microarrays, and evaluated the impact of pharmacogenetic reporting based on drug prescription statistics in the Nordic countries and Estonia. Our most striking result was that the performance of genotyping arrays is similar to that of genome sequencing, whereas exome sequencing is not suitable for pharmacogenetic predictions. Interestingly, 99.8% of all assessed individuals had a genotype associated with increased risks to at least one medication, and thereby the implementation of pharmacogenetic recommendations based on genotyping affects at least 50 daily drug doses per 1000 inhabitants.

Our paper examines this issue by focusing on the perspective of the professionals working in management or scientific roles in research-based biobanks, who have an important impact on shaping these transformations. In particular, it highlights that recent advances in molecular medicine and genomic research have raised a range of ethical, legal and societal implications (ELSI) related to biobank-based research, impacting directly on regulations and local practices of informed consent (IC), private-public partnerships (PPPs), and engagement of participants. In our study, we investigate the ways that these concerns influence biobanking practices and assess the level of satisfaction of the cross-national biobanking research communities with the ELSI related procedures that are currently in place. We conducted an online survey among biobankers and researchers to investigate secondary use of data, informing and/or re-contacting participants, sharing of data with third parties from industry, participant engagement, and collaboration with industrial partners. Findings highlight the need for a more inclusive and transparent biobanking practice where biobanks are seen in a more active role in providing information and communicating with participants; the need to improve the current IC procedures and the role of biobanks in sharing of samples and data with industry partners and different countries, and the need for practical, tangible and hands-on ethical and legal guidance.",PloS one,2019,Biological Specimen Banks; Biomedical Research; Europe; Humans; Informed Consent; Internet; Surveys and Questionnaires,False,1

We previously identified five loci associated with LM adjusted for fat mass in kilograms. Such an adjustment may reduce the power to identify genetic signals having an association with both lean mass and fat mass. To determine the impact of different fat mass adjustments on genetic architecture of LM and identify additional LM loci. We performed genome-wide association analyses for whole-body LM (20 cohorts of European ancestry with n = 38,292) measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) or bioelectrical impedance analysis, adjusted for sex, age, age2, and height with or without fat mass adjustments (Model 1 no fat adjustment; Model 2 adjustment for fat mass as a percentage of body mass; Model 3 adjustment for fat mass in kilograms). Seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in separate loci, including one novel LM locus (TNRC6B), were successfully replicated in an additional 47,227 individuals from 29 cohorts. Based on the strengths of the associations in Model 1 vs Model 3, we divided the LM loci into those with an effect on both lean mass and fat mass in the same direction and refer to those as ""sumo wrestler"" loci (FTO and MC4R). In contrast, loci with an impact specifically on LM were termed ""body builder"" loci (VCAN and ADAMTSL3). Using existing available genome-wide association study databases, LM increasing alleles of SNPs in sumo wrestler loci were associated with an adverse metabolic profile, whereas LM increasing alleles of SNPs in ""body builder"" loci were associated with metabolic protection.

With technological advances, pharmacogenomic research has evolved from candidate gene analyses to genome-wide association studies. Here, we integrate deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) information with drug prescription and ADE data from Estonian electronic health record (EHR) databases to evaluate genome- and pharmacome-wide associations on an unprecedented scale. We leveraged WGS data of 2240 Estonian Biobank participants and imputed all single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) with allele counts over 2 for 13,986 genotyped participants. Overall, we identified 41 (10 novel) loss-of-function and 567 (134 novel) missense variants in 64 very important pharmacogenes. The majority of the detected variants were very rare with frequencies below 0.05%, and 6 of the novel loss-of-function and 99 of the missense variants were only detected as single alleles (allele count = 1). We also validated documented pharmacogenetic associations and detected new independent variants in known gene-drug pairs.

Polyols have been promoted as sugar substitutes in prevention of oral diseases. We aimed to reveal the effect of candies containing erythritol, xylitol or control (sorbitol) on salivary microbiome. Ninety children (11.3 ± 0.6 years) consumed candies during 3 years. Microbial communities were profiled using Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing and real-time PCR. The dominant phyla in saliva were Firmicutes (39.1%), Proteobacteria (26.1%), Bacteroidetes (14.7%), Actinobacteria (12%) and Fusobacteria (6%). The microbiome of erythritol group significantly differed from that of the other groups. Both erythritol and xylitol reduced the number of observed bacterial phylotypes in comparison to the control group. The relative abundance of the genera Veillonella, Streptococcus and Fusobacterium were higher while that of Bergeyella lower after erythritol intervention when comparing with control. The lowest prevalence of caries-related mutans streptococci corresponded with the lowest clinical caries markers in the erythritol group. Daily consumption of erythritol, xylitol or control candies has a specific influence on the salivary microbiome composition in schoolchildren.

Most inversions promoted by homologous recombination occur recurrently in humans and great apes and they are not tagged by SNPs. Furthermore, there is an enrichment of inversions showing signatures of positive or balancing selection, diverse functional effects, such as gene disruption and gene-expression changes, or association with phenotypic traits.

Estonian Biobank,31283802,Computational framework for targeted high-coverage sequencing based NIPT.,"Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) enables accurate detection of fetal chromosomal trisomies. The majority of publicly available computational methods for sequencing-based NIPT analyses rely on low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data and are not applicable for targeted high-coverage sequencing data from cell-free DNA samples. Here, we present a novel computational framework for a targeted high-coverage sequencing-based NIPT analysis. The developed framework uses a hidden Markov model (HMM) in conjunction with a supplemental machine learning model, such as decision tree (DT) or support vector machine (SVM), to detect fetal trisomy and parental origin of additional fetal chromosomes. These models were developed using simulated datasets covering a wide range of biologically relevant scenarios with various chromosomal quantities, parental origins of extra chromosomes, fetal DNA fractions, and sequencing read depths. Developed models were tested on simulated and experimental targeted sequencing datasets. Consequently, we determined the functional feasibility and limitations of each proposed approach and demonstrated that read count-based HMM achieved the best overall classification accuracy of 0.89 for detecting fetal euploidies and trisomies on simulated dataset. Furthermore, we show that by using the DT and SVM on the HMM classification results, it was possible to increase the final trisomy classification accuracy to 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. We demonstrate that read count and allelic ratio-based models can achieve a high accuracy (up to 0.98) for detecting fetal trisomy even if the fetal fraction is as low as 2%. Currently, existing commercial NIPT analysis requires at least 4% of fetal fraction, which can be possibly a challenge in case of early gestational age (<10 weeks) or high maternal body mass index (>35 kg/m2). More accurate detection can be achieved at higher sequencing depth using HMM in conjunction with supplemental models, which significantly improve the trisomy detection especially in borderline scenarios (e.g., very low fetal fraction) and enables to perform NIPT even earlier than 10 weeks of pregnancy.",PloS one,2019,Alleles; Down Syndrome; Female; Genetic Testing; Gestational Age; Humans; Machine Learning; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Prenatal Diagnosis,False,7

In a cross-sectional and prospective study, we examined how food neophobia is associated with dietary quality, health-related biomarkers, and disease outcome incidence in Finnish and Estonian adult populations. The study was conducted based on subsamples of the Finnish DIetary, Lifestyle, and Genetic determinants of Obesity and Metabolic syndrome (DILGOM) cohort (n = 2982; age range: 25-74 y) and the Estonian Biobank cohort (n = 1109; age range: 18-83 y). The level of food neophobia was assessed using the Food Neophobia Scale, dietary quality was evaluated using the Baltic Sea Diet Score (BSDS), and biomarker profiles were determined using an NMR metabolomics platform. Disease outcome information was gathered from national health registries. Follow-up data on the NMR-based metabolomic profiles and disease outcomes were available in both populations. Food neophobia associated significantly (adjusted P < 0.05) with health-related biomarkers [e.g., ω-3 (n-3) fatty acids, citrate, α1-acid glycoprotein, HDL, and MUFA] in the Finnish DILGOM cohort.

Prediagnostic blood samples from individuals who were to receive a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer between 1 month and 17 years after sampling (N = 356) and age- and sex-matched controls (N = 887) were collected from five large population cohorts (HUNT2, HUNT3, FINRISK, Estonian Biobank, Rotterdam Study). We applied proton nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics on the Nightingale platform.

Stratification in quintiles showed a 1.5-fold elevated risk for the lowest 20% of glutamine and a 2.2-fold increased risk for the lowest 20% of histidine. Stratification by time to diagnosis suggested glutamine to be involved in an earlier process (2 to 5 years before diagnosis), and histidine in a process closer to the actual onset (<2 years).

Estonian Biobank,30718923,A distinctive DNA methylation pattern in insufficient sleep.,"Short sleep duration or insomnia may lead to an increased risk of various psychiatric and cardio-metabolic conditions. Since DNA methylation plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression, studies of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) might be valuable for understanding the mechanisms underlying insomnia. We performed a cross-sectional genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in relation to self-reported insufficient sleep in individuals from a community-based sample (79 men, aged 39.3 ± 7.3), and in relation to shift work disorder in an occupational cohort (26 men, aged 44.9 ± 9.0). The analysis of DNA methylation data revealed that genes corresponding to selected DMPs form a distinctive pathway: ""Nervous System Development"" (FDR P value < 0.05). We found that 78% of the DMPs were hypomethylated in cases in both cohorts, suggesting that insufficient sleep may be associated with loss of DNA methylation. A karyoplot revealed clusters of DMPs at various chromosomal regions, including 12 DMPs on chromosome 17, previously associated with Smith-Magenis syndrome, a rare condition comprising disturbed sleep and inverse circadian rhythm. Our findings give novel insights into the DNA methylation patterns associated with sleep loss, possibly modifying processes related to neuroplasticity and neurodegeneration.

Estonian Biobank,30634901,Manhattan Harvester and Cropper: a system for GWAS peak detection.,"Selection of interesting regions from genome wide association studies (GWAS) is typically performed by eyeballing of Manhattan Plots. This is no longer possible with thousands of different phenotypes. There is a need for tools that can automatically detect genomic regions that correspond to what the experienced researcher perceives as peaks worthwhile of further study. We developed Manhattan Harvester, a tool designed for ""peak extraction"" from GWAS summary files and computation of parameters characterizing various aspects of individual peaks. We present the algorithms used and a model for creating a general quality score that evaluates peaks similarly to that of a human researcher. Our tool Cropper utilizes a graphical interface for inspecting, cropping and subsetting Manhattan Plot regions. Cropper is used to validate and visualize the regions detected by Manhattan Harvester. We conclude that our tools fill the current void in automatically screening large number of GWAS output files in batch mode. The interesting regions are detected and quantified by various parameters by Manhattan Harvester. Cropper offers graphical tools for in-depth inspection of the regions.

We explored here how unsupervised data-driven metabolic subgrouping, based on comprehensive lipoprotein subclass data, would work in large-scale population cohorts. We applied a self-organizing map (SOM) artificial intelligence methodology to define subgroups based on detailed lipoprotein profiles in a population-based cohort (n = 5789) and utilised the trained SOM in an independent cohort (n = 7607). We identified four SOM-based subgroups of individuals with distinct lipoprotein profiles and CHD risk and compared those to univariate subgrouping by apolipoprotein B quartiles. The SOM-based subgroup with highest concentrations for non-HDL measures had the highest, and the subgroup with lowest concentrations, the lowest risk for CHD. However, apolipoprotein B quartiles produced better resolution of risk than the SOM-based subgroups and also striking dose-response behaviour. These results suggest that the majority of lipoprotein-mediated CHD risk is explained by apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein particles. Therefore, even advanced multivariate subgrouping, with comprehensive data on lipoprotein metabolism, may not advance CHD risk assessment.",Atherosclerosis,2020,Adult; Aged; Apolipoproteins B; Artificial Intelligence; Cohort Studies; Coronary Disease; Female; Finland; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Phenotype; Risk Assessment; Survival Analysis,False,0

Estonian Biobank,31588999,Variation near MTNR1A associates with early development and interacts with seasons.,"Melatonin is a circadian regulatory hormone with neuroprotective properties. We have previously demonstrated the association of the genetic variant rs12506228 near the melatonin receptor 1A gene (MTNR1A) with intolerance to shift-work. Furthermore, this variant has been connected to Alzheimer's disease. Because of the previously suggested role of melatonin signalling in foetal neurocognitive and sleep development, we studied here the association of rs12506228 with early development. The study sample comprised 8-month-old infants from the Finnish CHILD-SLEEP birth cohort (n = 1,301). Parental questionnaires assessed socioemotional, communication and motor development, as well as sleep length and night awakenings. The A allele of rs12506228 showed an association with slower socioemotional (p = .025) and communication (p = .0098) development, but no direct association with sleep. However, the association of the Finnish seasons with infant sleep length interacted with rs12506228. Taken together, rs12506228 near MTNR1A, which has been previously linked to adult and elderly traits, is shown here to associate with slower early cognitive development. In addition, these results suggest that the darker seasons associate with longer infant sleep time, but only in the absence of the rs12506228 AA genotype. Because the risk allele has been connected to fewer brain MT1 melatonin receptors, these associations may reflect the influence of decreased melatonin signalling in early development.",Journal of sleep research,2020,"Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Genetic Variation; Humans; Infant; Male; Phenotype; Receptor, Melatonin, MT1; Seasons",False,9
Estonian Biobank,30698716,Multiancestry Genome-Wide Association Study of Lipid Levels Incorporating Gene-Alcohol Interactions.,"A person's lipid profile is influenced by genetic variants and alcohol consumption, but the contribution of interactions between these exposures has not been studied. We therefore incorporated gene-alcohol interactions into a multiancestry genome-wide association study of levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. We included 45 studies in stage 1 (genome-wide discovery) and 66 studies in stage 2 (focused follow-up), for a total of 394,584 individuals from 5 ancestry groups. Analyses covered the period July 2014-November 2017. Genetic main effects and interaction effects were jointly assessed by means of a 2-degrees-of-freedom (df) test, and a 1-df test was used to assess the interaction effects alone. Variants at 495 loci were at least suggestively associated (P < 1 × 10-6) with lipid levels in stage 1 and were evaluated in stage 2, followed by combined analyses of stage 1 and stage 2. In the combined analysis of stages 1 and 2, a total of 147 independent loci were associated with lipid levels at P < 5 × 10-8 using 2-df tests, of which 18 were novel. No genome-wide-significant associations were found testing the interaction effect alone. The novel loci included several genes (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 (PCSK5), vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB), and apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 1 (APOBEC1) complementation factor (A1CF)) that have a putative role in lipid metabolism on the basis of existing evidence from cellular and experimental models.",American journal of epidemiology,2019,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Life Style; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Racial Groups; Triglycerides; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor B; Young Adult",False,4

Estonian Biobank,31332826,Analytical strategies to include the X-chromosome in variance heterogeneity analyses: Evidence for trait-specific polygenic variance structure.,"Genotype-stratified variance of a quantitative trait could differ in the presence of gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. Genetic markers associated with phenotypic variance are thus considered promising candidates for follow-up interaction or joint location-scale analyses. However, as in studies of main effects, the X-chromosome is routinely excluded from ""whole-genome"" scans due to analytical challenges. Specifically, as males carry only one copy of the X-chromosome, the inherent sex-genotype dependency could bias the trait-genotype association, through sexual dimorphism in quantitative traits with sex-specific means or variances. Here we investigate phenotypic variance heterogeneity associated with X-chromosome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and propose valid and powerful strategies. Among those, a generalized Levene's test has adequate power and remains robust to sexual dimorphism. An alternative approach is a sex-stratified analysis but at the cost of slightly reduced power and modeling flexibility. We applied both methods to an Estonian study of gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL; n = 841), and two complex trait studies of height, hip, and waist circumferences, and body mass index from Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; n = 2,073) and UK Biobank (UKB; n = 327,393). Consistent with previous eQTL findings on mean, we found some but no conclusive evidence for cis regulators being enriched for variance association. SNP rs2681646 is associated with variance of waist circumference (p = 9.5E-07) at X-chromosome-wide significance in UKB, with a suggestive female-specific effect in MESA (p = 0.048).

Estonian Biobank,31080083,The Arrival of Siberian Ancestry Connecting the Eastern Baltic to Uralic Speakers further East.,"In this study, we compare the genetic ancestry of individuals from two as yet genetically unstudied cultural traditions in Estonia in the context of available modern and ancient datasets: 15 from the Late Bronze Age stone-cist graves (1200-400 BC) (EstBA) and 6 from the Pre-Roman Iron Age tarand cemeteries (800/500 BC-50 AD) (EstIA). We also included 5 Pre-Roman to Roman Iron Age Ingrian (500 BC-450 AD) (IngIA) and 7 Middle Age Estonian (1200-1600 AD) (EstMA) individuals to build a dataset for studying the demographic history of the northern parts of the Eastern Baltic from the earliest layer of Mesolithic to modern times. Our findings are consistent with EstBA receiving gene flow from regions with strong Western hunter-gatherer (WHG) affinities and EstIA from populations related to modern Siberians. The latter inference is in accordance with Y chromosome (chrY) distributions in present day populations of the Eastern Baltic, as well as patterns of autosomal variation in the majority of the westernmost Uralic speakers [1-5]. This ancestry reached the coasts of the Baltic Sea no later than the mid-first millennium BC; i.e., in the same time window as the diversification of west Uralic (Finnic) languages [6]. Furthermore, phenotypic traits often associated with modern Northern Europeans, like light eyes, hair, and skin, as well as lactose tolerance, can be traced back to the Bronze Age in the Eastern Baltic.

We aimed to validate existing and identify novel metabolic biomarkers predictive of future diabetes in large cohorts of young adults. NMR metabolomics was used to quantify 229 circulating metabolic measures in 11,896 individuals from four Finnish observational cohorts (baseline age 24-45 years). Associations between baseline metabolites and risk of developing diabetes during 8-15 years of follow-up (392 incident cases) were adjusted for sex, age, BMI and fasting glucose. Prospective metabolite associations were also tested with fasting glucose, 2 h glucose and HOMA-IR at follow-up. Out of 229 metabolic measures, 113 were associated with incident type 2 diabetes in meta-analysis of the four cohorts (ORs per 1 SD: 0.59-1.50; p< 0.0009). Among the strongest biomarkers of diabetes risk were branched-chain and aromatic amino acids (OR 1.31-1.33) and triacylglycerol within VLDL particles (OR 1.33-1.50), as well as linoleic n-6 fatty acid (OR 0.75) and non-esterified cholesterol in large HDL particles (OR 0.59). The metabolic biomarkers were more strongly associated with deterioration in post-load glucose and insulin resistance than with future fasting hyperglycaemia. A multi-metabolite score comprised of phenylalanine, non-esterified cholesterol in large HDL and the ratio of cholesteryl ester to total lipid in large VLDL was associated with future diabetes risk (OR 10.1 comparing individuals in upper vs lower fifth of the multi-metabolite score) in one of the cohorts (mean age 31 years). Metabolic biomarkers across multiple molecular pathways are already predictive of the long-term risk of diabetes in young adults.

Estonian Biobank,30640898,PAIRUP-MS: Pathway analysis and imputation to relate unknowns in profiles from mass spectrometry-based metabolite data.,"Metabolomics is a powerful approach for discovering biomarkers and for characterizing the biochemical consequences of genetic variation. While untargeted metabolite profiling can measure thousands of signals in a single experiment, many biologically meaningful signals cannot be readily identified as known metabolites nor compared across datasets, making it difficult to infer biology and to conduct well-powered meta-analyses across studies. To overcome these challenges, we developed a suite of computational methods, PAIRUP-MS, to match metabolite signals across mass spectrometry-based profiling datasets and to generate metabolic pathway annotations for these signals. To pair up signals measured in different datasets, where retention times (RT) are often not comparable or even available, we implemented an imputation-based approach that only requires mass-to-charge ratios (m/z). As validation, we treated each shared known metabolite as an unmatched signal and showed that PAIRUP-MS correctly matched 70-88% of these metabolites from among thousands of signals, equaling or outperforming a standard m/z- and RT-based approach. We performed further validation using genetic data: the most stringent set of matched signals and shared knowns showed comparable consistency of genetic associations across datasets. Next, we developed a pathway reconstitution method to annotate unknown signals using curated metabolic pathways containing known metabolites. We performed genetic validation for the generated annotations, showing that annotated signals associated with gene variants were more likely to be enriched for pathways functionally related to the genes compared to random expectation. Finally, we applied PAIRUP-MS to study associations between metabolites and genetic variants or body mass index (BMI) across multiple datasets, identifying up to ~6 times more significant signals and many more BMI-associated pathways compared to the standard practice of only analyzing known metabolites. These results demonstrate that PAIRUP-MS enables analysis of unknown signals in a robust, biologically meaningful manner and provides a path to more comprehensive, well-powered studies of untargeted metabolomics data.",PLoS computational biology,2019,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Computational Biology; Databases, Factual; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metabolome; Metabolomics",False,0

Here, we present a cost-effective high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy method to estimate HDL-CEC directly from serum. We applied the new method in a population-based study of 7603 individuals including 574 who developed incident coronary heart disease (CHD) during 15 years of follow-up, making this the largest quantitative study for HDL-CEC. As estimated by NMR-spectroscopy, a 1-SD higher HDL-CEC was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD (hazards ratio, 0.86; 95%CI, 0.79-0.93, adjusted for traditional risk factors and HDL-C). These findings are consistent with published associations based on in vitro cell assays.

It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of obesity traits on other non-communicable diseases. Also, it is largely unexplored whether there are any sex-specific differences in the causal effects of obesity traits on cardiometabolic diseases and other leading causes of death. We constructed sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRS) for three obesity traits; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI, including 565, 324, and 337 genetic variants, respectively. These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the obesity traits and leading causes of mortality in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. We also investigated associations with potential mediators, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran's Q-test (Phet). A Mendelian randomization analysis of 228,466 women and 195,041 men showed that obesity causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type 2 and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic liver disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. Higher BMI led to higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men (Phet = 1.4×10-5). Waist-hip-ratio led to a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phet = 3.7×10-6) and higher risk of chronic renal failure (Phet = 1.0×10-4) in men than women.

This requirement, however, is not compatible with the present scattered and traditional access governance structures, where legal and ethical frameworks often form an obstacle for effective sharing. Moreover, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is demanding increasingly rigorous administration from all those organisations processing personal data. The BBMRI-LPC project (Biobanking and Biomolecular Research Infrastructure - Large Prospective Cohorts) assembled 21 LPCs from 10 countries and two EU-wide multinational cohort networks with a key objective to promote collaborative innovative transnational research proposed by external researchers on the broad field of common chronic diseases, and analyze the gaps and needs involved. BBMRI-LPC organized three scientific calls to offer European investigators an opportunity to gain free of charge transnational access to research material available in the participating cohorts. A total of 11 high-quality research proposals involving multiple prospective cohorts were granted, and the access process in the individual projects carefully monitored. Divergent access governance structures, complex legal and ethical frameworks and heterogeneous procedures were identified as currently constituting substantial obstacles for sample and data transfer in Europe.

Estonian Biobank,30897348,Association of Chromosome 9p21 With Subsequent Coronary Heart Disease Events.,"Genetic variation at chromosome 9p21 is a recognized risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, its effect on disease progression and subsequent events is unclear, raising questions about its value for stratification of residual risk. A variant at chromosome 9p21 (rs1333049) was tested for association with subsequent events during follow-up in 103 357 Europeans with established CHD at baseline from the GENIUS-CHD (Genetics of Subsequent Coronary Heart Disease) Consortium (73.1% male, mean age 62.9 years). The primary outcome, subsequent CHD death or myocardial infarction (CHD death/myocardial infarction), occurred in 13 040 of the 93 115 participants with available outcome data. Effect estimates were compared with case/control risk obtained from the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (Coronary Artery Disease Genome-wide Replication and Meta-analysis [CARDIoGRAM] plus The Coronary Artery Disease [C4D] Genetics) including 47 222 CHD cases and 122 264 controls free of CHD. Meta-analyses revealed no significant association between chromosome 9p21 and the primary outcome of CHD death/myocardial infarction among those with established CHD at baseline (GENIUS-CHD odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.99-1.05). This contrasted with a strong association in CARDIoGRAMPlusC4D odds ratio 1.20; 95% CI, 1.18-1.22; P for interaction <0.001 compared with the GENIUS-CHD estimate. Similarly, no clear associations were identified for additional subsequent outcomes, including all-cause death, although we found a modest positive association between chromosome 9p21 and subsequent revascularization (odds ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.09). In contrast to studies comparing individuals with CHD to disease-free controls, we found no clear association between genetic variation at chromosome 9p21 and risk of subsequent acute CHD events when all individuals had CHD at baseline.

The function of miR-10a-5p in the skin has not been previously studied. The aim of the current study was to examine miR-10a-5p expression, regulation, and function in keratinocytes (KCs) in association with atopic dermatitis (AD). The expression of miR-10a-5p and its target genes was analyzed using RT-qPCR, mRNA array analysis, in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence. The transfection of miRNA mimics, cell cycle distribution analysis, and luciferase assays was used to study miR-10a-5p functions in human primary KCs. miR-10a-5p was found to be upregulated in lesional skin from patients with AD and in proliferating KCs. Array and pathway analysis of IL-1β-stimulated KCs revealed that miR-10a-5p inhibited many genes that affect cell cycle progression and only a few inflammation-related genes. Accordingly, fewer cells in S-phase and reduced proliferation were detected as characteristics of miR-10a-5p-transfected KCs. The influence of miR-10a-5p on cell proliferation was also evident in KCs induced by AD-related cytokines, including IL-4, IL-17, and IL-1β, as measured by the capacity to strongly suppress the expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67. Among AD-related putative direct target genes, we verified hyaluronan synthase 3, a damage-associated positive regulator of KC migration and proliferation, as a direct target of miR-10a-5p. miR-10a-5p inhibits KC proliferation and directly targets hyaluronan synthase 3 and thereby may modulate AD-associated processes in the skin.",Allergy,2019,"Adult; Cell Cycle; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cytokines; Dermatitis, Atopic; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Keratinocytes; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; RNA Interference; Skin; Young Adult",False,4
Estonian Biobank,30801692,Interferon signature in patients with STAT1 gain-of-function mutation is epigenetically determined.,"STAT1 gain-of-function (GOF) variants lead to defective Th17 cell development and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), but frequently also to autoimmunity. Stimulation of cells with STAT1 inducing cytokines like interferons (IFN) result in hyperphosphorylation and delayed dephosphorylation of GOF STAT1. However, the mechanism how the delayed dephosphorylation exactly causes the increased expression of STAT1-dependent genes, and how the intracellular signal transduction from cytokine receptors is affected, remains unknown. In this study we show that the circulating levels of IFN-α were not persistently elevated in STAT1 GOF patients. Nevertheless, the expression of interferon signature genes was evident even in the patient with low or undetectable serum IFN-α levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that the active chromatin mark trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3), was significantly enriched in areas associated with interferon-stimulated genes in STAT1 GOF cells in comparison to cells from healthy donors.

Here, we perform a series of rare variant analyses across 73,185 women and men to identify genes that contribute to primary gonadal dysfunction. We report CSMD1, a complement regulatory protein on chromosome 8p23, as a strong candidate locus in both sexes. We show that CSMD1 is enriched at the germ-cell/somatic-cell interface in both male and female gonads. Csmd1-knockout males show increased rates of infertility with significantly increased complement C3 protein deposition in the testes, accompanied by severe histological degeneration. Knockout females show significant reduction in ovarian quality and breeding success, as well as mammary branching impairment. Double knockout of Csmd1 and C3 causes non-additive reduction in breeding success, suggesting that CSMD1 and the complement pathway play an important role in the normal postnatal development of the gonads in both sexes.",Nature communications,2019,"Age Factors; Animals; Complement C3; Female; Genetic Association Studies; Genotype; Humans; Infertility; Male; Mammary Glands, Animal; Membrane Proteins; Menopause; Mice, Knockout; Mutation; Ovary; Sexual Maturation; Testis; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",False,7

We analyzed quantitative clinical information, exome sequencing, and microarray data from 757 probands and 233 parents and siblings who carry disease-associated variants. The number of rare likely deleterious variants in functionally intolerant genes (""other hits"") correlated with expression of neurodevelopmental phenotypes in probands with 16p12.1 deletion (n=23, p=0.004) and in autism probands carrying gene-disruptive variants (n=184, p=0.03) compared with their carrier family members.

Estonian Biobank,30423443,Diverse phenotype in patients with complex I deficiency due to mutations in NDUFB11.,"Mitochondrial complex I deficiency is the most frequent mitochondrial disorder presenting in childhood and the mutational spectrum is highly heterogeneous. The NDUFB11 gene is one of the recently identified genes, which is located in the short arm of the X-chromosome. Here we report clinical, biochemical, functional and genetic findings of two male patients with lactic acidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and isolated complex I deficiency due to de novo hemizygous mutations (c.286C > T and c.328C > T) in the NDUFB11 gene. Neither of them had any skin manifestations. The NDUFB11 gene encodes a relatively small integral membrane protein NDUFB11, which is essential for the assembly of an active complex I. The expression levels of this protein was decreased in both patient cells and a lentiviral complementation experiment also supported the notion that the complex I deficiency in those two patients is caused by NDUFB11 genetic defects. Our findings together with a review of the thirteen previously described patients demonstrate a wide spectrum of clinical features associated with NDUFB11-related complex I deficiency. However, histiocytoid cardiomyopathy and/or congenital sideroblastic anemia could be indicative for mutation in the NDUFB11 gene, while the clinical manifestation of the same mutation can be highly variable.",European journal of medical genetics,2019,"Adolescent; Anemia, Sideroblastic; Child, Preschool; Electron Transport Complex I; Genetic Diseases, X-Linked; Humans; Male; Mitochondrial Diseases; Mutation; Phenotype",False,7
Estonian Biobank,31070104,Genetic Determinants of Circulating Glycine Levels and Risk of Coronary Artery Disease.,"Background Recent studies have revealed sexually dimorphic associations between the carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 locus, intermediates of the metabolic pathway leading from choline to urea, and risk of coronary artery disease ( CAD ) in women. Based on evidence from the literature, the atheroprotective association with carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 could be mediated by the strong genetic effect of this locus on increased circulating glycine levels. Methods and Results We sought to identify additional genetic determinants of circulating glycine levels by carrying out a meta-analysis of genome-wide association study data in up to 30 118 subjects of European ancestry. Mendelian randomization and other analytical approaches were used to determine whether glycine-associated variants were associated with CAD and traditional risk factors. Twelve loci were significantly associated with circulating glycine levels, 7 of which were not previously known to be involved in glycine metabolism ( ACADM , PHGDH , COX 18- ADAMTS 3, PSPH , TRIB 1, PTPRD , and ABO ). Glycine-raising alleles at several loci individually exhibited directionally consistent associations with decreased risk of CAD . However, these effects could not be attributed directly to glycine because of associations with other CAD -related traits. By comparison, genetic models that only included the 2 variants directly involved in glycine degradation and for which there were no other pleiotropic associations were not associated with risk of CAD or blood pressure, lipid levels, and obesity-related traits. Conclusions These results provide additional insight into the genetic architecture of glycine metabolism, but do not yield conclusive evidence for a causal relationship between circulating levels of this amino acid and risk of CAD in humans.",Journal of the American Heart Association,2019,"Biomarkers; Coronary Artery Disease; Female; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Glycine; Humans; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors",False,7

Here, we clarify associations of genetic inhibition of CETP on detailed lipoprotein measures and compare those to genetic inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). We used an allele associated with lower CETP expression (rs247617) to mimic CETP inhibition and an allele associated with lower HMGCR expression (rs12916) to mimic the well-known effects of statins for comparison. The study consists of 65,427 participants of European ancestries with detailed lipoprotein subclass profiling from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Genetic associations were scaled to 10% reduction in relative risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). We also examined observational associations of the lipoprotein subclass measures with risk of incident CHD in 3 population-based cohorts totalling 616 incident cases and 13,564 controls during 8-year follow-up. Genetic inhibition of CETP and HMGCR resulted in near-identical associations with LDL cholesterol concentration estimated by the Friedewald equation. Inhibition of HMGCR had relatively consistent associations on lower cholesterol concentrations across all apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. In contrast, the associations of the inhibition of CETP were stronger on lower remnant and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, but there were no associations on cholesterol concentrations in LDL defined by particle size (diameter 18-26 nm) (-0.02 SD LDL defined by particle size; 95% CI: -0.10 to 0.05 for CETP versus -0.24 SD, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.18 for HMGCR). Inhibition of CETP was strongly associated with lower proportion of triglycerides in all high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. In observational analyses, a higher triglyceride composition within HDL subclasses was associated with higher risk of CHD, independently of total cholesterol and triglycerides (strongest hazard ratio per 1 SD higher triglyceride composition in very large HDL 1.35; 95% CI: 1.18-1.54). In conclusion, CETP inhibition does not appear to affect size-specific LDL cholesterol but is likely to lower CHD risk by lowering concentrations of other atherogenic, apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (such as remnant and VLDLs). Inhibition of CETP also lowers triglyceride composition in HDL particles, a phenomenon reflecting combined effects of circulating HDL, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B-containing particles and is associated with a lower CHD risk in observational analyses.

Estonian Biobank,31127295,A multi-ancestry genome-wide study incorporating gene-smoking interactions identifies multiple new loci for pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure.,"Elevated blood pressure (BP), a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, is influenced by both genetic and lifestyle factors. Cigarette smoking is one such lifestyle factor. Across five ancestries, we performed a genome-wide gene-smoking interaction study of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure (PP) in 129 913 individuals in stage 1 and follow-up analysis in 480 178 additional individuals in stage 2. We report here 136 loci significantly associated with MAP and/or PP.

We also identified nine new signals near known loci. Of the 136 loci, 8 showed significant interaction with smoking status. They include CSMD1 previously reported for insulin resistance and BP in the spontaneously hypertensive rats. Many of the 38 new loci show biologic plausibility for a role in BP regulation.

The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed (see decision letter). Ageing happens to us all, and as the cabaret singer Maurice Chevalier pointed out, ""old age is not that bad when you consider the alternative"". Yet, the growing ageing population of most developed countries presents challenges to healthcare systems and government finances. For many older people, long periods of ill health are part of the end of life, and so a better understanding of ageing could offer the opportunity to prolong healthy living into old age. Ageing is complex and takes a long time to study – a lifetime in fact. This makes it difficult to discern its causes, among the countless possibilities based on an individual’s genes, behaviour or environment. While thousands of regions in an individual’s genetic makeup are known to influence their risk of different diseases, those that affect how long they will live have proved harder to disentangle. Timmers et al. sought to pinpoint such regions, and then use this information to predict, based on their DNA, whether someone had a better or worse chance of living longer than average. The DNA of over 500,000 people was read to reveal the specific ‘genetic fingerprints’ of each participant. Then, after asking each of the participants how long both of their parents had lived, Timmers et al. pinpointed 12 DNA regions that affect lifespan. Five of these regions were new and had not been linked to lifespan before. Across the twelve as a whole several were known to be involved in Alzheimer’s disease, smoking-related cancer or heart disease. Looking at the entire genome, Timmers et al. could then predict a lifespan score for each individual, and when they sorted participants into ten groups based on these scores they found that top group lived five years longer than the bottom, on average. Many factors beside genetics influence how long a person will live and our lifespan cannot be read from our DNA alone. Nevertheless, Timmers et al. had hoped to narrow down their search and discover specific genes that directly influence how quickly people age, beyond diseases. If such genes exist, their effects were too small to be detected in this study. The next step will be to expand the study to include more participants, which will hopefully pinpoint further genomic regions and help disentangle the biology of ageing and disease.",eLife,2019,"Age Factors; Aged; Bayes Theorem; DNA Methylation; Disease; Female; Genetic Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Humans; Longevity; Male; Middle Aged; Multifactorial Inheritance; Parents; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Sex Characteristics; Signal Transduction; Survival Analysis",False,0

Participants of the Estonian biobank have expressed support for the disclosure of clinically significant findings. With an Estonian biobank cohort, we applied a genotype-first approach, contacted carriers, and offered return of results with genetic counseling. We evaluated participants' responses to and the clinical utility of the reporting of actionable genetic findings. Twenty-two of 40 contacted carriers of 17 pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants responded and chose to receive results. Eight of these 22 participants qualified for high-risk assessment based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. Twenty of 21 counseled participants appreciated being contacted. Relatives of 10 participants underwent cascade screening. Five of 16 eligible female BRCA1/2 variant carriers chose to undergo risk-reducing surgery, and 10 adhered to surveillance recommendations over the 30-month follow-up period. We recommend the return of results to population-based biobank participants; this approach could be viewed as a model for population-wide genetic testing.

Estonian Biobank,33011775,Development and validation of two SCORE-based cardiovascular risk prediction models for Eastern Europe: a multicohort study.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction models are used in Western European countries, but less so in Eastern European countries where rates of CVD can be two to four times higher. We recalibrated the SCORE prediction model for three Eastern European countries and evaluated the impact of adding seven behavioural and psychosocial risk factors to the model. We developed and validated models using data from the prospective HAPIEE cohort study with 14 598 participants from Russia, Poland, and the Czech Republic (derivation cohort, median follow-up 7.2 years, 338 fatal CVD cases) and Estonian Biobank data with 4632 participants (validation cohort, median follow-up 8.3 years, 91 fatal CVD cases). The first model (recalibrated SCORE) used the same risk factors as in the SCORE model. The second model (HAPIEE SCORE) added education, employment, marital status, depression, body mass index, physical inactivity, and antihypertensive use. Discrimination of the original SCORE model (C-statistic 0.78 in the derivation and 0.83 in the validation cohorts) was improved in recalibrated SCORE (0.82 and 0.85) and HAPIEE SCORE (0.84 and 0.87) models. After dichotomizing risk at the clinically meaningful threshold of 5%, and when comparing the final HAPIEE SCORE model against the original SCORE model, the net reclassification improvement was 0.07 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.11] in the derivation cohort and 0.14 (95% CI 0.04-0.25) in the validation cohort. Our recalibrated SCORE may be more appropriate than the conventional SCORE for some Eastern European populations.

Estonian Biobank,32537749,Validating the doubly weighted genetic risk score for the prediction of type 2 diabetes in the Lifelines and Estonian Biobank cohorts.,"As many cases of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are likely to remain undiagnosed, better tools for early detection of high-risk individuals are needed to prevent or postpone the disease. We investigated the value of the doubly weighted genetic risk score (dwGRS) for the prediction of incident T2D in the Lifelines and Estonian Biobank (EstBB) cohorts. The dwGRS uses an additional weight for each single nucleotide polymorphism in the risk score, to correct for ""Winner's curse"" bias in the effect size estimates. The traditional (single-weighted genetic risk score; swGRS) and dwGRS were calculated for participants in Lifelines (n = 12,018) and EstBB (n = 34,129). The dwGRS was found to have stronger association with incident T2D (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.26 [95% confidence interval: 1.10-1.43] and HR = 1.35 [1.28-1.42]) compared to the swGRS (HR = 1.21 [1.07-1.38] and HR = 1.25 [1.19-1.32]) in Lifelines and EstBB, respectively. Comparing the 5-year predicted risks from the models with and without the dwGRS, the continuous net reclassification index was 0.140 (0.034-0.243; p = .009 Lifelines), and 0.257 (0.194-0.319; p < 2 × 10",Genetic epidemiology,2020,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biological Specimen Banks; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Estonia; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Genetic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Young Adult",False,4
Estonian Biobank,33081811,Identification of fetal unmodified and 5-hydroxymethylated CG sites in maternal cell-free DNA for non-invasive prenatal testing.,"Massively parallel sequencing of maternal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is widely used to test fetal genetic abnormalities in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). However, sequencing-based approaches are still of high cost. Building upon previous knowledge that placenta, the main source of fetal circulating DNA, is hypomethylated in comparison to maternal tissue counterparts of cfDNA, we propose that targeting either unmodified or 5-hydroxymethylated CG sites specifically enriches fetal genetic material and reduces numbers of required analytical sequencing reads thereby decreasing cost of a test. We employed uTOPseq and hmTOP-seq approaches which combine covalent derivatization of unmodified or hydroxymethylated CG sites, respectively, with next generation sequencing, or quantitative real-time PCR. We detected increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels in fetal chorionic villi (CV) tissue samples as compared with peripheral blood. Using our previously developed uTOP-seq and hmTOP-seq approaches we obtained whole-genome uCG and 5hmCG maps of 10 CV tissue and 38 cfDNA samples in total. Our results indicated that, in contrast to conventional whole genome sequencing, such epigenomic analysis highly specifically enriches fetal DNA fragments from maternal cfDNA. While both our approaches yielded 100% accuracy in detecting Down syndrome in fetuses, hmTOP-seq maintained such accuracy at ultra-low sequencing depths using only one million reads. We identified 2164 and 1589 placenta-specific differentially modified and 5-hydroxymethylated regions, respectively, in chromosome 21, as well as 3490 and 2002 Down syndrome-specific differentially modified and 5-hydroxymethylated regions, respectively, that can be used as biomarkers for identification of Down syndrome or other epigenetic diseases of a fetus. uTOP-seq and hmTOP-seq approaches provide a cost-efficient and sensitive epigenetic analysis of fetal abnormalities in maternal cfDNA. The results demonstrated that T21 fetuses contain a perturbed epigenome and also indicated that fetal cfDNA might originate from fetal tissues other than placental chorionic villi. Robust covalent derivatization followed by targeted analysis of fetal DNA by sequencing or qPCR presents an attractive strategy that could help achieve superior sensitivity and specificity in prenatal diagnostics.",Clinical epigenetics,2020,"5-Methylcytosine; Adult; Cell-Free Nucleic Acids; DNA Methylation; Down Syndrome; Epigenomics; Female; Fetal Diseases; Fetus; Genetic Testing; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Male; Placenta; Pregnancy; Prenatal Diagnosis; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Trisomy",False,3
Estonian Biobank,32535895,Global Frequencies of Clinically Important HLA Alleles and Their Implications For the Cost-Effectiveness of Preemptive Pharmacogenetic Testing.,"Immune-mediated drug hypersensitivity reactions are an important source of iatrogenic morbidity and mortality. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*57:01, HLA-B*15:02, HLA-A*31:01, and HLA-B*58:01 constitute established risk factors and preemptive genotyping of these HLA alleles in patients prior to the initiation of abacavir, carbamazepine, and allopurinol-based therapies can prevent toxicity and improve patient outcomes. However, the cost-effectiveness of preemptive HLA testing has only been evaluated in the United States and few countries in Europe and Asia. In this study, we consolidated HLA genotypes from 3.5-6.4 million individuals across up to 74 countries and modeled the country-specific cost-effectiveness of genetic testing. We find major ethnogeographic differences in risk allele prevalence, which translated into pronounced differences in the number of patients needed to test to prevent one case of severe hypersensitivity reactions between countries and populations. At incremental cost-effectiveness ratio thresholds of $40,000, testing of HLA-B*57:01 in patients initiating abacavir was cost-effective in the majority of countries with potential exceptions of East Asia, Saudi Arabia, Ghana, and Zimbabwe. For carbamazepine, preemptive genotyping of HLA-B*15:02 is only cost-effective across most of East and South Asia, whereas HLA-A*31:01 testing is likely to be cost-effective globally. Testing of HLA-B*58:01 is more likely to be cost-effective throughout Africa and Asia compared with Europe and the Americas.

The resulting score was validated with 33,616 individuals from two fully independent datasets and it is strongly associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.18 per point increase in score; 95% CI 1.14-1.22; p = 2.25e-16). When combined with Charlson comorbidity index, individuals with elevated medication score and comorbidity index had over six times higher risk (HR 6.30; 95% CI 3.84-10.3; AUC = 0.802) compared to individuals with a protective score profile.

Estonian Biobank,32107839,Monocytes present age-related changes in phospholipid concentration and decreased energy metabolism.,"Age-related changes at the cellular level include the dysregulation of metabolic and signaling pathways. Analyses of blood leukocytes have revealed a set of alterations that collectively lower their ability to fight infections and resolve inflammation later in life. We studied the transcriptomic, epigenetic, and metabolomic profiles of monocytes extracted from younger adults and individuals over the age of 65 years to map major age-dependent changes in their cellular physiology. We found that the monocytes from older persons displayed a decrease in the expression of ribosomal and mitochondrial protein genes and exhibited hypomethylation at the HLA class I locus. Additionally, we found elevated gene expression associated with cell motility, including the CX3CR1 and ARID5B genes, which have been associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the downregulation of two genes, PLA2G4B and ALOX15B, which belong to the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway involved in phosphatidylcholine conversion to anti-inflammatory lipoxins, correlated with increased phosphatidylcholine content in monocytes from older individuals. We found age-related changes in monocyte metabolic fitness, including reduced mitochondrial function and increased glycose consumption without the capacity to upregulate it during increased metabolic needs, and signs of increased oxidative stress and DNA damage. In conclusion, our results complement existing findings and elucidate the metabolic alterations that occur in monocytes during aging.",Aging cell,2020,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cellular Senescence; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Monocytes; Phospholipids",False,4

Here, we developed a high-resolution recombination rate mapping at 10 and 50 kb scale using high-coverage (20-30×) whole-genome sequenced data of 55 family trios from Finland and compared it to recombination rates of non-Finnish Europeans (NFE). We tested the downstream effects of the population-specific recombination rates in statistical phasing and genotype imputation in Finns as compared to the same analyses performed by using the NFE-based recombination rates. We found that Finnish recombination rates have a moderately high correlation (Spearman's ρ = 0.67-0.79) with NFE, although on average (across all autosomal chromosomes), Finnish rates (2.268 ± 0.4209 cM/Mb) are 12-14% lower than NFE (2.641 ± 0.5032 cM/Mb). Finnish recombination map was found to have no significant effect in haplotype phasing accuracy (switch error rates ~2%) and average imputation concordance rates (97-98% for common, 92-96% for low frequency and 78-90% for rare variants). Our results suggest that haplotype phasing and genotype imputation mostly depend on population-specific contexts like appropriate reference panels and their sample size, but not on population-specific recombination maps. Even though recombination rate estimates had some differences between the Finnish and NFE populations, haplotyping and imputation had not been noticeably affected by the recombination map used. Therefore, the currently available HapMap recombination maps seem robust for population-specific phasing and imputation pipelines, even in the context of relatively isolated populations like Finland.",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2021,"Algorithms; Finland; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Genotyping Techniques; Haplotypes; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Population; Recombination, Genetic",False,9
Estonian Biobank,33353473,Intraindividual Variability and Temporal Stability of Mid-Sleep on Free and Workdays.,"People differ in their sleep timings that are often referred to as a chronotype and can be operationalized as mid-sleep (midpoint between sleep onset and wake-up). The aims of the present studies were to examine intraindividual variability and longer-term temporal stability of mid-sleep on free and workdays, while also considering the effect of age. We used data from a 2-week experience sampling study of British university students (Study 1) and from a panel study of Estonian adults who filled in the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire twice up to 5 years apart (Study 2). Results of Study 1 showed that roughly 50% of the variance in daily mid-sleep scores across the 14-day period was attributed to intraindividual variability as indicated by the intraclass correlation coefficient. However, when the effect of free versus workdays was considered, the intraindividual variability in daily mid-sleep across 2 weeks was 0.71 the size of the interindividual variability. In Study 2, mid-sleep on free and workdays showed good levels of temporal stability-the retest correlations of mid-sleep on free and workdays were 0.66 and 0.58 when measured twice over a period of 0-1 to 5 years. The retest stability of mid-sleep scores on both free and workdays sharply increased from young adulthood and reached their peak when participants were in late 40 to early 50 years of age, indicating that age influences the stability of mid-sleep. Future long-term longitudinal studies are necessary to explore how age-related life circumstances and other possible factors may influence the intraindividual variability and temporal stability of mid-sleep.",Journal of biological rhythms,2021,Adolescent; Adult; Circadian Rhythm; Female; Humans; Individuality; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Sleep; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Young Adult,False,4
Estonian Biobank,31931463,Data-driven multivariate population subgrouping via lipoprotein phenotypes versus apolipoprotein B in the risk assessment of coronary heart disease.,"Population subgrouping has been suggested as means to improve coronary heart disease (CHD) risk assessment. We explored here how unsupervised data-driven metabolic subgrouping, based on comprehensive lipoprotein subclass data, would work in large-scale population cohorts. We applied a self-organizing map (SOM) artificial intelligence methodology to define subgroups based on detailed lipoprotein profiles in a population-based cohort (n = 5789) and utilised the trained SOM in an independent cohort (n = 7607). We identified four SOM-based subgroups of individuals with distinct lipoprotein profiles and CHD risk and compared those to univariate subgrouping by apolipoprotein B quartiles. The SOM-based subgroup with highest concentrations for non-HDL measures had the highest, and the subgroup with lowest concentrations, the lowest risk for CHD. However, apolipoprotein B quartiles produced better resolution of risk than the SOM-based subgroups and also striking dose-response behaviour. These results suggest that the majority of lipoprotein-mediated CHD risk is explained by apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein particles. Therefore, even advanced multivariate subgrouping, with comprehensive data on lipoprotein metabolism, may not advance CHD risk assessment.",Atherosclerosis,2020,Adult; Aged; Apolipoproteins B; Artificial Intelligence; Cohort Studies; Coronary Disease; Female; Finland; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Phenotype; Risk Assessment; Survival Analysis,False,0

Variants showing apparent association with CAD in stratified analyses or evidence of interaction were evaluated in a further 117 787 subjects (16 694 with CAD and 11 537 with T2D). None of the previously characterized CAD loci was found to have specific effects on CAD in T2D individuals, and a genome-wide interaction analysis found no new variants for CAD that could be considered T2D specific. When we considered the overall genetic correlations between CAD and its risk factors, we found no substantial differences in these relationships by T2D background. This study found no evidence that the genetic architecture of CAD differs in those with T2D compared with those without T2D.",Circulation.

Estonian Biobank,31588999,Variation near MTNR1A associates with early development and interacts with seasons.,"Melatonin is a circadian regulatory hormone with neuroprotective properties. We have previously demonstrated the association of the genetic variant rs12506228 near the melatonin receptor 1A gene (MTNR1A) with intolerance to shift-work. Furthermore, this variant has been connected to Alzheimer's disease. Because of the previously suggested role of melatonin signalling in foetal neurocognitive and sleep development, we studied here the association of rs12506228 with early development. The study sample comprised 8-month-old infants from the Finnish CHILD-SLEEP birth cohort (n = 1,301). Parental questionnaires assessed socioemotional, communication and motor development, as well as sleep length and night awakenings. The A allele of rs12506228 showed an association with slower socioemotional (p = .025) and communication (p = .0098) development, but no direct association with sleep. However, the association of the Finnish seasons with infant sleep length interacted with rs12506228. Taken together, rs12506228 near MTNR1A, which has been previously linked to adult and elderly traits, is shown here to associate with slower early cognitive development. In addition, these results suggest that the darker seasons associate with longer infant sleep time, but only in the absence of the rs12506228 AA genotype. Because the risk allele has been connected to fewer brain MT1 melatonin receptors, these associations may reflect the influence of decreased melatonin signalling in early development.",Journal of sleep research,2020,"Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Genetic Variation; Humans; Infant; Male; Phenotype; Receptor, Melatonin, MT1; Seasons",False,9

Estonian Biobank,32745133,A human-specific VNTR in the TRIB3 promoter causes gene expression variation between individuals.,"Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) is pseudokinase involved in intracellular regulatory processes and has been implicated in several diseases. In this article, we report that human TRIB3 promoter contains a 33-bp variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) and characterize the heterogeneity and function of this genetic element. Analysis of human populations around the world uncovered the existence of alleles ranging from 1 to 5 copies of the repeat, with 2-, 3- and 5-copy alleles being the most common but displaying considerable geographical differences in frequency. The repeated sequence overlaps a C/EBP-ATF transcriptional regulatory element and is highly conserved, but not repeated, in various mammalian species, including great apes. The repeat is however evident in Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes. Reporter plasmid experiments in human cell culture reveal that an increased copy number of the TRIB3 promoter 33-bp repeat results in increased transcriptional activity. In line with this, analysis of whole genome sequencing and RNA-Seq data from human cohorts demonstrates that the copy number of TRIB3 promoter 33-bp repeats is positively correlated with TRIB3 mRNA expression level in many tissues throughout the body. Moreover, the copy number of the TRIB3 33-bp repeat appears to be linked to known TRIB3 eQTL SNPs as well as TRIB3 SNPs reported in genetic association studies. Taken together, the results indicate that the promoter 33-bp VNTR constitutes a causal variant for TRIB3 expression variation between individuals and could underlie the results of SNP-based genetic studies.",PLoS genetics,2020,"Cell Cycle Proteins; Estonia; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Heterogeneity; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Humans; Male; Minisatellite Repeats; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; RNA-Seq; Repressor Proteins; Whole Genome Sequencing",False,9

Estonian Biobank,32467615,"Integrating untargeted metabolomics, genetically informed causal inference, and pathway enrichment to define the obesity metabolome.","Obesity and its associated diseases are major health problems characterized by extensive metabolic disturbances. Understanding the causal connections between these phenotypes and variation in metabolite levels can uncover relevant biology and inform novel intervention strategies. Recent studies have combined metabolite profiling with genetic instrumental variable (IV) analysis (Mendelian randomization) to infer the direction of causality between metabolites and obesity, but often omitted a large portion of untargeted profiling data consisting of unknown, unidentified metabolite signals. We expanded upon previous research by identifying body mass index (BMI)-associated metabolites in multiple untargeted metabolomics datasets, and then performing bidirectional IV analysis to classify metabolites based on their inferred causal relationships with BMI. Meta-analysis and pathway analysis of both known and unknown metabolites across datasets were enabled by our recently developed bioinformatics suite, PAIRUP-MS. We identified ten known metabolites that are more likely to be causes (e.g., alpha-hydroxybutyrate) or effects (e.g., valine) of BMI, or may have more complex bidirectional cause-effect relationships with BMI (e.g., glycine). Importantly, we also identified about five times more unknown than known metabolites in each of these three categories. Pathway analysis incorporating both known and unknown metabolites prioritized 40 enriched (p < 0.05) metabolite sets for the cause versus effect groups, providing further support that these two metabolite groups are linked to obesity via distinct biological mechanisms. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of our approach to uncover causal connections with obesity from untargeted metabolomics datasets.

Estonian Biobank,32306029,Cross-trait analyses with migraine reveal widespread pleiotropy and suggest a vascular component to migraine headache.,"Nearly a fifth of the world's population suffer from migraine headache, yet risk factors for this disease are poorly characterized. To further elucidate these factors, we conducted a genetic correlation analysis using cross-trait linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression between migraine headache and 47 traits from the UK Biobank. We then tested for possible causality between these phenotypes and migraine, using Mendelian randomization. In addition, we attempted replication of our findings in an independent genome-wide association study (GWAS) when available. We report multiple phenotypes with genetic correlation (P  < 1.06 × 10-3) with migraine, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, lipid levels, blood pressure, autoimmune and psychiatric phenotypes. In particular, we find evidence that blood pressure directly contributes to migraine and explains a previously suggested causal relationship between calcium and migraine. This is the largest genetic correlation analysis of migraine headache to date, both in terms of migraine GWAS sample size and the number of phenotypes tested. We find that migraine has a shared genetic basis with a large number of traits, indicating pervasive pleiotropy at migraine-associated loci.",International journal of epidemiology,2020,Genetic Pleiotropy; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Phenotype,False,5

An age-, sex- and APOE based risk score and family history were used to select cases most likely to harbor novel AD risk variants and controls least likely to develop AD by age 85 years. We tested ~1.5 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 50,000 insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels) for association to AD, using multiple models considering individual variants as well as gene-based tests aggregating rare, predicted functional, and loss of function variants. Sixteen single variants and 19 genes that met criteria for significant or suggestive associations after multiple-testing correction were evaluated for replication in four independent samples; three with whole exome sequencing (2,778 cases, 7,262 controls) and one with genome-wide genotyping imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel (9,343 cases, 11,527 controls).

Estonian Biobank,33110245,An expanded analysis framework for multivariate GWAS connects inflammatory biomarkers to functional variants and disease.,"Multivariate methods are known to increase the statistical power to detect associations in the case of shared genetic basis between phenotypes. They have, however, lacked essential analytic tools to follow-up and understand the biology underlying these associations. We developed a novel computational workflow for multivariate GWAS follow-up analyses, including fine-mapping and identification of the subset of traits driving associations (driver traits). Many follow-up tools require univariate regression coefficients which are lacking from multivariate results. Our method overcomes this problem by using Canonical Correlation Analysis to turn each multivariate association into its optimal univariate Linear Combination Phenotype (LCP). This enables an LCP-GWAS, which in turn generates the statistics required for follow-up analyses. We implemented our method on 12 highly correlated inflammatory biomarkers in a Finnish population-based study. Altogether, we identified 11 associations, four of which (F5, ABO, C1orf140 and PDGFRB) were not detected by biomarker-specific analyses. Fine-mapping identified 19 signals within the 11 loci and driver trait analysis determined the traits contributing to the associations.

At all sites, daily clinical data with emphasis on GI clinical symptoms were collected and intra-abdominal pressure measured. In five out of 11 sites, the biomarkers citrulline and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) were measured additionally. Cox models with time-dependent scores were used to analyze associations with 28- and 90-day mortality. The models were estimated with stratification for study center. We included 540 patients (224 with biomarker measurements) with median age of 65 years (range 18-94), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score of 38 (interquartile range 26-53) points, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 6 (interquartile range 3-9) points at admission.

This locus has been implicated in risk-taking behavior, smoking, and insomnia. SA showed strong genetic correlation with psychiatric disorders, particularly major depression, and also with smoking, pain, risk-taking behavior, sleep disturbances, lower educational attainment, reproductive traits, lower socioeconomic status, and poorer general health. After conditioning on psychiatric disorders, the genetic correlations between SA and psychiatric disorders decreased, whereas those with nonpsychiatric traits remained largely unchanged.

We sought to gain additional understanding of the genetic contribution to AD risk by using biobank resources. We completed a genome-wide meta-analysis of AD in 796,661 individuals (N We report 30 loci associating with AD (P < 5 × 10 These findings elucidate novel genetic pathways involved in AD pathophysiology.

The present study examines the relationships between sleep timing (chronotype), diurnal preferences, and the Five-Factor Model of personality traits at the phenotypic and genetic level. Self- and informant-reports of the NEO Personality Inventory-3, self-reports of the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, and DNA samples were available for 2,515 Estonian adults (M Results showed that higher Conscientiousness and lower Openness to Experience were significant predictors of earlier chronotype. At the level of facets, we found that more straightforward (A2) and excitement-seeking (E5), yet less self-disciplined (C5) people were more likely to have later chronotypes. The nuance-level Polypersonality score was correlated with chronotype at r = .28 (p < .001). Conscientiousness and Openness were genetically related with diurnal preferences. The polygenic score for morningness-eveningness significantly predicted the Polypersonality score. Phenotypic measures of chronotype and personality showed significant associations at all three of levels of the personality hierarchy. Our findings indicate that the relationship between personality and morningness-eveningness is partly due to genetic factors.

Estonian Biobank,34000646,Hybrid modelling for stroke care: Review and suggestions of new approaches for risk assessment and simulation of scenarios.,"Stroke is an example of a complex and multi-factorial disease involving multiple organs, timescales, and disease mechanisms. To deal with this complexity, and to realize Precision Medicine of stroke, mathematical models are needed. Such approaches include: 1) machine learning, 2) bioinformatic network models, and 3) mechanistic models. Since these three approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses, a hybrid modelling approach combining them would be the most beneficial. However, no concrete approach ready to be implemented for a specific disease has been presented to date. In this paper, we both review the strengths and weaknesses of the three approaches, and propose a roadmap for hybrid modelling in the case of stroke care. We focus on two main tasks needed for the clinical setting: a) For stroke risk calculation, we propose a new two-step approach, where non-linear mixed effects models and bioinformatic network models yield biomarkers which are used as input to a machine learning model and b) For simulation of care scenarios, we propose a new four-step approach, which revolves around iterations between simulations of the mechanistic models and imputations of non-modelled or non-measured variables.

We show in extensive simulation work the benefits BayesW provides in terms of number of discoveries, model performance and genomic prediction.

Estonian Biobank,34930164,Evaluating the prognostic performance of a polygenic risk score for breast cancer risk stratification.,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) could potentially improve breast cancer screening recommendations. Before a PRS can be considered for implementation, it needs rigorous evaluation, using performance measures that can inform about its future clinical value. To evaluate the prognostic performance of a regression model with a previously developed, prevalence-based PRS and age as predictors for breast cancer incidence in women from the Estonian biobank (EstBB) cohort; to compare it to the performance of a model including age only. We analyzed data on 30,312 women from the EstBB cohort. They entered the cohort between 2002 and 2011, were between 20 and 89 years, without a history of breast cancer, and with full 5-year follow-up by 2015. We examined PRS and other potential risk factors as possible predictors in Cox regression models for breast cancer incidence. With 10-fold cross-validation we estimated 3- and 5-year breast cancer incidence predicted by age alone and by PRS plus age, fitting models on 90% of the data. Calibration, discrimination, and reclassification were calculated on the left-out folds to express prognostic performance. A total of 101 (3.33‰) and 185 (6.1‰) incident breast cancers were observed within 3 and 5 years, respectively. For women in a defined screening age of 50-62 years, the ratio of observed vs PRS-age modelled 3-year incidence was 0.86 for women in the 75-85% PRS-group, 1.34 for the 85-95% PRS-group, and 1.41 for the top 5% PRS-group. For 5-year incidence, this was respectively 0.94, 1.15, and 1.08. Yet the number of breast cancer events was relatively low in each PRS-subgroup. For all women, the model's AUC was 0.720 (95% CI: 0.675-0.765) for 3-year and 0.704 (95% CI: 0.670-0.737) for 5-year follow-up, respectively, just 0.022 and 0.023 higher than for the model with age alone. Using a 1% risk prediction threshold, the 3-year NRI for the PRS-age model was 0.09, and 0.05 for 5 years. The model including PRS had modest incremental performance over one based on age only. A larger, independent study is needed to assess whether and how the PRS can meaningfully contribute to age, for developing more efficient screening strategies.",BMC cancer,2021,"Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Case-Control Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Estonia; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Incidence; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Young Adult",False,4

Estonian Biobank,34340992,Small RNA expression and miRNA modification dynamics in human oocytes and early embryos.,"Small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) play important roles during the oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET), when the maternal phenotype is reprogrammed and the embryo genome is gradually activated. The transcriptional program driving early human development has been studied with the focus mainly on protein-coding RNAs, and expression dynamics of sRNAs remain largely unexplored. We profiled sRNAs in human oocytes and early embryos using an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) method suitable for low inputs of material. We show that OET in humans is temporally coupled with the transition from predominant expression of oocyte short piRNAs (os-piRNAs) in oocytes, to activation of microRNA (miRNA) expression in cleavage stage embryos. Additionally, 3' mono- and oligoadenylation of miRNAs is markedly increased in zygotes. We hypothesize that this may modulate the function or stability of maternal miRNAs, some of which are retained throughout the first cell divisions in embryos. This study is the first of its kind elucidating the dynamics of sRNA expression and miRNA modification along a continuous trajectory of early human development and provides a valuable data set for in-depth interpretative analyses.",Genome research,2021,"Embryo, Mammalian; Humans; MicroRNAs; Oocytes; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Zygote",False,7

Genetic association studies have revealed several JIA susceptibility loci with the strongest effect size observed in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. Genome-wide association studies have augmented the number of JIA-associated loci, particularly for non-HLA genes. The aim of this study was to identify new associations at non-HLA loci predisposing to the risk of JIA development in Estonian patients. We performed genome-wide association analyses in an entire JIA case-control sample (All-JIA) and in a case-control sample for oligoarticular JIA, the most prevalent JIA subtype. The entire cohort was genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip arrays. After imputation, 16,583,468 variants were analyzed in 263 cases and 6956 controls. We demonstrated nominal evidence of association for 12 novel non-HLA loci not previously implicated in JIA predisposition. We replicated known JIA associations in CLEC16A and VCTN1 regions in the oligoarticular JIA sample. The strongest associations in the All-JIA analysis were identified at PRKG1 (P = 2,54 × 10 This study increases the number of known JIA risk loci and provides additional evidence for the existence of overlapping genetic risk loci between JIA and other autoimmune diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis. The reported loci are involved in molecular pathways of immunological relevance and likely represent genomic regions that confer susceptibility to JIA in Estonian patients. Key Points • Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common childhood rheumatic disease with heterogeneous presentation and genetic predisposition. • Present genome-wide association study for Estonian JIA patients is first of its kind in Northern and Northeastern Europe. • The results of the present study increase the knowledge about JIA risk loci replicating some previously described associations, so adding weight to their relevance and describing novel loci. • The study provides additional evidence for the existence of overlapping genetic risk loci between JIA and other autoimmune diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis.",Clinical rheumatology,2021,"Arthritis, Juvenile; Case-Control Studies; Estonia; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,5

Estonian Biobank,32535895,Global Frequencies of Clinically Important HLA Alleles and Their Implications For the Cost-Effectiveness of Preemptive Pharmacogenetic Testing.,"Immune-mediated drug hypersensitivity reactions are an important source of iatrogenic morbidity and mortality. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*57:01, HLA-B*15:02, HLA-A*31:01, and HLA-B*58:01 constitute established risk factors and preemptive genotyping of these HLA alleles in patients prior to the initiation of abacavir, carbamazepine, and allopurinol-based therapies can prevent toxicity and improve patient outcomes. However, the cost-effectiveness of preemptive HLA testing has only been evaluated in the United States and few countries in Europe and Asia. In this study, we consolidated HLA genotypes from 3.5-6.4 million individuals across up to 74 countries and modeled the country-specific cost-effectiveness of genetic testing. We find major ethnogeographic differences in risk allele prevalence, which translated into pronounced differences in the number of patients needed to test to prevent one case of severe hypersensitivity reactions between countries and populations. At incremental cost-effectiveness ratio thresholds of $40,000, testing of HLA-B*57:01 in patients initiating abacavir was cost-effective in the majority of countries with potential exceptions of East Asia, Saudi Arabia, Ghana, and Zimbabwe. For carbamazepine, preemptive genotyping of HLA-B*15:02 is only cost-effective across most of East and South Asia, whereas HLA-A*31:01 testing is likely to be cost-effective globally. Testing of HLA-B*58:01 is more likely to be cost-effective throughout Africa and Asia compared with Europe and the Americas.

The purpose of this study was to describe differences in arterial stiffness (AS), central blood pressure (cBP), and the role of BBs on cBP in patients with AF compared to healthy individuals. The authors included 76 patients with paroxysmal/persistent AF. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and cBP were measured and compared with data from 75 healthy individuals. Patients with AF had higher PWV (8.0 m/s vs. 7.2 m/s, p < .001), central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) (118 mm Hg vs. 114 mm Hg, p = .033), central pulse pressure (cPP) (39 mm Hg vs. 37 mm Hg, p = .035) and lower pulse pressure amplification (PPA) (1.24 vs. 1.30, p = .015), without differences in peripheral blood pressure (pBP) and heart rate (HR). AF patients had significantly increased PWV (β= 0.500, p = .010, adjusted R² = 0.37) after adjustment for confounding factors. The use of BBs significantly reduced PPA (β = -0.059, p = .017, adjusted R² = 0.30). AF patients have higher PWV, cSBP, cPP, and lower PPA, compared to healthy patients. These findings support the role of AS in the development of AF.

Estonian Biobank,33249422,High-resolution population-specific recombination rates and their effect on phasing and genotype imputation.,"Previous research has shown that using population-specific reference panels has a significant effect on downstream population genomic analyses like haplotype phasing, genotype imputation, and association, especially in the context of population isolates. Here, we developed a high-resolution recombination rate mapping at 10 and 50 kb scale using high-coverage (20-30×) whole-genome sequenced data of 55 family trios from Finland and compared it to recombination rates of non-Finnish Europeans (NFE). We tested the downstream effects of the population-specific recombination rates in statistical phasing and genotype imputation in Finns as compared to the same analyses performed by using the NFE-based recombination rates. We found that Finnish recombination rates have a moderately high correlation (Spearman's ρ = 0.67-0.79) with NFE, although on average (across all autosomal chromosomes), Finnish rates (2.268 ± 0.4209 cM/Mb) are 12-14% lower than NFE (2.641 ± 0.5032 cM/Mb). Finnish recombination map was found to have no significant effect in haplotype phasing accuracy (switch error rates ~2%) and average imputation concordance rates (97-98% for common, 92-96% for low frequency and 78-90% for rare variants). Our results suggest that haplotype phasing and genotype imputation mostly depend on population-specific contexts like appropriate reference panels and their sample size, but not on population-specific recombination maps. Even though recombination rate estimates had some differences between the Finnish and NFE populations, haplotyping and imputation had not been noticeably affected by the recombination map used. Therefore, the currently available HapMap recombination maps seem robust for population-specific phasing and imputation pipelines, even in the context of relatively isolated populations like Finland.",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2021,"Algorithms; Finland; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Genotyping Techniques; Haplotypes; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Population; Recombination, Genetic",False,9
Estonian Biobank,33710309,Multivariate genome-wide analysis of immunoglobulin G N-glycosylation identifies new loci pleiotropic with immune function.,"The N-glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) affects its structure and function. It has been demonstrated that IgG N-glycosylation patterns are inherited as complex quantitative traits. Genome-wide association studies identified loci harboring genes encoding enzymes directly involved in protein glycosylation as well as loci likely to be involved in regulation of glycosylation biochemical pathways. Many of these loci could be linked to immune functions and risk of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The aim of the present study was to discover and replicate new loci associated with IgG N-glycosylation and to investigate possible pleiotropic effects of these loci onto immune function and the risk of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We conducted a multivariate genome-wide association analysis of 23 IgG N-glycosylation traits measured in 8090 individuals of European ancestry. The discovery stage was followed up by replication in 3147 people and in silico functional analysis. Our study increased the total number of replicated loci from 22 to 29. For the discovered loci, we suggest a number of genes potentially involved in the control of IgG N-glycosylation. Among the new loci, two (near RNF168 and TNFRSF13B) were previously implicated in rare immune deficiencies and were associated with levels of circulating immunoglobulins. For one new locus (near AP5B1/OVOL1), we demonstrated a potential pleiotropic effect on the risk of asthma.

The aims of the present studies were to examine intraindividual variability and longer-term temporal stability of mid-sleep on free and workdays, while also considering the effect of age. We used data from a 2-week experience sampling study of British university students (Study 1) and from a panel study of Estonian adults who filled in the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire twice up to 5 years apart (Study 2). Results of Study 1 showed that roughly 50% of the variance in daily mid-sleep scores across the 14-day period was attributed to intraindividual variability as indicated by the intraclass correlation coefficient. However, when the effect of free versus workdays was considered, the intraindividual variability in daily mid-sleep across 2 weeks was 0.71 the size of the interindividual variability. In Study 2, mid-sleep on free and workdays showed good levels of temporal stability-the retest correlations of mid-sleep on free and workdays were 0.66 and 0.58 when measured twice over a period of 0-1 to 5 years. The retest stability of mid-sleep scores on both free and workdays sharply increased from young adulthood and reached their peak when participants were in late 40 to early 50 years of age, indicating that age influences the stability of mid-sleep.

The 100 replicated, epigenome-wide significant (p < 1.1E-7) CpGs explain 11.6% of the serum urate variance. At SLC2A9, the serum urate locus with the largest effect in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), five CpGs are associated with SLC2A9 gene expression. Four CpGs at SLC2A9 have significant causal effects on serum urate levels and/or gout, and two of these partly mediate the effects of urate-associated GWAS variants. In other genes, including SLC7A11 and PHGDH, 17 urate-associated CpGs are associated with conditions defining metabolic syndrome, suggesting that these CpGs may represent a blood DNA methylation signature of cardiometabolic risk factors. This study demonstrates that EWAS can provide new insights into GWAS loci and the correlation of serum urate with other complex traits.",Nature communications,2021,"Amino Acid Transport System y+; Cohort Studies; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Epigenome; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Glucose Transport Proteins, Facilitative; Gout; Humans; Male; Uric Acid",False,5

Low SES is a risk factor for hypertension and high blood pressure (BP). To identify novel BP loci, we performed multi-ancestry meta-analyses accounting for gene-educational attainment interactions using two variables, ""Some College"" (yes/no) and ""Graduated College"" (yes/no). Interactions were evaluated using both a 1 degree of freedom (DF) interaction term and a 2DF joint test of genetic and interaction effects. Analyses were performed for systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure. We pursued genome-wide interrogation in Stage 1 studies (N = 117 438) and follow-up on promising variants in Stage 2 studies (N = 293 787) in five ancestry groups. Through combined meta-analyses of Stages 1 and 2, we identified 84 known and 18 novel BP loci at genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10",Molecular psychiatry,2021,"Blood Pressure; Epistasis, Genetic; Genetic Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Hypertension; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,6
Estonian Biobank,33110245,An expanded analysis framework for multivariate GWAS connects inflammatory biomarkers to functional variants and disease.,"Multivariate methods are known to increase the statistical power to detect associations in the case of shared genetic basis between phenotypes. They have, however, lacked essential analytic tools to follow-up and understand the biology underlying these associations. We developed a novel computational workflow for multivariate GWAS follow-up analyses, including fine-mapping and identification of the subset of traits driving associations (driver traits). Many follow-up tools require univariate regression coefficients which are lacking from multivariate results. Our method overcomes this problem by using Canonical Correlation Analysis to turn each multivariate association into its optimal univariate Linear Combination Phenotype (LCP). This enables an LCP-GWAS, which in turn generates the statistics required for follow-up analyses. We implemented our method on 12 highly correlated inflammatory biomarkers in a Finnish population-based study. Altogether, we identified 11 associations, four of which (F5, ABO, C1orf140 and PDGFRB) were not detected by biomarker-specific analyses. Fine-mapping identified 19 signals within the 11 loci and driver trait analysis determined the traits contributing to the associations. A phenome-wide association study on the 19 representative variants from the signals in 176,899 individuals from the FinnGen study revealed 53 disease associations (p < 1 × 10",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2021,Aged; Biomarkers; Canonical Correlation Analysis; Cytokines; Disease; Female; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Serpin E2,False,0

We harmonized and meta-analyzed rCNVs from nearly one million individuals to construct a genome-wide catalog of dosage sensitivity across 54 disorders, which defined 163 dosage sensitive segments associated with at least one disorder. These segments were typically gene dense and often harbored dominant dosage sensitive driver genes, which we were able to prioritize using statistical fine-mapping. Finally, we designed an ensemble machine-learning model to predict probabilities of dosage sensitivity (pHaplo & pTriplo) for all autosomal genes, which identified 2,987 haploinsufficient and 1,559 triplosensitive genes, including 648 that were uniquely triplosensitive.

Estonian Biobank,35165703,Estimation of recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular event risk in patients with established cardiovascular disease: the updated SMART2 algorithm.,"The 10-year risk of recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events in patients with established ASCVD can be estimated with the Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) risk score, and may help refine clinical management. To broaden generalizability across regions, we updated the existing tool (SMART2 risk score) and recalibrated it with regional incidence rates and assessed its performance in external populations. Individuals with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, or abdominal aortic aneurysms were included from the Utrecht Cardiovascular Cohort-SMART cohort [n = 8355; 1706 ASCVD events during a median follow-up of 8.2 years (interquartile range 4.2-12.5)] to derive a 10-year risk prediction model for recurrent ASCVD events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular mortality) using a Fine and Gray competing risk-adjusted model. The model was recalibrated to four regions across Europe, and to Asia (excluding Japan), Japan, Australia, North America, and Latin America using contemporary cohort data from each target region. External validation used data from seven cohorts [Clinical Practice Research Datalink, SWEDEHEART, the international REduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) Registry, Estonian Biobank, Spanish Biomarkers in Acute Coronary Syndrome and Biomarkers in Acute Myocardial Infarction (BACS/BAMI), the Norwegian COgnitive Impairment After STroke, and Bialystok PLUS/Polaspire] and included 369 044 individuals with established ASCVD of whom 62 807 experienced an ASCVD event.

The clinical utility of the model was demonstrated across a range of clinically relevant treatment thresholds for intensified treatment options. The SMART2 risk score provides an updated, validated tool for the prediction of recurrent ASCVD events in patients with established ASCVD across European and non-European populations.

Estonian Biobank,34861974,"Dissecting the Shared Genetic Architecture of Suicide Attempt, Psychiatric Disorders, and Known Risk Factors.","Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, and nonfatal suicide attempts, which occur far more frequently, are a major source of disability and social and economic burden. Both have substantial genetic etiology, which is partially shared and partially distinct from that of related psychiatric disorders. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 29,782 suicide attempt (SA) cases and 519,961 controls in the International Suicide Genetics Consortium (ISGC). The GWAS of SA was conditioned on psychiatric disorders using GWAS summary statistics via multitrait-based conditional and joint analysis, to remove genetic effects on SA mediated by psychiatric disorders. We investigated the shared and divergent genetic architectures of SA, psychiatric disorders, and other known risk factors. Two loci reached genome-wide significance for SA: the major histocompatibility complex and an intergenic locus on chromosome 7, the latter of which remained associated with SA after conditioning on psychiatric disorders and replicated in an independent cohort from the Million Veteran Program. This locus has been implicated in risk-taking behavior, smoking, and insomnia. SA showed strong genetic correlation with psychiatric disorders, particularly major depression, and also with smoking, pain, risk-taking behavior, sleep disturbances, lower educational attainment, reproductive traits, lower socioeconomic status, and poorer general health. After conditioning on psychiatric disorders, the genetic correlations between SA and psychiatric disorders decreased, whereas those with nonpsychiatric traits remained largely unchanged. Our results identify a risk locus that contributes more strongly to SA than other phenotypes and suggest a shared underlying biology between SA and known risk factors that is not mediated by psychiatric disorders.",Biological psychiatry,2022,"Depressive Disorder, Major; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Mental Disorders; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Suicide, Attempted",False,8

Current glaucoma medications work by lowering intraocular pressure (IOP), a risk factor for glaucoma, but most treatments do not directly target the pathological changes leading to increased IOP, which can manifest as medication resistance as disease progresses. To identify physiological modulators of IOP, we performed genome- and exome-wide association analysis in >129,000 individuals with IOP measurements and extended these findings to an analysis of glaucoma risk. We report the identification and functional characterization of rare coding variants (including loss-of-function variants) in ANGPTL7 associated with reduction in IOP and glaucoma protection. We validated the human genetics findings in mice by establishing that Angptl7 knockout mice have lower (~2 mmHg) basal IOP compared to wild-type, with a trend towards lower IOP also in heterozygotes. Conversely, increasing murine Angptl7 levels via injection into mouse eyes increases the IOP. We also show that acute Angptl7 silencing in adult mice lowers the IOP (~2-4 mmHg), reproducing the observations in knockout mice. Collectively, our data suggest that ANGPTL7 is important for IOP homeostasis and is amenable to therapeutic modulation to help maintain a healthy IOP that can prevent onset or slow the progression of glaucoma.",Communications biology,2022,"Adult; Angiopoietin-Like Protein 7; Angiopoietin-like Proteins; Animals; Blindness; Glaucoma; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Mice; Mice, Knockout",False,7

Estonian Biobank,36154123,Cross-Ancestry Investigation of Venous Thromboembolism Genomic Predictors.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a life-threatening vascular event with environmental and genetic determinants. Recent VTE genome-wide association studies (GWAS) meta-analyses involved nearly 30 000 VTE cases and identified up to 40 genetic loci associated with VTE risk, including loci not previously suspected to play a role in hemostasis. The aim of our research was to expand discovery of new genetic loci associated with VTE by using cross-ancestry genomic resources. We present new cross-ancestry meta-analyzed GWAS results involving up to 81 669 VTE cases from 30 studies, with replication of novel loci in independent populations and loci characterization through in silico genomic interrogations. In our genetic discovery effort that included 55 330 participants with VTE (47 822 European, 6320 African, and 1188 Hispanic ancestry), we identified 48 novel associations, of which 34 were replicated after correction for multiple testing. In our combined discovery-replication analysis (81 669 VTE participants) and ancestry-stratified meta-analyses (European, African, and Hispanic), we identified another 44 novel associations, which are new candidate VTE-associated loci requiring replication. In total, across all GWAS meta-analyses, we identified 135 independent genomic loci significantly associated with VTE risk. A genetic risk score of the significantly associated loci in Europeans identified a 6-fold increase in risk for those in the top 1% of scores compared with those with average scores. We also identified 31 novel transcript associations in transcriptome-wide association studies and 8 novel candidate genes with protein quantitative-trait locus Mendelian randomization analyses. In silico interrogations of hemostasis and hematology traits and a large phenome-wide association analysis of the 135 GWAS loci provided insights to biological pathways contributing to VTE, with some loci contributing to VTE through well-characterized coagulation pathways and others providing new data on the role of hematology traits, particularly platelet function. Many of the replicated loci are outside of known or currently hypothesized pathways to thrombosis. Our cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analyses identified new loci associated with VTE.

To determine whether ovarian function is necessary for genetic risk factors for PCOS to produce nonreproductive phenotypes. Cohort of 176 360 men in the UK Biobank and replication cohort of 37 348 men in the Estonian Biobank. We calculated individual PCOS polygenic risk scores (PRS), tested for association of these PRS with PCOS-related phenotypes using linear and logistic regression and performed mediation analysis. For every 1 SD increase in the PCOS PRS, men had increased odds of obesity (odds ratio [OR]: 1.09; 95% CI, 1.08-1.10; P = 1 × 10-49), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (OR: 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05-1.10; P = 3 × 10-12), coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR: 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; P = 0.0029), and marked androgenic alopecia (OR: 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05; P = 3 × 10-5). Body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c, triglycerides, and free androgen index increased as the PRS increased, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and SHBG decreased (all P < .0001). The association between the PRS and CAD appeared to be completely mediated by BMI, whereas the associations with T2DM and marked androgenic alopecia appeared to be partially mediated by BMI.

According to previous studies, CHEK2 is the most frequent moderate-risk breast cancer predisposition gene. The study aimed to analyse the frequency and mutational spectrum of CHEK2 PV/LPVs in the Baltic states region and perform a literature review on the subject. The study includes two cohorts - population-based Estonian biobank (EstBB) (N-152 349) and breast cancer affected cases from Latvia (N-105). In the cohort from Latvia, CHEK2, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 testing with next-generation sequencing (NGS) was carried out in selected breast cancer cases. In the EstBB, the full SNP genotyped dataset Global Screening Array (GSA) (N-152 349) was used to screen CHEK2 PV/LPVs and variants c.319+2T > A (p.(?)), c.444+1G>A (p.(?)), c.433C > T (p.Arg145Trp), c.283C > T (p.Arg95*) in CHEK2 are reported from this dataset.

Moreover, a literature overview was performed on April 1, 2021, using the PubMed search of keywords 'CHEK2', 'breast cancer', 'Estonia', 'Lithuania', 'Latvia', 'Poland', 'Belarus' and 'Russia'. In the breast cancer affected cohort from Latvia 6 CHEK2 variants, classified as PV/LPVs, were observed (6/105; 5.7%), including recurrent ones c.470T > C (p.Ile157Thr) (1.9%) and del5395(ex9-10del; (p.Met304Leufs*16)) (1.9%), as well as single ones - c.1100delC (p.Thr367Metfs*15) (1%) and c.444+1G>A (p.(?)) (1%). From EstBB NGS data (N-4776) CHEK2 variant c.470T > C (p.Ile157Thr) was detected in 8.6% of cases, c.1100delC (p.Thr367Metfs*15) in 0.6% and c.444+1G>A (p.(?)) in 0.2% of cases. In the EstBB full cohort of SNP array data (N-152 349) CHEK2 variant c.444+1G>A (p.(?)) was detected in 0.02% of cases, c.319+2T > A (p.(?)) in 0.09% of cases, c.433C > T (p.Arg145Trp) in 0.02% of cases and c.283C > T (p.Arg95*) in <0.001% of cases. For the literature review altogether, 49 PubMed articles were found, 23 of which were relevant, representing CHEK2 PV/LPVs in the population of interest. Ten publications are from Poland, eight from Russia, three from Latvia and two from Belarus. This study is the first combined report on complete CHEK2 PV/LPVs screening in selected breast cancer affected cases in Latvia and large-scale population screening in Estonia, providing insight into the CHEK2 mutational spectrum in the Baltic states region. The initial results are in line with other studies that CHEK2 PV/LPVs frequency is around 5-6% of selected breast cancer cases. Here we report three CHEK2 PV/LPV - c.319+2T > A (p.(?)), c.433C > T (p.Arg145Trp), c.283C > T (p.Arg95*), that are novel for the Baltic states region.

We called CNVs in 331,522 UK Biobank participants and performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) between the copy number of CNV-proxy probes and 57 continuous traits, revealing 131 signals spanning 47 phenotypes. Our analysis recapitulated well-known associations (e.g., 1q21 and height), revealed the pleiotropy of recurrent CNVs (e.g., 26 and 16 traits for 16p11.2-BP4-BP5 and 22q11.21, respectively), and suggested gene functionalities (e.g., MARF1 in female reproduction). Forty-eight CNV signals (38%) overlapped with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-GWASs signals for the same trait. For instance, deletion of PDZK1, which encodes a urate transporter scaffold protein, decreased serum urate levels, while deletion of RHD, which encodes the Rhesus blood group D antigen, associated with hematological traits. Other signals overlapped Mendelian disorder regions, suggesting variable expressivity and broad impact of these loci, as illustrated by signals mapping to Rotor syndrome (SLCO1B1/3), renal cysts and diabetes syndrome (HNF1B), or Charcot-Marie-Tooth (PMP22) loci. Total CNV burden negatively impacted 35 traits, leading to increased adiposity, liver/kidney damage, and decreased intelligence and physical capacity. Thirty traits remained burden associated after correcting for CNV-GWAS signals, pointing to a polygenic CNV architecture. The burden negatively correlated with socio-economic indicators, parental lifespan, and age (survivorship proxy), suggesting a contribution to decreased longevity. Together, our results showcase how studying CNVs can expand biological insights, emphasizing the critical role of this mutational class in shaping human traits and arguing in favor of a continuum between Mendelian and complex diseases.",American journal of human genetics,2022,"DNA Copy Number Variations; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1; Multifactorial Inheritance; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",False,7
Estonian Biobank,35987817,Genetic and modifiable risk factors combine multiplicatively in common disease.,"The joint contribution of genetic and environmental exposures to noncommunicable diseases is not well characterized. We modeled the cumulative effects of common risk alleles and their prevalence variations with classical risk factors. We analyzed mathematically and statistically numbers and effect sizes of established risk alleles for coronary artery disease (CAD) and other conditions. In UK Biobank, risk alleles counts in the lowest (175.4) and highest decile (205.7) of the distribution differed by only 16.9%, which nevertheless increased CAD prevalence 3.4-fold (p < 0.01). Irrespective of the affected gene, a single risk allele multiplied the effects of all others carried by a person, resulting in a 2.9-fold stronger effect size in the top versus the bottom decile (p < 0.01) and an exponential increase in risk (R > 0.94). Classical risk factors shifted effect sizes to the steep upslope of the logarithmic function linking risk allele numbers with CAD prevalence. Similar phenomena were observed in the Estonian Biobank and for risk alleles affecting diabetes mellitus, breast and prostate cancer. Alleles predisposing to common diseases can be carried safely in large numbers, but few additional ones lead to sharp risk increments. Here, we describe exponential functions by which risk alleles combine interchangeably but multiplicatively with each other and with modifiable risk factors to affect prevalence.

Estonian Biobank,35978133,Inframe insertion and splice site variants in MFGE8 associate with protection against coronary atherosclerosis.,"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of premature death and disability worldwide, with both genetic and environmental determinants. While genome-wide association studies have identified multiple genetic loci associated with cardiovascular diseases, exact genes driving these associations remain mostly uncovered. Due to Finland's population history, many deleterious and high-impact variants are enriched in the Finnish population giving a possibility to find genetic associations for protein-truncating variants that likely tie the association to a gene and that would not be detected elsewhere. In a large Finnish biobank study FinnGen, we identified an association between an inframe insertion rs534125149 in MFGE8 (encoding lactadherin) and protection against coronary atherosclerosis. This variant is highly enriched in Finland, and the protective association was replicated in meta-analysis of BioBank Japan and Estonian biobank. Additionally, we identified a protective association between splice acceptor variant rs201988637 in MFGE8 and coronary atherosclerosis, independent of the rs534125149, with no significant risk-increasing associations. This variant was also associated with lower pulse pressure, pointing towards a function of MFGE8 in arterial aging also in humans in addition to previous evidence in mice.

Endometriosis and IBS both have several similar unspecific symptoms, such as recurrent abdominal pain, cramping and anxiety, and both diseases affect young women and are associated with a number of comorbidities causing a poor quality of life. However, a detailed study, revealing the full spectrum of endometriosis and IBS comorbidities in the same study population, is lacking. This article presents a retrospective in silico analysis of the data from a large nationwide biobank-based cohort consisting of 121 773 women. After excluding all first- and second-degree relatives, the data of up to 65 421 women were analyzed. International Classification of Disease-10 diagnosis main codes associated with endometriosis (N80) and IBS (K58) diagnoses were identified from the Estonian Biobank dataset by linking with the Estonian Health Insurance Fund and other relevant registries. The associations between N80 and K58 and other diagnosis codes were tested using logistic regression, adjusting for age at recruitment and 10 genetic principal components to account for potential population stratification. Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple testing. Both women with endometriosis and IBS suffered from more conditions compared to the control group, with 226 and 428 diagnosis codes statistically significantly more frequent in women with respective diagnosis compared to controls. Women suffering from both conditions had 275 significantly associated comorbidities. A remarkable proportion of women with IBS or endometriosis suffered also from endometriosis (9.0%) or IBS (13.6%), respectively. In endometriosis, the most prevalent diagnoses were related to diseases of the genitourinary system (33 N-category codes) and in women with IBS, the most associated diagnoses were related to digestive disorders and gastrointestinal tract (52 codes from K-category). Among the most significant diagnoses in endometriosis were uterine leiomyomas (D25), menstrual disorders (N92) and infertility (N97) (P < 1 × 10-315 for all), and in IBS, lactose intolerance (E73), gastritis and duodenitis (K29) and functional dyspepsia (K30) were in the top list of most significant comorbidities (P < 1 × 10-315 for all). The information about the severity stages of endometriosis and subtypes of IBS was not available for analysis. The findings may not be fully extrapolated to all female populations, because all participants were from one geographic area and had good access to health services. These findings support previous studies that have found a high prevalence of pre-selected comorbidities in women with endometriosis and IBS. However, taking into account the differences in the full spectrum of comorbidities of endometriosis and IBS may aid in diagnosing these disorders. Women and healthcare providers need to be aware that women with endometriosis are at high risks of complications during pregnancy and should be carefully monitored.

Estonian Biobank,34791234,Leveraging Northern European population history: novel low-frequency variants for polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Can we identify novel variants associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by leveraging the unique population history of Northern Europe? We identified three novel genome-wide significant associations with PCOS, with two putative independent causal variants in the checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) gene and a third in myosin X (MYO10). PCOS is a common, complex disorder with unknown aetiology. While previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped several loci associated with PCOS, the analysis of populations with unique population history and genetic makeup has the potential to uncover new low-frequency variants with larger effects. A population-based case-control GWAS was carried out. We identified PCOS cases from national registers by ICD codes (ICD-10 E28.2, ICD-9 256.4, or ICD-8 256.90), and all remaining women were considered controls. We then conducted a three-stage case-control GWAS: in the discovery phase, we had a total of 797 cases and 140 558 controls from the FinnGen study. For validation, we used an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank, including 2812 cases and 89 230 controls. Finally, we performed a joint meta-analysis of 3609 cases and 229 788 controls from both cohorts. Additionally, we reran the association analyses including BMI as a covariate, with 2169 cases and 160 321 controls from both cohorts. Two out of the three novel genome-wide significant variants associating with PCOS, rs145598156 (P = 3.6×10-8, odds ratio (OR) = 3.01 [2.02-4.50] minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.005) and rs182075939 (P = 1.9×10-16, OR = 1.69 [1.49-1.91], MAF = 0.04), were found to be enriched in the Finnish and Estonian populations and are tightly linked to a deletion c.1100delC (r2 = 0.95) and a missense I157T (r2 = 0.83) in CHEK2. The third novel association is a common variant near MYO10 (rs9312937, P = 1.7 × 10-8, OR = 1.16 [1.10-1.23], MAF = 0.44). We also replicated four previous reported associations near the genes Erb-B2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 4 (ERBB4), DENN Domain Containing 1A (DENND1A), FSH Subunit Beta (FSHB) and Zinc Finger And BTB Domain Containing 16 (ZBTB16). When adding BMI as a covariate only one of the novel variants remained genome-wide significant in the meta-analysis (the EstBB lead signal in CHEK2 rs182075939, P = 1.9×10-16, OR = 1.74 [1.5-2.01]) possibly owing to reduced sample size. The age- and BMI-adjusted GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics are available for download from the GWAS Catalog with accession numbers GCST90044902 and GCST90044903. The main limitation was the low prevalence of PCOS in registers; however, the ones with the diagnosis most likely represent the most severe cases. Also, BMI data were not available for all (63% for FinnGen, 76% for EstBB), and the biobank setting limited the accessibility of PCOS phenotypes and laboratory values. This study encourages the use of isolated populations to perform genetic association studies for the identification of rare variants contributing to the genetic landscape of complex diseases such as PCOS.

This post-hoc analysis of two databases (IROI and iSOFA study) tested the independent association between IAH and kidney failure. Mortality was assessed using four prespecified groups (IAH present, kidney failure present, IAH and kidney failure present and no IAH or kidney failure present). Of 825 critically ill patients, 302 (36.6%) developed kidney failure and 192 (23.7%) died during the first 90 days. Only 'Cumulative days with IAH grade II or more' was significantly associated with kidney failure (OR 1.29 (1.08-1.55), p = 0.003) while 'cumulative days with IAH grade I or more' (p = 0.135) or highest daily IAP (p = 0.062) was not. IAH combined with kidney failure was independently associated with 90-day mortality (OR 2.20 (1.20-4.05), p = 0.011), which was confirmed for higher grades of IAH (grade II or more) alone (OR 2.14 (1.07-4.30), p = 0.032) and combined with kidney failure (OR 3.25 (1.72-6.12), p < 0.001).

Estonian Biobank,36114277,Leveraging interindividual variability of regulatory activity for refining genetic regulation of gene expression in schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a polygenic psychiatric disorder with limited understanding about the mechanistic changes in gene expression regulation. To elucidate on this, we integrate interindividual variability of regulatory activity (ChIP-sequencing for H3K27ac histone mark) with gene expression and genotype data captured from the prefrontal cortex of 272 cases and controls. By measuring interindividual correlation among proximal chromatin peaks, we show that regulatory element activity is structured into 10,936 and 10,376 cis-regulatory domains in cases and controls, respectively. The schizophrenia-specific cis-regulatory domains are enriched for fetal-specific (p = 0.0014, OR = 1.52) and depleted of adult-specific regulatory activity (p = 3.04 × 10",Molecular psychiatry,2022,Adult; Humans; Schizophrenia; Gene Expression Regulation; Prefrontal Cortex; Chromatin; Multifactorial Inheritance; Genetic Predisposition to Disease,False,7
Estonian Biobank,35680855,Comprehensive genome-wide association study of different forms of hernia identifies more than 80 associated loci.,"Hernias are characterized by protrusion of an organ or tissue through its surrounding cavity and often require surgical repair. In this study we identify 65,492 cases for five hernia types in the UK Biobank and perform genome-wide association study scans for these five types and two combined groups. Our results show associated variants in all scans. Inguinal hernia has the most associations and we conduct a follow-up study with 23,803 additional cases from four study groups giving 84 independently associated variants. Identified variants from all scans are collapsed into 81 independent loci. Further testing shows that 26 loci are associated with more than one hernia type, suggesting substantial overlap between the underlying genetic mechanisms. Pathway analyses identify several genes with a strong link to collagen and/or elastin (ADAMTS6, ADAMTS16, ADAMTSL3, LOX, ELN) in the vicinity of associated loci for inguinal hernia, which substantiates an essential role of connective tissue morphology.",Nature communications,2022,"Collagen; Follow-Up Studies; Genome-Wide Association Study; Hernia, Inguinal; Humans",False,7

Here, we perform a large-scale hip fracture genome-wide association study meta-analysis and Mendelian randomization study using five cohorts from European biobanks. The results show that five genetic signals associate with hip fractures. Among these, one signal associates with falls, but not with bone mineral density (BMD), while four signals are in loci known to be involved in bone biology. Mendelian randomization analyses demonstrate a strong causal effect of decreased femoral neck BMD and moderate causal effects of Alzheimer's disease and having ever smoked regularly on risk of hip fractures. The substantial causal effect of decreased femoral neck BMD on hip fractures in both young and old subjects and in both men and women supports the use of change in femoral neck BMD as a surrogate outcome for hip fractures in clinical trials.",Cell reports.

Estonian Biobank,35031345,Beyond BMI: Personality traits' associations with adiposity and metabolic rate.,"Various personality traits are known to correlate with body mass index (BMI). However, this index of adiposity conflates fat mass with lean body mass and may therefore lead to biased estimates of correlations. Yet, rarely have studies looked beyond BMI to understand how adiposity and other physiological characteristics relate to these psychological traits. Using previously validated formulas, we calculated an improved measure of adiposity (relative fat mass, RFM), as well as basal metabolic rate (BMR); explored their associations with various personality traits; and assessed how personality traits' associations with RFM differ from their associations with BMI. In a subsample of the Estonian Biobank (N = 3535), we compared how the five domains and 30 facets of NEO Personality Inventory-3 correlated with RFM, BMI, and BMR. Various traits, notably Openness to Experience and its facets, were associated with RFM above and beyond BMI; these traits may relate to lower adiposity through eating habits. Assertiveness, a facet of Extraversion, correlated more strongly with BMI than with RFM and also correlated with BMR. These correlations mirror associations of metabolic rate with conceptually similar traits in non-human animals and are consistent with Assertiveness being based on biological processes. Finally, BMI-personality trait correlations appeared to conflate personality traits' associations with fat mass and lean mass; the use of BMI as an indicator of adiposity can lead to both attenuated and inflated estimates of personality trait-adiposity associations.",Physiology & behavior,2022,Adiposity; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Humans; Obesity; Personality; Personality Inventory,False,6

Estonian Biobank,34784307,Comprehensive biomarker profiling of hypertension in 36 985 Finnish individuals.,"Previous studies on the association between metabolic biomarkers and hypertension have been limited by small sample sizes, low number of studied biomarkers, and cross-sectional study design. In the largest study to date, we assess the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between high-abundance serum biomarkers and blood pressure (BP). We studied cross-sectional (N = 36 985; age 50.5 ± 14.2; 53.1% women) and longitudinal (N = 4197; age 49.4 ± 11.8, 55.3% women) population samples of Finnish individuals. We included 53 serum biomarkers and other detailed lipoprotein subclass measures in our analyses. We studied the associations between serum biomarkers and BP using both conventional statistical methods and a machine learning algorithm (gradient boosting) while adjusting for clinical risk factors. Fifty-one of 53 serum biomarkers were cross-sectionally related to BP (adjusted P < 0.05 for all). Conventional linear regression modeling demonstrated that LDL cholesterol, remnant cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and acetate were positively, and HDL particle size was negatively, associated with SBP change over time (adjusted P < 0.05 for all). Adding serum biomarkers (cross-sectional root-mean-square error: 16.27 mmHg; longitudinal: 17.61 mmHg) in the model with clinical measures (cross-sectional: 16.70 mmHg; longitudinal 18.52 mmHg) improved the machine learning model fit. Glucose, albumin, triglycerides in LDL, glycerol, VLDL particle size, and acetoacetate had the highest importance scores in models related to current or future BP. Our results suggest that serum lipids, and particularly LDL-derived and VLDL-derived cholesterol measures, and glucose metabolism abnormalities are associated with hypertension onset.

Estonian Biobank,33878186,Cis-epistasis at the LPA locus and risk of cardiovascular diseases.,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) has a strong genetic predisposition. However, despite substantial discoveries made by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a large proportion of heritability awaits identification. Non-additive genetic effects might be responsible for part of the unaccounted genetic variance. Here, we attempted a proof-of-concept study to identify non-additive genetic effects, namely epistatic interactions, associated with CAD. We tested for epistatic interactions in 10 CAD case-control studies and UK Biobank with focus on 8068 SNPs at 56 loci with known associations with CAD risk. We identified a SNP pair located in cis at the LPA locus, rs1800769 and rs9458001, to be jointly associated with risk for CAD [odds ratio (OR) = 1.37, P = 1.07 × 10-11], peripheral arterial disease (OR = 1.22, P = 2.32 × 10-4), aortic stenosis (OR = 1.47, P = 6.95 × 10-7), hepatic lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) transcript levels (beta = 0.39, P = 1.41 × 10-8), and Lp(a) serum levels (beta = 0.58, P = 8.7 × 10-32), while individual SNPs displayed no association. Further exploration of the LPA locus revealed a strong dependency of these associations on a rare variant, rs140570886, that was previously associated with Lp(a) levels. We confirmed increased CAD risk for heterozygous (relative OR = 1.46, P = 9.97 × 10-32) and individuals homozygous for the minor allele (relative OR = 1.77, P = 0.09) of rs140570886. Using forward model selection, we also show that epistatic interactions between rs140570886, rs9458001, and rs1800769 modulate the effects of the rs140570886 risk allele. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a large-scale knowledge-based epistasis scan and provide rare evidence of an epistatic interaction in a complex human disease. We were directed to a variant (rs140570886) influencing risk through additive genetic as well as epistatic effects.

Functional characterization of such adaptive variants can shed light on disease biology and past adaptations. This popular idea, however, was difficult to test due to challenges in pinpointing adaptive mutations in selection footprints. In this study, using a local-tree-based approach, we show that 28% of risk loci (153/535) in 21 inflammatory disorders bear footprints of moderate and weak selection, and part of them are population specific. Weak selection footprints allow partial fine-mapping, and we show that in 19% (29/153) of the risk loci under selection, candidate disease variants are hitchhikers, and only in 39% of cases they are likely selection targets. We predict function for a subset of these selected SNPs and highlight examples of antagonistic pleiotropy.

While some residual outcome variability may be attributable to genetic factors, published candidate gene association studies have often been underpowered and subject to publication bias. We performed the first genome- and transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS, TWAS) of genetic effects on outcome in TBI. The study population consisted of 5268 patients from prospective European and US studies, who attended hospital within 24 h of TBI, and satisfied local protocols for computed tomography. The estimated heritability of TBI outcome was 0·26. GWAS revealed no genetic variants with genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10 While multiple novel loci reached less stringent thresholds, none achieved genome-wide significance. The overall heritability estimate, however, is consistent with the hypothesis that common genetic variation substantially contributes to inter-individual variability in TBI outcome.

Here, introgressed variants from archaic humans such as Neandertals can serve as an intriguing research paradigm. We compared the number of associations for Neandertal variants to the number of associations of frequency-matched non-archaic variants with regard to human CNS disorders (neurological and psychiatric), nervous system drug prescriptions (as a proxy for disease), and related, non-disease phenotypes in the UK biobank (UKBB). While no enrichment for Neandertal genetic variants were observed in the UKBB for psychiatric or neurological disease categories, we found significant associations with certain behavioral phenotypes including pain, chronotype/sleep, smoking and alcohol consumption. In some instances, the enrichment signal was driven by Neandertal variants that represented the strongest association genome-wide. SNPs within a Neandertal haplotype that was associated with smoking in the UKBB could be replicated in four independent genomics datasets.Our data suggest that evolutionary processes in recent human evolution like admixture with Neandertals significantly contribute to behavioral phenotypes but not psychiatric and neurological diseases.

Yet longitudinal metabolomics data are rare and long gaps between visits can introduce biases that mask true trends. We introduce new ways to process quantitative time-series population data and elucidate metabolic ageing trends in two large cohorts. Eligible participants included 1672 individuals from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study and 3117 from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. Up to three time points (ages 24-49 years) were analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics and clinical biochemistry (236 measures). Temporal trends were quantified as median change per decade. Sample quality was verified by consistency of shared biomarkers between metabolomics and clinical assays. Batch effects between visits were mitigated by a new algorithm introduced in this report. The results below satisfy multiple testing threshold of P < 0.0006.

Estonian Biobank,34791244,Investigation of the causal relationships between human IgG N-glycosylation and 12 common diseases associated with changes in the IgG N-glycome.,"Changes in the N-glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) are often observed in pathological states, such as autoimmune, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular diseases and some types of cancer. However, in most cases, it is not clear if the disease onset causes these changes, or if the changes in IgG N-glycosylation are among the risk factors for the diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the casual relationships between IgG N-glycosylation traits and 12 diseases, in which the alterations of IgG N-glycome were previously reported, using two sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. We have performed two sample MR using publicly available summary statistics of genome-wide association studies of IgG N-glycosylation and disease risks. Our results indicate positive causal effect of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on the abundance of N-glycans with bisecting N-acetylglucosamine in the total IgG N-glycome. Therefore, we suggest regarding this IgG glycosylation trait as a biomarker of SLE. We also emphasize the need for more powerful GWAS studies of IgG N-glycosylation to further elucidate the causal effect of IgG N-glycome on the diseases.",Human molecular genetics,2022,"Genome-Wide Association Study; Glycosylation; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Polysaccharides",False,3
Estonian Biobank,37285119,Genetic Risk Factors Associated With Preeclampsia and Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy.,"A genetic contribution to preeclampsia susceptibility has been established but is still incompletely understood. To disentangle the underlying genetic architecture of preeclampsia and preeclampsia or other maternal hypertension during pregnancy with a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This GWAS included meta-analyses in maternal preeclampsia and a combination phenotype encompassing maternal preeclampsia and preeclampsia or other maternal hypertensive disorders. Two overlapping phenotype groups were selected for examination, namely, preeclampsia and preeclampsia or other maternal hypertension during pregnancy. Data from the Finnish Genetics of Pre-eclampsia Consortium (FINNPEC, 1990-2011), Finnish FinnGen project (1964-2019), Estonian Biobank (1997-2019), and the previously published InterPregGen consortium GWAS were combined. Individuals with preeclampsia or other maternal hypertension during pregnancy and control individuals were selected from the cohorts based on relevant International Classification of Diseases codes. Data were analyzed from July 2020 to February 2023. The association of a genome-wide set of genetic variants and clinical risk factors was analyzed for the 2 phenotypes. A total of 16 743 women with prior preeclampsia and 15 200 with preeclampsia or other maternal hypertension during pregnancy were obtained from FINNPEC, FinnGen, Estonian Biobank, and the InterPregGen consortium study (respective mean [SD] ages at diagnosis: 30.3 [5.5], 28.7 [5.6], 29.7 [7.0], and 28 [not available] years). The analysis found 19 genome-wide significant associations, 13 of which were novel. Seven of the novel loci harbor genes previously associated with blood pressure traits (NPPA, NPR3, PLCE1, TNS2, FURIN, RGL3, and PREX1). In line with this, the 2 study phenotypes showed genetic correlation with blood pressure traits. In addition, novel risk loci were identified in the proximity of genes involved in the development of placenta (PGR, TRPC6, ACTN4, and PZP), remodeling of uterine spiral arteries (NPPA, NPPB, NPR3, and ACTN4), kidney function (PLCE1, TNS2, ACTN4, and TRPC6), and maintenance of proteostasis in pregnancy serum (PZP). The findings indicate that genes related to blood pressure traits are associated with preeclampsia, but many of these genes have additional pleiotropic effects on cardiometabolic, endothelial, and placental function. Furthermore, several of the associated loci have no known connection with cardiovascular disease but instead harbor genes contributing to maintenance of successful pregnancy, with dysfunctions leading to preeclampsialike symptoms.",JAMA cardiology,2023,"Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Pre-Eclampsia; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Genome-Wide Association Study; TRPC6 Cation Channel; Placenta; Risk Factors",False,8
Estonian Biobank,37632466,Global Effect of Modifiable Risk Factors on Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality.,"Five modifiable risk factors are associated with cardiovascular disease and death from any cause. Studies using individual-level data to evaluate the regional and sex-specific prevalence of the risk factors and their effect on these outcomes are lacking. We pooled and harmonized individual-level data from 112 cohort studies conducted in 34 countries and 8 geographic regions participating in the Global Cardiovascular Risk Consortium. We examined associations between the risk factors (body-mass index, systolic blood pressure, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, current smoking, and diabetes) and incident cardiovascular disease and death from any cause using Cox regression analyses, stratified according to geographic region, age, and sex. Population-attributable fractions were estimated for the 10-year incidence of cardiovascular disease and 10-year all-cause mortality. Among 1,518,028 participants (54.1% of whom were women) with a median age of 54.4 years, regional variations in the prevalence of the five modifiable risk factors were noted. Incident cardiovascular disease occurred in 80,596 participants during a median follow-up of 7.3 years (maximum, 47.3), and 177,369 participants died during a median follow-up of 8.7 years (maximum, 47.6). For all five risk factors combined, the aggregate global population-attributable fraction of the 10-year incidence of cardiovascular disease was 57.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52.4 to 62.1) among women and 52.6% (95% CI, 49.0 to 56.1) among men, and the corresponding values for 10-year all-cause mortality were 22.2% (95% CI, 16.8 to 27.5) and 19.1% (95% CI, 14.6 to 23.6). Harmonized individual-level data from a global cohort showed that 57.2% and 52.6% of cases of incident cardiovascular disease among women and men, respectively, and 22.2% and 19.1% of deaths from any cause among women and men, respectively, may be attributable to five modifiable risk factors.

Estonian Biobank,37563310,Genetics of circulating inflammatory proteins identifies drivers of immune-mediated disease risk and therapeutic targets.,"Circulating proteins have important functions in inflammation and a broad range of diseases. To identify genetic influences on inflammation-related proteins, we conducted a genome-wide protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) study of 91 plasma proteins measured using the Olink Target platform in 14,824 participants. We identified 180 pQTLs (59 cis, 121 trans). Integration of pQTL data with eQTL and disease genome-wide association studies provided insight into pathogenesis, implicating lymphotoxin-α in multiple sclerosis. Using Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess causality in disease etiology, we identified both shared and distinct effects of specific proteins across immune-mediated diseases, including directionally discordant effects of CD40 on risk of rheumatoid arthritis versus multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease.

Our objective was to identify blood proteins linked with AP by combining genome-wide association meta-analysis and proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. We performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis totalling 10,630 patients with AP and 844,679 controls and a series of inverse-variance weighted MR analyses using cis-acting variants on 4719 blood proteins from the deCODE study (N = 35,559) and 4979 blood proteins from the Fenland study (N = 10,708).

In the current study we conducted the largest AD GWAS to date (discovery N = 1,086,394, replication N = 3,604,027), combining previously reported cohorts with additional available data. We identified 81 loci (29 novel) in the European-only analysis (which all replicated in a separate European analysis) and 10 additional loci in the multi-ancestry analysis (3 novel). Eight variants from the multi-ancestry analysis replicated in at least one of the populations tested (European, Latino or African), while two may be specific to individuals of Japanese ancestry.

Whether these relations underlie causal effects in humans remains to be established. We aimed to determine whether the gut microbiota influences cardiometabolic traits as well as the risk of chronic diseases and human longevity using a comprehensive 2-Sample Mendelian randomization approach. We included as exposures 10 gut-associated metabolites and pathways and 57 microbial taxa abundance. We included as outcomes nine cardiometabolic traits (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, estimated glomerular filtration rate, body mass index [BMI]), eight chronic diseases previously linked with the gut microbiota in observational studies (Alzheimer's disease, depression, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease), as well as parental lifespan and longevity. We found 7 associations with evidence of causality before and after sensitivity analyses, but not after multiple testing correction (1198 tests). Most effect sizes (4/7) were small. The two largest exposure-outcome effects were markedly attenuated towards the null upon inclusion of BMI or alcohol intake frequency in multivariable MR analyses. While finding robust genetic instruments for microbiota features is challenging hence potentially inflating type 2 errors, these results do not support a large causal impact of human gut microbita features on cardiometabolic traits, chronic diseases or longevity. These results also suggest that the previously documented associations between gut microbiota and human health outcomes may not always underly causal relations.",Journal of translational medicine,2023,"Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Longevity; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Coronary Artery Disease; Body Mass Index; Chronic Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genome-Wide Association Study",False,7
Estonian Biobank,36800955,The hepato-ovarian axis: genetic evidence for a causal association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Recent studies found associations between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but the causal nature of this association is still uncertain. We performed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to test for the causal association between NAFLD and PCOS using data from a large-scale biopsy-confirmed NAFLD genome-wide association study (GWAS) (1483 cases and 17,781 controls) and PCOS GWAS (10,074 cases and 103,164 controls) in European ancestries. Data from glycemic-related traits GWAS (in up to 200,622 individuals) and sex hormones GWAS (in 189,473 women) in the UK Biobank (UKB) were used in the MR mediation analysis to assess potential mediating roles of these molecules in the causal pathway between NAFLD and PCOS. Replication analysis was conducted using two independent datasets from NAFLD and PCOS GWASs in the UKB and a meta-analysis of data from FinnGen and the Estonian Biobank, respectively. A linkage disequilibrium score regression was conducted to assess genetic correlations between NAFLD, PCOS, glycemic-related traits, and sex hormones using full summary statistics. Individuals with higher genetic liability to NAFLD were more likely to develop PCOS (OR per one-unit log odds increase in NAFLD: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.18; P = 0.013). Indirect causal effects of NAFLD on PCOS via fasting insulin only (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03; P = 0.004) and further a suggestive indirect causal effect via fasting insulin in concert with androgen levels were revealed in MR mediation analyses. However, the conditional F statistics of NAFLD and fasting insulin were less than 10, suggesting likely weak instrument bias in the MVMR and MR mediation analyses. Our study suggests that genetically predicted NAFLD was associated with a higher risk of developing PCOS but less evidence for vice versa.

Estonian Biobank,37079300,Overlap of Genetic Loci for Central Serous Chorioretinopathy With Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a serous maculopathy of unknown etiology. Two of 3 previously reported CSC genetic risk loci are also associated with AMD. Improved understanding of CSC genetics may broaden our understanding of this genetic overlap and unveil mechanisms in both diseases. To identify novel genetic risk factors for CSC and compare genetic risk factors for CSC and AMD. Using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth (ICD-9) and Tenth (ICD-10) Revision code-based inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients with CSC and controls were identified in both the FinnGen study and the Estonian Biobank (EstBB). Also included in a meta-analysis were previously reported patients with chronic CSC and controls. Data were analyzed from March 1 to September 31, 2022. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were performed in the biobank-based cohorts followed by a meta-analysis of all cohorts. The expression of genes prioritized by the polygenic priority score and nearest-gene methods were assessed in cultured choroidal endothelial cells and public ocular single-cell RNA sequencing data sets. The predictive utility of polygenic scores (PGSs) for CSC and AMD were evaluated in the FinnGen study. A total of 1176 patients with CSC and 526 787 controls (312 162 female [59.3%]) were included in this analysis: 552 patients with CSC and 343 461 controls were identified in the FinnGen study, 103 patients with CSC and 178 573 controls were identified in the EstBB, and 521 patients with chronic CSC and 3577 controls were included in a meta-analysis. Two previously reported CSC risk loci were replicated (near CFH and GATA5) and 3 novel loci were identified (near CD34/46, NOTCH4, and PREX1). The CFH and NOTCH4 loci were associated with AMD but in the opposite direction. Prioritized genes showed increased expression in cultured choroidal endothelial cells compared with other genes in the loci (median [IQR] of log 2 [counts per million], 7.3 [0.6] vs 4.7 [3.7]; P = .004) and were differentially expressed in choroidal vascular endothelial cells in single-cell RNA sequencing data (mean [SD] fold change, 2.05 [0.38] compared with other cell types; P < 7.1 × 10-20). A PGS for AMD was predictive of reduced CSC risk (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70-0.83 per +1 SD in AMD-PGS; P = 7.4 × 10-10). This association may have been mediated by loci containing complement genes. In this 3-cohort genetic association study, 5 genetic risk loci for CSC were identified, highlighting a likely role for genes involved in choroidal vascular function and complement regulation.

A meta-analysis of preterm delivery (18,797 cases, 260,246 controls) revealed six associated loci and large genetic similarities with gestational duration. Analysis of the parental transmitted and nontransmitted alleles (n = 136,833) shows that 15 of the gestational duration genetic variants act through the maternal genome, whereas 7 act both through the maternal and fetal genomes and 2 act only via the fetal genome. Finally, the maternal effects on gestational duration show signs of antagonistic pleiotropy with the fetal effects on birth weight: maternal alleles that increase gestational duration have negative fetal effects on birth weight.

We identified two novel genome-wide significant associations with ectopic pregnancy, highlighting MUC1 (mucin 1) as the most plausible affected gene. Ectopic pregnancy is an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite being a common early pregnancy complication, the genetic predisposition to this condition remains understudied and no large scale genetic studies have been performed so far. A GWAS meta-analysis including 7070 women with ectopic pregnancy and 248 810 controls from Estonian Biobank and the FinnGen study. We identified ectopic pregnancy cases from national registers by ICD (International Classification of Disease) codes (ICD-10 O00), and all remaining women were considered controls. We carried out standard GWAS meta-analysis and additionally annotated GWAS signals, analysed co-localization with quantitative trait loci, estimated genetic correlations and identified associated phenotypes to characterize the genetic signals, as well as to analyse the genetic and phenotypic relationships with the condition. We identified two genome-wide significant loci on chromosomes 1 (rs4971091, P = 5.32×10-9) and 10 (rs11598956, P = 2.41×10-8) potentially associated with ectopic pregnancy. Follow-up analyses propose MUC1, which codes for an epithelial glycoprotein with an important role in barrier function, as the most likely candidate gene for the association on chromosome 1. We also characterize the phenotypic and genetic correlations with other phenotypes, identifying a genetic correlation with smoking and diseases of the (genito)urinary and gastrointestinal system, and phenotypic correlations with various reproductive health diagnoses, reflecting the previously known epidemiological associations. The GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics are available from the GWAS Catalogue (GCST90272883). The main limitation is that the findings are based on European-based ancestry populations, with limited data on other populations, and we only captured maternal genomes. Additionally, further larger meta-analysis or independent studies are needed to validate these findings. This study encourages the use of large-scale genetic datasets to unravel genetic factors linked to ectopic pregnancy, which is difficult to study in experimental settings. Increased sample size might bring additional genetic factors associating with ectopic pregnancy and inform its heritability. Altogether, our results provide more insight into the biology of ectopic pregnancy and, accordingly, the biological processes governing embryo implantation.

Despite widely acknowledged need for biomarkers in diagnosis of AMI, a broad systematic review on all studied biomarkers in different types of AMI is currently lacking. The aim of this study was to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of all potential biomarkers of AMI studied in humans. A systematic literature search in PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus was conducted in December 2022. Studies assessing potential biomarkers of AMI in (at least 10) adult patients and reporting their diagnostic accuracy were included. Meta-analyses of biomarkers' sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were conducted. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, and the study quality was assessed with the QUADAS-2 tool. Seventy-five studies including a total of 9914 patients assessed 18 different biomarkers in serum/plasma and one in urine (each reported in at least two studies), which were included in meta-analyses. None of the biomarkers reached a conclusive level for accurate prediction. The best predictive value overall (all studies with any type and stage of AMI pooled) was observed for Ischaemia-modified albumin (2 studies, sensitivity 94.7 and specificity 90.5), interleukin-6 (n = 4, 96.3 and 82.6), procalcitonin (n = 6, 80.1 and 86.7), and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) measured in serum (n = 16, 73.9 and 90.5) or in urine (n = 4, 87.9 and 78.9). In assessment of transmural mesenteric ischaemia, urinary I-FABP (n = 2, 92.3 and 85.2) and D-dimer (n = 3, 87.6 and 83.6) showed moderate predictive value. Overall risk of bias was high, mainly because of selected study populations and unclear timings of the biomarker measurements after onset of symptoms. Combinations of biomarkers were rarely studied, not allowing meta-analyses. None of the studied biomarkers had sufficient sensitivity and specificity to diagnose AMI, although some biomarkers showed moderate predictive accuracy. Future studies should focus on timing of measurements of biomarkers, distinguishing between early stage and transmural necrosis, and between different types of AMI.

Here, we use electronic health record (EHR) data from the Estonian Biobank (EstBB) to investigate the role of lifetime depression in AHM adherence and persistence. We also explore the relationship between antidepressant initiation and intraindividual change in AHM adherence among hypertension (HTN) patients with newly diagnosed depression. Diagnosis and pharmacy refill data were obtained from the National Health Insurance database. Adherence and persistence to AHMs were determined for hypertension (HTN) patients initiating treatment between 2009 and 2017 with a three-year follow-up period. Multivariable regression was used to explore the associations between depression and AHM adherence or persistence, adjusting for sociodemographic, genetic, and health-related factors. A linear mixed-effects model was used to estimate the effect of antidepressant treatment initiation on antihypertensive medication adherence, adjusting for age and sex. We identified 20,724 individuals with newly diagnosed HTN (6294 depression cases and 14,430 controls). Depression was associated with 6% lower probability of AHM adherence (OR = 0.943, 95%CI = 0.909-0.979) and 12% lower odds of AHM persistence (OR = 0.876, 95%CI = 0.821-0.936).

AHM adherence increased 8% six months after initiating antidepressant therapy (N = 132; β = 0.078; 95%CI = 0.025-0.131). Based on the EHR data on EstBB participants, depression is associated with lower AHM adherence and persistence.

Estonian Biobank,36864135,Genome-wide analysis identifies genetic effects on reproductive success and ongoing natural selection at the FADS locus.,"Identifying genetic determinants of reproductive success may highlight mechanisms underlying fertility and identify alleles under present-day selection. Using data in 785,604 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 43 genomic loci associated with either number of children ever born (NEB) or childlessness. These loci span diverse aspects of reproductive biology, including puberty timing, age at first birth, sex hormone regulation, endometriosis and age at menopause. Missense variants in ARHGAP27 were associated with higher NEB but shorter reproductive lifespan, suggesting a trade-off at this locus between reproductive ageing and intensity. Other genes implicated by coding variants include PIK3IP1, ZFP82 and LRP4, and our results suggest a new role for the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) in reproductive biology. As NEB is one component of evolutionary fitness, our identified associations indicate loci under present-day natural selection. Integration with data from historical selection scans highlighted an allele in the FADS1/2 gene locus that has been under selection for thousands of years and remains so today. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that a broad range of biological mechanisms contribute to reproductive success.",Nature human behaviour,2023,"Child; Female; Humans; Aging; Fertility; Menopause; Reproduction; Selection, Genetic",False,1
Estonian Biobank,36966315,Common clinical blood and urine biomarkers for ischemic stroke: an Estonian Electronic Health Records database study.,"Ischemic stroke (IS) is a major health risk without generally usable effective measures of primary prevention. Early warning signals that are easy to detect and widely available can save lives. Estonia has one nation-wide Electronic Health Record (EHR) database for the storage of medical information of patients from hospitals and primary care providers. We extracted structured and unstructured data from the EHRs of participants of the Estonian Biobank (EstBB) and evaluated different formats of input data to understand how this continuously growing dataset should be prepared for best prediction. The utility of the EHR database for finding blood- and urine-based biomarkers for IS was demonstrated by applying different analytical and machine learning (ML) methods. Several early trends in common clinical laboratory parameter changes (set of red blood indices, lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio, etc.) were established for IS prediction. The developed ML models predicted the future occurrence of IS with very high accuracy and Random Forests was proved as the most applicable method to EHR data. We conclude that the EHR database and the risk factors uncovered are valuable resources in screening the population for risk of IS as well as constructing disease risk scores and refining prediction models for IS by ML.",European journal of medical research,2023,Humans; Electronic Health Records; Ischemic Stroke; Estonia; Risk Factors; Biomarkers,False,9
Estonian Biobank,35987817,Genetic and modifiable risk factors combine multiplicatively in common disease.,"The joint contribution of genetic and environmental exposures to noncommunicable diseases is not well characterized. We modeled the cumulative effects of common risk alleles and their prevalence variations with classical risk factors. We analyzed mathematically and statistically numbers and effect sizes of established risk alleles for coronary artery disease (CAD) and other conditions. In UK Biobank, risk alleles counts in the lowest (175.4) and highest decile (205.7) of the distribution differed by only 16.9%, which nevertheless increased CAD prevalence 3.4-fold (p < 0.01). Irrespective of the affected gene, a single risk allele multiplied the effects of all others carried by a person, resulting in a 2.9-fold stronger effect size in the top versus the bottom decile (p < 0.01) and an exponential increase in risk (R > 0.94). Classical risk factors shifted effect sizes to the steep upslope of the logarithmic function linking risk allele numbers with CAD prevalence. Similar phenomena were observed in the Estonian Biobank and for risk alleles affecting diabetes mellitus, breast and prostate cancer. Alleles predisposing to common diseases can be carried safely in large numbers, but few additional ones lead to sharp risk increments. Here, we describe exponential functions by which risk alleles combine interchangeably but multiplicatively with each other and with modifiable risk factors to affect prevalence. Our data suggest that the biological systems underlying these diseases are modulated by hundreds of genes but become only fragile when a narrow window of total risk, irrespective of its genetic or environmental origins, has been passed.",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2023,"Humans; Coronary Artery Disease; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Alleles; United Kingdom; Gene-Environment Interaction; Prevalence",False,8

Estonian Biobank,36989840,Genome-wide association study of obstructive sleep apnoea in the Million Veteran Program uncovers genetic heterogeneity by sex.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are limited due to the underdiagnosis of OSA, leading to misclassification of OSA, which consequently reduces statistical power. We performed a GWAS of OSA in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system, where OSA prevalence is close to its true population prevalence. We performed GWAS of 568,576 MVP participants, stratified by biological sex and by harmonized race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry (HARE) groups of White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian individuals. We considered both BMI adjusted (BMI-adj) and unadjusted (BMI-unadj) models. We replicated associations in independent datasets, and analysed the heterogeneity of OSA genetic associations across HARE and sex groups. We finally performed a larger meta-analysis GWAS of MVP, FinnGen, and the MGB Biobank, totalling 916,696 individuals. MVP participants are 91% male. OSA prevalence is 21%. In MVP there were 18 and 6 genome-wide significant loci in BMI-unadj and BMI-adj analyses, respectively, corresponding to 21 association regions. Of these, 17 were not previously reported in association with OSA, and 13 replicated in FinnGen (False Discovery Rate p-value < 0.05). There were widespread significant differences in genetic effects between men and women, but less so across HARE groups. Meta-analysis of MVP, FinnGen, and MGB biobank revealed 17 additional, previously unreported, genome-wide significant regions. Sex differences in genetic associations with OSA are widespread, likely associated with multiple OSA risk factors. OSA shares genetic underpinnings with several sleep phenotypes, suggesting shared aetiology and causal pathways.

Estonian Biobank,37853040,GeneToCN: an alignment-free method for gene copy number estimation directly from next-generation sequencing reads.,"Genomes exhibit large regions with segmental copy number variation, many of which include entire genes and are multiallelic. We have developed a computational method GeneToCN that counts the frequencies of gene-specific k-mers in FASTQ files and uses this information to infer copy number of the gene. We validated the copy number predictions for amylase genes (AMY1, AMY2A, AMY2B) using experimental data from digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) on 39 individuals and observed a strong correlation (R = 0.99) between GeneToCN predictions and experimentally determined copy numbers. An additional validation on FCGR3 genes showed a higher concordance for FCGR3A compared to two other methods, but reduced accuracy for FCGR3B. We further tested the method on three different genomic regions (SMN, NPY4R, and LPA Kringle IV-2 domain). Predicted copy number distributions of these genes in a set of 500 individuals from the Estonian Biobank were in good agreement with the previously published studies. In addition, we investigated the possibility to use GeneToCN on sequencing data generated by different technologies by comparing copy number predictions from Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore data of the same sample. Despite the differences in variability of k-mer frequencies, all three sequencing technologies give similar predictions with GeneToCN.",Scientific reports,2023,Humans; DNA Copy Number Variations; Gene Dosage; Genome; Polymerase Chain Reaction; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing,False,7
Estonian Biobank,37568101,Lifeday coverage of oral anticoagulants and one-year relative survival in patients with atrial fibrillation: a population-based study in Estonia.,"Routine oral anticoagulation (OAC) is recommended for almost all high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation, yet registries show that OACs are still underused. Our aim was to study the lifeday coverage (LDC) of OAC prescriptions and its relationship with one-year mortality rates of AF patients aged ≥ 65 in Estonia for the years 2019 and 2020. Medical data for AF patients aged ≥ 65 years from 2018 and alive as of 01.01.2019 (cohort I) and new AF documentation from 2019 and alive as of 01.01.2020 (cohort II) was obtained from the Health Insurance Fund's electronic database. The data was linked to the nationwide Estonian Medical Prescription Centre's database of prescribed OACs. For LDC analysis, daily doses of guideline-recommended OACs were used. The patients were categorized into three LDC groups: 0%, 1-79%, and ≥ 80%. The data was linked to the Estonian Causes of Death Registry to establish the date of death and mortality rate for the whole Estonian population aged ≥ 65. There were 34,018 patients in cohort I and 9,175 patients with new AF documentation (cohort II), previously not included in cohort I. Of the patients, 77.7% and 68.6% had at least one prescription of OAC in cohorts I and II respectively. 57.4% in cohort I and 44.5% in cohort II had an LDC of ≥ 80%. The relative survival estimates at 1 year for LDC lifeday coverage groups 0%, 1-79%, and ≥ 80% were 91.2%, 98.2%, and 98.5% (cohort I), and 91.9%, 95.2%, and 97.6% (cohort II), respectively. Despite clear indications for OAC use, LDC is still insufficient and anticoagulation is underused for stroke prevention in Estonia.

Cross-sectional study using self-administered questionnaire and self-collected vaginal swabs for detection of HPV infection. Estonian Biobank database. Stratified random sample of women aged 30-33, 57-60 and 67-70 years living in one of the three largest counties in Estonia. Of 3065 women approached, 1347 (43.9%) returned questionnaires and specimens for HPV DNA detection. HPV prevalence and fully adjusted ORs with 95% CIs for risk factors. HPV prevalence was highest among women aged 30-33 years (18.7%; 95% CI 15.8 to 21.9) followed by those aged 67-70 years (16.7%; 95% CI 12.4 to 22.0) and 57-60 years (10.2%; 95% CI 7.8 to 13.3). HPV16 and HPV56 were the most common among women aged 30-33 years (both 4.0%; 95% CI 2.7 to 5.9), and HPV68 was the most common among women aged 57-60 years (2.8%; 95% CI 1.5 to 4.7) and 67-70 years (6.4%; 95% CI 3.6 to 10.4). Vaccination with nonavalent vaccine would have halved the carcinogenic HPV prevalence among women aged 30-33 years. The odds of infection with carcinogenic HPV were higher among women with six or more sexual partners among younger (OR 2.99; 95% CI 1.54 to 5.81) and older (OR 3.80; 95% CI 1.25 to 11.55) women and lower (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.72) among younger married women. This study demonstrated U-shaped age-specific genotype profile of carcinogenic HPV prevalence, indicating that public health providers should focus on developing exit strategies for the cervical cancer screening programme in Estonia with a possible extension of HPV testing beyond the current screening age of 65 years.

Estonian Biobank,36560850,Long-range regulatory effects of Neandertal DNA in modern humans.,"The admixture between modern humans and Neandertals has resulted in ∼2% of the genomes of present-day non-Africans being composed of Neandertal DNA. Introgressed Neandertal DNA has been demonstrated to significantly affect the transcriptomic landscape in people today and via this molecular mechanism influence phenotype variation as well. However, little is known about how much of that regulatory impact is mediated through long-range regulatory effects that have been shown to explain ∼20% of expression variation. Here we identified 60 transcription factors (TFs) with their top cis-eQTL SNP in GTEx being of Neandertal ancestry and predicted long-range Neandertal DNA-induced regulatory effects by screening for the predicted target genes of those TFs. We show that the TFs form a significantly connected protein-protein interaction network. Among them are JUN and PRDM5, two brain-expressed TFs that have their predicted target genes enriched in regions devoid of Neandertal DNA. Archaic cis-eQTLs for the 60 TFs include multiple candidates for local adaptation, some of which show significant allele frequency increases over the last ∼10,000 years. A large proportion of the cis-eQTL-associated archaic SNPs have additional associations with various immune traits, schizophrenia, blood cell type composition and anthropometric measures. Finally, we demonstrate that our results are consistent with those of Neandertal DNA-associated empirical trans-eQTLs. Our results suggest that Neandertal DNA significantly influences regulatory networks, that its regulatory reach goes beyond the 40% of genomic sequence it still covers in present-day non-Africans and that via the investigated mechanism Neandertal DNA influences the phenotypic variation in people today.",Genetics,2023,Humans; Animals; Neanderthals; Gene Frequency; Genome; Phenotype; DNA,False,7
Estonian Biobank,36823293,Longitudinal metabolomics of increasing body-mass index and waist-hip ratio reveals two dynamic patterns of obesity pandemic.,"This observational study dissects the complex temporal associations between body-mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR) and circulating metabolomics using a combination of longitudinal and cross-sectional population-based datasets and new systems epidemiology tools. Firstly, a data-driven subgrouping algorithm was employed to simplify high-dimensional metabolic profiling data into a single categorical variable: a self-organizing map (SOM) was created from 174 metabolic measures from cross-sectional surveys (FINRISK, n = 9708, ages 25-74) and a birth cohort (NFBC1966, n = 3117, age 31 at baseline, age 46 at follow-up) and an expert committee defined four subgroups of individuals based on visual inspection of the SOM. Secondly, the subgroups were compared regarding BMI and WHR trajectories in an independent longitudinal dataset: participants of the Young Finns Study (YFS, n = 1286, ages 24-39 at baseline, 10 years follow-up, three visits) were categorized into the four subgroups and subgroup-specific age-dependent trajectories of BMI, WHR and metabolic measures were modelled by linear regression. The four subgroups were characterised at age 39 by high BMI, WHR and dyslipidemia (designated TG-rich); low BMI, WHR and favourable lipids (TG-poor); low lipids in general (Low lipid) and high low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (High LDL-C). Trajectory modelling of the YFS dataset revealed a dynamic BMI divergence pattern: despite overlapping starting points at age 24, the subgroups diverged in BMI, fasting insulin (three-fold difference at age 49 between TG-rich and TG-poor) and insulin-associated measures such as triglyceride-cholesterol ratio. Trajectories also revealed a WHR progression pattern: despite different starting points at the age of 24 in WHR, LDL-C and cholesterol-associated measures, all subgroups exhibited similar rates of change in these measures, i.e. WHR progression was uniform regardless of the cross-sectional metabolic profile. Age-associated weight variation in adults between 24 and 49 manifests as temporal divergence in BMI and uniform progression of WHR across metabolic health strata.",International journal of obesity (2005),2023,"Adult; Humans; Young Adult; Middle Aged; Body Mass Index; Waist-Hip Ratio; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cholesterol, LDL; Pandemics; Obesity; Cholesterol; Insulin; Metabolomics; Risk Factors",False,4
Estonian Biobank,36929174,GWAS meta-analyses clarify the genetics of cervical phenotypes and inform risk stratification for cervical cancer.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified associations for cervical cancer, but the underlying mechanisms of cervical biology and pathology remain uncharacterised. Our GWAS meta-analyses fill this gap, as we characterise the genetic architecture of cervical phenotypes, including cervical ectropion, cervicitis, cervical dysplasia, as well as up to 9229 cases and 490 304 controls for cervical cancer from diverse ancestries. Leveraging the latest computational methods and gene expression data, we refine the association signals for cervical cancer and propose potential causal variants and genes at each locus. We prioritise PAX8/PAX8-AS1, LINC00339, CDC42, CLPTM1L, HLA-DRB1 and GSDMB as the most likely candidate genes for cervical cancer signals, providing insights into cervical cancer pathogenesis and supporting the involvement of reproductive tract development, immune response and cellular proliferation/apoptosis. We construct a genetic risk score (GRS) that is associated with cervical cancer [hazard ratios (HR) = 3.1 (1.7-5.6) for the top 15% vs lowest 15% of individuals], and with other HPV- and immune-system-related diagnoses in a phenome-wide association study analysis.

Estonian Biobank,36922633,Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies novel loci conferring risk of acne vulgaris.,"Acne vulgaris is a common chronic skin disorder presenting with comedones, cystic structures forming within the distal hair follicle, and in most cases additionally with inflammatory skin lesions on the face and upper torso. We performed a genome-wide association study and meta-analysis of data from 34,422 individuals with acne and 364,991 controls from three independent European-ancestry cohorts. We replicated 19 previously implicated genome-wide significant risk loci and identified four novel loci [11q12.2 (FADS2), 12q21.1 (LGR5), 17q25.3 (FASN), and 22q12.1 (ZNRF3-KREMEN1)], bringing the total number of reported acne risk loci to 50. Our meta-analysis results explain 9.4% of the phenotypic variance of acne. A polygenic model of acne risk variants showed that individuals in the top 5% of the risk percentiles had a 1.62-fold (95% CI 1.47-1.78) increased acne risk relative to individuals with average risk (20-80% on the polygenic risk score distribution). Our findings highlight the Wnt and MAPK pathways as key factors in the genetic predisposition to acne vulgaris, together with the effects of genetic variation on the structure and maintenance of the hair follicle and pilosebaceous unit.

Our aim was to describe current practice of GRV measurements and its association with clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. This was a secondary analysis of an international prospective observational cohort study (intestinal-specific organ function assessment). Eligibility criteria were defined as ≥1 GRV measurement during the 7-day study period. Data collection included GRV measurement practices, tube diameters and volumes, symptoms of GI dysfunction, and clinical outcomes. The primary aim was to describe current practices of GRV measurements, and the secondary aim was to test the association of high (>200 ml) vs. low GRV with symptoms of GI dysfunction and clinical outcomes using generalized linear regression and survival models. Two hundred fifty-eight patients with 2422 GRV measurements on 875 study days were analyzed. GRV was mainly measured via passive drainage twice daily using large diameter tubes. There was no significant association between tube size or measurement technique and high GRV. High GRV occurred in 34% of patients and was associated with other GI symptoms and with increased disease severity but not with 28-day or 90-day mortality, intensive care unit-free and ventilator-free days. There was substantial variability of GRV measurement techniques, but this had no impact on the amount of GRV. High GRV was not associated with mortality or ventilator-free days but may serve as a marker of GI dysfunction and disease severity.",JPEN.

Despite its well-known importance in thiopurine metabolism, the understanding of its endogenous role is lacking. In the present study, we aimed to gain insight into the molecular processes involving TPMT by applying a data fusion approach to analyze whole-genome expression data. The RNA profiling was done on whole blood samples from 1017 adult male and female donors to the Estonian biobank using Illumina HTv3 arrays. Our results suggest that TPMT is closely related to genes involved in oxidoreductive processes. The in vitro experiments on different cell models confirmed that TPMT influences redox capacity of the cell by altering S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) consumption and consequently glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Furthermore, by comparing gene networks of subgroups of individuals, we identified genes, which could have a role in regulating TPMT activity.

Estonian Biobank,36596879,Rare variant analyses across multiethnic cohorts identify novel genes for refractive error.,"Refractive error, measured here as mean spherical equivalent (SER), is a complex eye condition caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Individuals with strong positive or negative values of SER require spectacles or other approaches for vision correction. Common genetic risk factors have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but a great part of the refractive error heritability is still missing. Some of this heritability may be explained by rare variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] ≤ 0.01.). We performed multiple gene-based association tests of mean Spherical Equivalent with rare variants in exome array data from the Consortium for Refractive Error and Myopia (CREAM). The dataset consisted of over 27,000 total subjects from five cohorts of Indo-European and Eastern Asian ethnicity. We identified 129 unique genes associated with refractive error, many of which were replicated in multiple cohorts. Our best novel candidates included the retina expressed PDCD6IP, the circadian rhythm gene PER3, and P4HTM, which affects eye morphology. Future work will include functional studies and validation. Identification of genes contributing to refractive error and future understanding of their function may lead to better treatment and prevention of refractive errors, which themselves are important risk factors for various blinding conditions.",Communications biology,2023,Humans; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Myopia; Refractive Errors; White People; East Asian People,False,5
Estonian Biobank,37923823,HLA allele-calling using multi-ancestry whole-exome sequencing from the UK Biobank identifies 129 novel associations in 11 autoimmune diseases.,"The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6 is strongly associated with many immune-mediated and infection-related diseases. Due to its highly polymorphic nature and complex linkage disequilibrium patterns, traditional genetic association studies of single nucleotide polymorphisms do not perform well in this region. Instead, the field has adopted the assessment of the association of HLA alleles (i.e., entire HLA gene haplotypes) with disease. Often based on genotyping arrays, these association studies impute HLA alleles, decreasing accuracy and thus statistical power for rare alleles and in non-European ancestries. Here, we use whole-exome sequencing (WES) from 454,824 UK Biobank (UKB) participants to directly call HLA alleles using the HLA-HD algorithm. We show this method is more accurate than imputing HLA alleles and harness the improved statistical power to identify 360 associations for 11 auto-immune phenotypes (at least 129 likely novel), leading to better insights into the specific coding polymorphisms that underlie these diseases. We show that HLA alleles with synonymous variants, often overlooked in HLA studies, can significantly influence these phenotypes. Lastly, we show that HLA sequencing may improve polygenic risk scores accuracy across ancestries.

Estonian Biobank,36658689,Cross-sectionally Calculated Metabolic Aging Does Not Relate to Longitudinal Metabolic Changes-Support for Stratified Aging Models.,"Aging varies between individuals, with profound consequences for chronic diseases and longevity. One hypothesis to explain the diversity is a genetically regulated molecular clock that runs differently between individuals. Large human studies with long enough follow-up to test the hypothesis are rare due to practical challenges, but statistical models of aging are built as proxies for the molecular clock by comparing young and old individuals cross-sectionally. These models remain untested against longitudinal data. We applied novel methodology to test if cross-sectional modeling can distinguish slow vs accelerated aging in a human population. We trained a machine learning model to predict age from 153 clinical and cardiometabolic traits. The model was tested against longitudinal data from another cohort. The training data came from cross-sectional surveys of the Finnish population (n = 9708; ages 25-74 years). The validation data included 3 time points across 10 years in the Young Finns Study (YFS; n = 1009; ages 24-49 years). Predicted metabolic age in 2007 was compared against observed aging rate from the 2001 visit to the 2011 visit in the YFS dataset and correlation between predicted vs observed metabolic aging was determined. The cross-sectional proxy failed to predict longitudinal observations (R2 = 0.018%, P = 0.67). The finding is unexpected under the clock hypothesis that would produce a positive correlation between predicted and observed aging.

Estonian Biobank,38185688,Rare copy-number variants as modulators of common disease susceptibility.,"Copy-number variations (CNVs) have been associated with rare and debilitating genomic disorders (GDs) but their impact on health later in life in the general population remains poorly described. Assessing four modes of CNV action, we performed genome-wide association scans (GWASs) between the copy-number of CNV-proxy probes and 60 curated ICD-10 based clinical diagnoses in 331,522 unrelated white British UK Biobank (UKBB) participants with replication in the Estonian Biobank. We identified 73 signals involving 40 diseases, all of which indicating that CNVs increased disease risk and caused earlier onset. We estimated that 16% of these associations are indirect, acting by increasing body mass index (BMI). Signals mapped to 45 unique, non-overlapping regions, nine of which being linked to known GDs. Number and identity of genes affected by CNVs modulated their pathogenicity, with many associations being supported by colocalization with both common and rare single-nucleotide variant association signals. Dissection of association signals provided insights into the epidemiology of known gene-disease pairs (e.g., deletions in BRCA1 and LDLR increased risk for ovarian cancer and ischemic heart disease, respectively), clarified dosage mechanisms of action (e.g., both increased and decreased dosage of 17q12 impacted renal health), and identified putative causal genes (e.g., ABCC6 for kidney stones). Characterization of the pleiotropic pathological consequences of recurrent CNVs at 15q13, 16p13.11, 16p12.2, and 22q11.2 in adulthood indicated variable expressivity of these regions and the involvement of multiple genes. Finally, we show that while the total burden of rare CNVs-and especially deletions-strongly associated with disease risk, it only accounted for ~ 0.02% of the UKBB disease burden. These associations are mainly driven by CNVs at known GD CNV regions, whose pleiotropic effect on common diseases was broader than anticipated by our CNV-GWAS. Our results shed light on the prominent role of rare CNVs in determining common disease susceptibility within the general population and provide actionable insights for anticipating later-onset comorbidities in carriers of recurrent CNVs.",Genome medicine,2024,Humans; Disease Susceptibility; Genome-Wide Association Study; Body Mass Index; Genomics,False,0

The contribution to biological understanding from previous genetic studies has thus been limited. We performed a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies across 1,222,882 individuals of European ancestry (137,136 cases) and 58,051 admixed individuals with African and Native American ancestry (13,624 cases).

Estonian Biobank,39020289,Gut microbiome in endometriosis: a cohort study on 1000 individuals.,"Endometriosis, defined as the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside of the uterus, is one of the most prevalent gynecological disorders. Although different theories have been proposed, its pathogenesis is not clear. Novel studies indicate that the gut microbiome may be involved in the etiology of endometriosis; nevertheless, the connection between microbes, their dysbiosis, and the development of endometriosis is understudied. This case-control study analyzed the gut microbiome in women with and without endometriosis to identify microbial targets involved in the disease. A subsample of 1000 women from the Estonian Microbiome cohort, including 136 women with endometriosis and 864 control women, was analyzed. Microbial composition was determined by shotgun metagenomics and microbial functional pathways were annotated using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm was performed to cluster the microbial profile of the Estonian population. The alpha- and beta-diversity and differential abundance analyses were performed to assess the gut microbiome (species and KEGG orthologies (KO)) in both groups. Metagenomic reads were mapped to estrobolome-related enzymes' sequences to study potential microbiome-estrogen metabolism axis alterations in endometriosis. Diversity analyses did not detect significant differences between women with and without endometriosis (alpha-diversity: all p-values > 0.05; beta-diversity: PERMANOVA, both R  Our findings do not provide enough evidence to support the existence of a gut microbiome-dependent mechanism directly implicated in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.

Using data from 12 cohorts, including 18,265 cases with cirrhosis, 1,782,047 controls, up to 1 million individuals with liver function tests and a validation cohort of 21,689 cases and 617,729 controls, we identify and validate 14 risk associations for cirrhosis. Many variants are located near genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. One of these, PNPLA3 p.Ile148Met, interacts with alcohol intake, obesity and diabetes on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We develop a polygenic risk score that associates with the progression from cirrhosis to HCC. By focusing on prioritized genes from common variant analyses, we find that rare coding variants in GPAM associate with lower ALT, supporting GPAM as a potential target for therapeutic inhibition.

We identified five genetic loci linked to PPH in a meta-analysis. Functional annotation analysis indicated candidate genes HAND2, TBX3 and RAP2C/FRMD7 at three loci and showed that at each locus, associated variants were located within binding sites for progesterone receptors. There were strong genetic correlations with birth weight, gestational duration and uterine fibroids. Bleeding in early pregnancy yielded no genome-wide association signals but showed strong genetic correlation with various human traits, suggesting a potentially complex, polygenic etiology.

CRISPR gene editing further showed that ADRA2A and NOS3 loci modified gene expression and in situ RNAscope clarified the specificity of ADRA2A in small vessels and IRX1 around small capillaries in the skin. A functional contraction assay in the cold showed lower contraction in ADRA2A-deficient and higher contraction in ADRA2A-overexpressing smooth muscle cells. Overall, our study highlights the power of genome-wide association testing with functional follow-up as a method to understand complex diseases.

To produce risk estimates relevant to clinical and public health decision-making, it is important to account for varying effects due to age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases. We integrate PGS associations from seven studies in four countries (N = 1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGS has a significant sex-specific effect for asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes (T2D), with all but T2D exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS has a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with effects decreasing linearly with age. We show for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20% of polygenic risk, the top 5% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. Our framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting for age- and sex-specific PGS effects.

In the present study we reconcile these two approaches by showing that linkage signals of height and body mass index (BMI) from 119,000 sibling pairs colocalize with GWAS-identified loci. Concordant with polygenicity, we observed the following: a genome-wide inflation of linkage test statistics; that GWAS results predict linkage signals; and that adjusting phenotypes for polygenic scores reduces linkage signals. Finally, we developed a method using recombination rate-stratified, identity-by-descent sharing between siblings to unbiasedly estimate heritability of height (0.76 ± 0.05) and BMI (0.55 ± 0.07).

Research suggests that susceptibility to ACEi-induced angioedema (ACEi-AE) involves both genetic and nongenetic risk factors. Genome- and exome-wide studies of ACEi-AE have identified the first genetic risk loci. However, understanding of the underlying pathophysiology remains limited. We sought to identify further genetic factors of ACEi-AE to eventually gain a deeper understanding of its pathophysiology. By combining data from 8 cohorts, a genome-wide association study meta-analysis was performed in more than 1000 European patients with ACEi-AE. Secondary bioinformatic analyses were conducted to fine-map associated loci, identify relevant genes and pathways, and assess the genetic overlap between ACEi-AE and other traits. Finally, an exploratory cross-ancestry analysis was performed to assess shared genetic factors in European and African-American patients with ACEi-AE. Three genome-wide significant risk loci were identified. One of these, located on chromosome 20q11.22, has not been implicated previously in ACEi-AE. Integrative secondary analyses highlighted previously reported genes (BDKRB2 [bradykinin receptor B2] and F5 [coagulation factor 5]) as well as biologically plausible novel candidate genes (PROCR [protein C receptor] and EDEM2 [endoplasmic reticulum degradation enhancing alpha-mannosidase like protein 2]). Lead variants at the risk loci were found with similar effect sizes and directions in an African-American cohort. The present results contributed to a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of ACEi-AE by (1) providing further evidence for the involvement of bradykinin signaling and coagulation pathways and (2) suggesting, for the first time, the involvement of the fibrinolysis pathway in this adverse drug reaction.

GWAS is a powerful approach to identify links between genetic variants and phenotypic variation; however, identifying the genes driving associations identified in GWAS remains challenging. Integration of molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) such as expression QTL (eQTL) using mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses can help with the identification of causal genes. Careful interpretation remains warranted because eQTL can affect the expression of multiple genes within the same locus. We used a combination of genomic features that include variant annotation, activity-by-contact maps, MR, and colocalization with molQTL to prioritize causal genes across 4,611 disease GWAS and meta-analyses from biobank studies, namely FinnGen, Estonian Biobank and UK Biobank. Genes identified using this approach are enriched for gold standard causal genes and capture known biological links between disease genetics and biology. In addition, we find that eQTL colocalizing with GWAS are statistically enriched for corresponding disease-relevant tissues. We show that predicted directionality from MR is generally consistent with matched drug mechanism of actions (> 85% for approved drugs). Compared to the nearest gene mapping method, genes supported by multi-omics evidences displayed higher enrichment in approved therapeutic targets (risk ratio 1.75 vs. 2.58 for genes with the highest level of support). Finally, using this approach, we detected anassociation between the IL6 receptor signal transduction gene IL6ST and polymyalgia rheumatica, an indication for which sarilumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6, has been recently approved.

Appropriate prediction of presence of bowel necrosis is currently not available but would help to choose the optimal method of treatment. The study aims to identify combinations of biomarkers that can reliably identify AMI and distinguish between potentially reversible and irreversible bowel ischaemia. This is a prospective multicentre study. Adult patients with clinical suspicion of AMI (n = 250) will be included. Blood will be sampled on admission, at and after interventions, or during the first 48 h of suspicion of AMI if no intervention undertaken. Samples will be collected and the following serum or plasma biomarkers measured at Tartu University Hospital laboratory: intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), alpha-glutathione S-transferase (Alpha- GST), interleukin 6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), ischaemia-modified albumin (IMA), D-lactate, D-dimer, signal peptide-CUB-EGF domain-containing protein 1 (SCUBE-1) and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP). Additionally, more common laboratory markers will be measured in routine clinical practice at study sites. Diagnosis of AMI will be confirmed by computed tomography angiography, surgery, endoscopy or autopsy. Student's t or Wilcoxon rank tests will be used for comparisons between transmural vs. suspected (but not confirmed) AMI (comparison A), confirmed AMI of any stage vs suspected AMI (comparison B) and non-transmural AMI vs transmural AMI (comparison C). Optimal cut-off values for each comparison will be identified based on the AUROC analysis and likelihood ratios calculated. Positive likelihood ratio > 10 (> 5) and negative likelihood ratio < 0.1 (< 0.2) indicate high (moderate) diagnostic accuracy, respectively. All biomarkers with at least moderate accuracy will be entered as binary covariates (using the best cutoffs) into the multivariable stepwise regression analysis to identify the best combination of biomarkers for all comparisons separately.

Estonian Biobank,38816834,Variability of polygenic prediction for body mass index in Africa.,"Polygenic prediction studies in continental Africans are scarce. Africa's genetic and environmental diversity pose a challenge that limits the generalizability of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for body mass index (BMI) within the continent. Studies to understand the factors that affect PRS variability within Africa are required. Using the first multi-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis for BMI involving continental Africans, we derived a multi-ancestry PRS and compared its performance to a European ancestry-specific PRS in continental Africans (AWI-Gen study) and a European cohort (Estonian Biobank). We then evaluated the factors affecting the performance of the PRS in Africans which included fine-mapping resolution, allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium patterns, and PRS-environment interactions. Polygenic prediction of BMI in continental Africans is poor compared to that in European ancestry individuals. However, we show that the multi-ancestry PRS is more predictive than the European ancestry-specific PRS due to its improved fine-mapping resolution. We noted regional variation in polygenic prediction across Africa's East, South, and West regions, which was driven by a complex interplay of the PRS with environmental factors, such as physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, and socioeconomic status. Our findings highlight the role of gene-environment interactions in PRS prediction variability in Africa. PRS methods that correct for these interactions, coupled with the increased representation of Africans in GWAS, may improve PRS prediction in Africa.",Genome medicine,2024,"Humans; Body Mass Index; Multifactorial Inheritance; Genome-Wide Association Study; Africa; Black People; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; White People; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Gene Frequency; Gene-Environment Interaction; Linkage Disequilibrium; Male; Female",False,6

Estonian Biobank,38408933,Body mass index stratified meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of polycystic ovary syndrome in women of European ancestry.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex multifactorial disorder with a substantial genetic component. However, the clinical manifestations of PCOS are heterogeneous with notable differences between lean and obese women, implying a different pathophysiology manifesting in differential body mass index (BMI). We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from six well-characterised cohorts, using a case-control study design stratified by BMI, aiming to identify genetic variants associated with lean and overweight/obese PCOS subtypes. The study comprised 254,588 women (5,937 cases and 248,651 controls) from individual studies performed in Australia, Estonia, Finland, the Netherlands and United States of America, and separated according to three BMI stratifications (lean, overweight and obese). Genome-wide association analyses were performed for each stratification within each cohort, with the data for each BMI group meta-analysed using METAL software. Almost half of the total study population (47%, n = 119,584) were of lean BMI (≤ 25 kg/m Genetic variation at the XBP1, LINC02905 and ERBB4 loci were associated with PCOS within unique BMI strata, while DENND1A demonstrated associations across multiple strata, providing evidence of both distinct and shared genetic features between lean and overweight/obese PCOS-affected women. This study demonstrated that PCOS-affected women with contrasting body weight are not only phenotypically distinct but also show variation in genetic architecture; lean PCOS women typically display elevated gonadotrophin ratios, lower insulin resistance, higher androgen levels, including adrenal androgens, and more favourable lipid profiles. Overall, these findings add to the growing body of evidence supporting a genetic basis for PCOS as well as differences in genetic patterns relevant to PCOS BMI-subtype.",BMC genomics,2024,Female; Humans; Body Mass Index; Genome-Wide Association Study; Overweight; Case-Control Studies; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Obesity,False,6
Estonian Biobank,38520066,The endometrial transcriptome of infertile women with and without implantation failure.,"Implantation failure after transferring morphologically ""good-quality"" embryos in in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) may be explained by impaired endometrial receptivity. Analyzing the endometrial transcriptome analysis may reveal the underlying processes and could help in guiding prognosis and using targeted interventions for infertility. This exploratory study investigated whether the endometrial transcriptome profile was associated with short-term or long-term implantation outcomes (ie success or failure). Mid-luteal phase endometrial biopsies of 107 infertile women with one full failed IVF/ICSI cycle, obtained within an endometrial scratching trial, were subjected to RNA-sequencing and differentially expressed genes analysis with covariate adjustment (age, body mass index, luteinizing hormone [LH]-day). Endometrial transcriptomes were compared between implantation failure and success groups in the short term (after the second fresh IVF/ICSI cycle) and long term (including all fresh and frozen cycles within 12 months). The short-term analysis included 85/107 women (33 ongoing pregnancy vs 52 no pregnancy), excluding 22/107 women. The long-term analysis included 46/107 women (23 'fertile' group, ie infertile women with a live birth after ≤3 embryos transferred vs 23 recurrent implantation failure group, ie no live birth after ≥3 good quality embryos transferred), excluding 61/107 women not fitting these categories. As both analyses drew from the same pool of 107 samples, there was some sample overlap. Additionally, cell type enrichment scores and endometrial receptivity were analyzed, and an endometrial development pseudo-timeline was constructed to estimate transcriptomic deviations from the optimum receptivity day (LH + 7), denoted as ΔWOI (window of implantation). There were no significantly differentially expressed genes between implantation failure and success groups in either the short-term or long-term analyses. Principal component analysis initially showed two clusters in the long-term analysis, unrelated to clinical phenotype and no longer distinct following covariate adjustment. Cell type enrichment scores did not differ significantly between groups in both analyses. However, endometrial receptivity analysis demonstrated a potentially significant displacement of the WOI in the non-pregnant group compared with the ongoing pregnant group in the short-term analysis. No distinct endometrial transcriptome profile was associated with either implantation failure or success in infertile women. However, there may be differences in the extent to which the WOI is displaced.",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,2024,"Humans; Female; Infertility, Female; Endometrium; Adult; Transcriptome; Embryo Implantation; Pregnancy; Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic; Embryo Transfer; Fertilization in Vitro",False,3
Estonian Biobank,38503741,SCGB1D2 inhibits growth of Borrelia burgdorferi and affects susceptibility to Lyme disease.,"Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease caused by bacteria of the genus Borrelia. The host factors that modulate susceptibility for Lyme disease have remained mostly unknown. Using epidemiological and genetic data from FinnGen and Estonian Biobank, we identify two previously known variants and an unknown common missense variant at the gene encoding for Secretoglobin family 1D member 2 (SCGB1D2) protein that increases the susceptibility for Lyme disease. Using live Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) we find that recombinant reference SCGB1D2 protein inhibits the growth of Bb in vitro more efficiently than the recombinant protein with SCGB1D2 P53L deleterious missense variant. Finally, using an in vivo murine infection model we show that recombinant SCGB1D2 prevents infection by Borrelia in vivo. Together, these data suggest that SCGB1D2 is a host defense factor present in the skin, sweat, and other secretions which protects against Bb infection and opens an exciting therapeutic avenue for Lyme disease.",Nature communications,2024,Animals; Humans; Mice; Borrelia burgdorferi; Ixodes; Lyme Disease; Secretoglobins,False,7

Previous GWASs have detected several risk loci for psoriasis. To further improve the understanding of the genetic risk factors impacting the disease, we conducted a discovery GWAS in FinnGen and a subsequent replication and meta-analysis with data from the Estonian Biobank and the UK Biobank; the study sample included 925,649 individuals (22,659 cases and 902,990 controls), the largest sample for psoriasis yet. In addition, we conducted downstream analyses to find out more about psoriasis' cross-trait genetic correlations and causal relationships. We report 6 risk loci, which, to our knowledge, are previously unreported, most of which harbor genes related to NF-κB signaling pathway and overall immunity. Genetic correlations highlight the relationship between psoriasis and smoking, higher body weight, and lower education level. In addition, we report causal relationships between psoriasis and mood symptoms as well as 2-directioned causal relationship between psoriasis and lower education level.

Estonian Biobank,39412545,High SHBG and Low Bioavailable Testosterone are Strongly Causally Associated with Increased Forearm Fracture Risk in Women: An MR Study Leveraging Novel Female-Specific Data.,"The effects of androgens on women's bone health are not fully understood. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies using sex-combined data suggest that sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and bioavailable testosterone (BioT) causally affect bone traits. Given significant sex differences in hormone regulation and effects, female-specific MR studies are necessary. In the current study, we explored the causal relationships of SHBG, BioT, and total testosterone (TT) with forearm fracture (FAFx) risk in women using two-sample MR analyses. We utilized a unique female-specific FAFx outcome dataset from three European biobanks (UFO, HUNT, Estonian Biobank) comprising 111,351 women and 8823 FAFx cases, along with female-specific genetic instruments of SHBG, BioT, and TT identified in the UK Biobank. We also assessed bone mineral density (BMD) at the forearm (FA), femoral neck (FN), and lumbar spine (LS) using female-specific GWAS data from the GEFOS consortium. High SHBG (odds ratio per standard deviation increase (OR/SD): 1.53, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.34-1.75), low BioT (OR/SD: 0.77, 0.71-0.84) and low TT (OR/SD 0.90, 0.83-0.98) were causally associated with increased FAFx risk. BioT was positively, and SHBG inversely, causally associated with especially FA-BMD, but also LS-BMD and FN-BMD, while TT was only significantly positively associated with FA-BMD and LS-BMD. We propose that endogenous androgens and SHBG are important for women's bone health at distal trabecular-rich bone sites such as the distal forearm and may serve as predictors for FAFx risk.",Calcified tissue international,2024,"Humans; Female; Testosterone; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Bone Density; Middle Aged; Forearm Injuries; Aged; Risk Factors; Forearm; Fractures, Bone",False,0
Estonian Biobank,39438584,Comorbidities confound metabolomics studies of human disease.,"The co-occurrence of multiple chronic conditions, termed multimorbidity, presents an expanding global health challenge, demanding effective diagnostics and treatment strategies. Chronic ailments such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases have been linked to metabolites interacting between the host and microbiota. In this study, we investigated the impact of co-existing conditions on risk estimations for 1375 plasma metabolites in 919 individuals from population-based Estonian Biobank cohort using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method. We leveraged annually linked national electronic health records (EHRs) data to delineate comorbidities in incident cases and controls for the 14 common chronic conditions. Among the 254 associations observed across 13 chronic conditions, we primarily identified disease-specific risk factors (92%, 217/235), with most predictors (93%, 219/235) found to be related to the gut microbiome upon cross-referencing recent literature data. Accounting for comorbidities led to a reduction of common metabolite predictors across various conditions.

All adult patients with clinical suspicion of AMI admitted or transferred to 32 participating hospitals from 06.06.2022 to 05.04.2023 were included. Participants who were subsequently shown not to have AMI or had localized intestinal gangrene due to strangulating bowel obstruction had only baseline and outcome data collected. AMI occurred in 0.038% of adult admissions in participating acute care hospitals worldwide. From a total of 705 included patients, 418 patients had confirmed AMI. In 69% AMI was the primary reason for admission, while in 31% AMI occurred after having been admitted with another diagnosis. Median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission in patients admitted due to AMI was 24 h (interquartile range 9-48h) and time from admission to diagnosis was 6h (1-12 h). Occlusive arterial AMI was diagnosed in 231 (55.3%), venous in 73 (17.5%), non-occlusive (NOMI) in 55 (13.2%), other type in 11 (2.6%) and the subtype could not be classified in 48 (11.5%) patients. Surgery was the initial management in 242 (58%) patients, of which 59 (24.4%) underwent revascularization. Endovascular revascularization alone was carried out in 54 (13%), conservative treatment in 76 (18%) and palliative care in 46 (11%) patients. From patients with occlusive arterial AMI, revascularization was undertaken in 104 (45%), with 40 (38%) of them in one site admitting selected patients. Overall in-hospital and 90-day mortality of AMI was 49% and 53.3%, respectively, and among subtypes was lowest for venous AMI (13.7% and 16.4%) and highest for NOMI (72.7% and 74.5%). There was a high variability between participating sites for most variables studied. The overall incidence of AMI and AMI subtypes varies worldwide, and case ascertainment is challenging. Pre-hospital delay in presentation was greater than delays after arriving at hospital. Surgery without revascularization was the most common management approach. Nearly half of the patients with AMI died during their index hospitalization. Together, these findings suggest a need for greater awareness of AMI, and better guidance in diagnosis and management.

The present study aims to validate the recently developed Gastrointestinal Dysfunction Score (GIDS) in a multicenter, prospective cohort of consecutive adult patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). GUTPHOS is a prospective, multicenter, non-interventional cohort study in which at least 1400 consecutive adult patients (age ≥18 years) admitted to the ICU will be monitored daily for abdominal signs and symptoms of GI dysfunction. The previously developed GIDS constructed from these signs and symptoms will be tested in relation to mortality and duration of ICU dependency and parenteral nutrition (PN) dependency. Between January and June 2024, each participating clinical site will include 50-120 consecutive patients over an eight-week period. Study data will be collected in three phases: baseline data upon ICU admission, daily observations throughout a maximum of 7 days in ICU or until discharge, and a follow-up period of 90 days. The primary outcomes are 28- and 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes include ICU and hospital mortality, ICU and hospital length of stay, days alive and free of ICU by day 28 and day 90, days alive and free of hospital by day 28 and day 90, and days alive and free of organ support and PN dependency by day 28. The GUTPHOS study will be the first worldwide, multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study to validate the GIDS in adult patients admitted to ICUs against 28- and 90-day mortality.

In this proof of principle study, we investigated if genetic liability for schizophrenia is associated with high dose requirements of antipsychotics and antipsychotic polypharmacy, using real-world registry and biobank data from five independent Nordic cohorts of a total of N = 21,572 individuals with psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other psychosis). Within regression models, a polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia was studied in relation to standardized antipsychotic dose as well as antipsychotic polypharmacy, defined based on longitudinal prescription registry data as well as health records and self-reported data. Meta-analyses across the five cohorts showed that PRS for schizophrenia was significantly positively associated with prescribed (standardized) antipsychotic dose (beta(SE) = 0.0435(0.009), p = 0.0006) and antipsychotic polypharmacy defined as taking ≥2 antipsychotics (OR = 1.10, CI = 1.05-1.21, p = 0.0073). The direction of effect was similar in all five independent cohorts. These findings indicate that genotypes may aid clinically relevant decisions on individual patients´ antipsychotic treatment.

In this study, we investigate the interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and T2D risk in the UK Biobank dataset using the Nightingale panel composed of 249 metabolites, 92% of which correspond to lipids (HDL, IDL, LDL, VLDL) and lipoproteins. By integrating these data with large-scale T2D GWAS from the DIAMANTE meta-analysis through Mendelian randomization analyses, we find 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2D, all spanning lipid-related classes except for Glucose and Tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites are causally affected by T2D liability, spanning almost all tested classes, including branched-chain amino acids. Secondly, using an interaction quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, we describe four metabolites consistently replicated in an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank, for which genetic loci in two different genomic regions show attenuated regulation in T2D cases compared to controls. The significant variants from the interaction QTL analysis are significant QTLs for the corresponding metabolites in the general population but are not associated with T2D risk, pointing towards consequences of T2D on the genetic regulation of metabolite levels. Finally, through differential level analyses, we find 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macrovascular, or both types of T2D complications, with only a few discriminating between complication classes. Of the 165 metabolites, 40 are not causally linked to T2D in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications. Overall, this work provides a map of the consequences of T2D on Nightingale targeted metabolite levels and on their genetic regulation, enabling a better understanding of the T2D trajectory leading to complications.",PLoS genetics,2024,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Quantitative Trait Loci; Genome-Wide Association Study; Metabolomics; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Metabolome; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Lipoproteins; Lipids; United Kingdom",False,7

We used self- and informant-ratings of the Five-Factor Model domains and their subtraits (a) measured approximately at the time of vaccination with the 100 Nuances of Personality (100NP) item pool (N = 56,575) and (b) measured on average ten years before the pandemic with the NEO Personality Inventory-3 (NEO-PI-3; N = 3,168). We tested individual domains' and either items' (in the 100NP sample) or facets' (in the NEO-PI-3 sample) associations with vaccination, as well as their collective ability to predict vaccination using elastic net models trained and tested in independent sample partitions. Although the NEO-PI-3 domains and facets did not predict vaccination ten years later, the domains correlated with vaccination in the 100NP sample, with vaccinated people scoring slightly higher on neuroticism and agreeableness and lower on openness, controlling for age, sex, and education. Collectively, the five domains predicted vaccination with an accuracy of r = .08. Associations were stronger at the item level. Vaccinated people were, on average, more science-minded, politically liberal, respectful of rules and authority, and anxious but less spiritual, religious, and self-assured.

Estonian Biobank,39192486,Genetic susceptibility to temporomandibular joint involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis.,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic condition of childhood. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is among the most commonly affected joints in JIA patients. When JIA involves the TMJ, it may affect condylar growth in the joint; therefore, JIA patients are at risk of unfavourable long-term outcomes from associated joint damage. If undetected, TMJ involvement can lead to various functional disabilities such as reduced mandibular mobility and disorders of the mastication muscles. Limitations in sagittal and vertical mandibular growth can result in micrognathia and anterior open bite with aesthetic and functional restrictions. Genetic factors may play a role in determining which individuals are more prone to develop TMJ disorders or in predicting the severity of the disease process. Therefore, we applied a GWAS approach to identify loci associated with TMJ involvement in a sample of Estonian patients with JIA. Our aim was to address the potential role of genetic susceptibility factors in TMJ-JIA, a condition not previously studied in this context. The case group consisted of 55 JIA patients with TMJ involvement and 208 patients without TMJ involvement comprised the control group. The entire cohort was genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip arrays. Imputation was performed using a nationwide reference panel obtained of 2240 individuals whose data were obtained from the Estonian Biobank. We identified six loci as being associated with the risk of TMJ-JIA in Estonian JIA patients. The strongest associations were identified at CD6 rs3019551 (P = 3.80 × 10 This study provides first insights into the risk-associated loci between JIA and its manifestation in the TMJ.

We performed a genome-wide association study and meta-analysis of data from 34,422 individuals with acne and 364,991 controls from three independent European-ancestry cohorts. We replicated 19 previously implicated genome-wide significant risk loci and identified four novel loci [11q12.2 (FADS2), 12q21.1 (LGR5), 17q25.3 (FASN), and 22q12.1 (ZNRF3-KREMEN1)], bringing the total number of reported acne risk loci to 50. Our meta-analysis results explain 9.4% of the phenotypic variance of acne. A polygenic model of acne risk variants showed that individuals in the top 5% of the risk percentiles had a 1.62-fold (95% CI 1.47-1.78) increased acne risk relative to individuals with average risk (20-80% on the polygenic risk score distribution). Our findings highlight the Wnt and MAPK pathways as key factors in the genetic predisposition to acne vulgaris, together with the effects of genetic variation on the structure and maintenance of the hair follicle and pilosebaceous unit.

The RNA profiling was done on whole blood samples from 1017 adult male and female donors to the Estonian biobank using Illumina HTv3 arrays. Our results suggest that TPMT is closely related to genes involved in oxidoreductive processes. The in vitro experiments on different cell models confirmed that TPMT influences redox capacity of the cell by altering S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) consumption and consequently glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Furthermore, by comparing gene networks of subgroups of individuals, we identified genes, which could have a role in regulating TPMT activity.

Estonian Biobank,39127804,Ancestral genetic components are consistently associated with the complex trait landscape in European biobanks.,"The genetic structure in Europe was mostly shaped by admixture between the Western Hunter-Gatherers, Early European Farmers and Steppe Bronze Age ancestral components. Such structure is regarded as a confounder in GWAS and follow-up studies, and gold-standard methods exist to correct for it. However, it is still poorly understood to which extent these ancestral components contribute to complex trait variation in present-day Europe. In this work we harness the UK Biobank to address this question. By extensive demographic simulations, exploiting data on siblings and incorporating previous results we obtained from the Estonian Biobank, we carefully evaluate the significance and scope of our findings. Heart rate, platelet count, bone mineral density and many other traits show stratification similar to height and pigmentation traits, likely targets of selection and divergence across ancestral groups. We show that the reported ancestry-trait associations are not driven by environmental confounders by confirming our results when using between-sibling differences in ancestry. The consistency of our results across biobanks further supports this and indicates that these genetic predispositions that derive from post-Neolithic admixture events act as a source of variability and as potential confounders in Europe as a whole.",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2024,Humans; Europe; Biological Specimen Banks; Multifactorial Inheritance; Genome-Wide Association Study; White People,False,1
Estonian Biobank,38663478,"Identifying Atopic Dermatitis Risk Loci in 1,094,060 Individuals with Subanalysis of Disease Severity and Onset.","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease highly attributable to genetic factors. In this study, we report results from a genome-wide meta-analysis of AD in 37,541 cases and 1,056,519 controls with data from the FinnGen project, the Estonian Biobank, the UK Biobank, the EAGLE Consortium, and the BioBank Japan. We detected 77 independent AD-associated loci, of which 10 were, to our knowledge, previously unreported. The associated loci showed enrichment in various immune regulatory processes. We further performed subgroup analyses of mild and severe AD and of early- and late-onset AD, with data from the FinnGen project. Fifty-five of the 79 tested variants in the associated loci showed larger effect estimates for severe than for mild AD as determined through administered treatment. The age of onset, as determined by the first hospital visit with AD diagnosis, was lower in patients with particular AD-risk alleles. Our findings add to the knowledge of the genetic background of AD and may underlie the development of new therapeutic strategies.",The Journal of investigative dermatology,2024,"Humans; Age of Onset; Alleles; Case-Control Studies; Dermatitis, Atopic; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Japan; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Severity of Illness Index",False,5
Estonian Biobank,38377669,Genome-wide association study in Estonia reveals importance of vaginal epithelium associated genes in case of recurrent vaginitis.,"Recurrent vaginitis is a leading reason for visiting a gynaecologist, with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) being the most common diagnoses. Reasons and mechanisms behind their recurrent nature are poorly understood. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to find possible genetic risk factors for recurrent vaginitis using data from a large population-based biobank, the Estonian Biobank. The study included 6870 cases (at least two episodes of vaginitis) and 5945 controls (no vaginitis episodes). GWAS approach included single marker and gene-based analyses, followed by functional annotation of associated variants and candidate gene mapping.In single marker analysis, one statistically significant (P = 7.8 × 10",Journal of reproductive immunology,2024,"Female; Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Estonia; Trichomonas Vaginitis; Vaginosis, Bacterial; Candidiasis, Vulvovaginal",False,7
Estonian Biobank,38563284,Associations between attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder genetic liability and ICD-10 medical conditions in adults: utilizing electronic health records in a Phenome-Wide Association Study.,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often comorbid with other medical conditions in adult patients. However, ADHD is extremely underdiagnosed in adults and little is known about the medical comorbidities in undiagnosed adult individuals with high ADHD liability. In this study we investigated associations between ADHD genetic liability and electronic health record (EHR)-based ICD-10 diagnoses across all diagnostic categories, in individuals without ADHD diagnosis history. We used data from the Estonian Biobank cohort ( After Bonferroni correction ( Overall our findings indicate that ADHD genetic liability is associated with an increased risk of a substantial number of medical conditions in undiagnosed individuals. These results highlight the need for timely detection and improved management of ADHD symptoms in adults.",Psychological medicine,2024,Humans; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Electronic Health Records; Male; Female; International Classification of Diseases; Adult; Middle Aged; Genome-Wide Association Study; Estonia; Multifactorial Inheritance; Comorbidity; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Aged,False,0

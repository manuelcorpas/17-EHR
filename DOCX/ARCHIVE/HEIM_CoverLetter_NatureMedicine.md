**Re:** Submission of "Three Dimensions of Neglect: How Biobanks, Clinical Trials, and Scientific Literature Systematically Exclude the Global South"

---

Dear Editors,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript "Three Dimensions of Neglect" for consideration as an Analysis article in *Nature Medicine*.

## Why Nature Medicine?

This work addresses a fundamental challenge in global health: the systematic exclusion of diseases affecting 1.5 billion people from the biomedical research enterprise. *Nature Medicine*'s commitment to publishing research that advances human health and its global readership make it the ideal venue for findings that reveal structural barriers to health equity and provide actionable metrics for change.

## Key Findings and Novelty

Our analysis of 70 international biobanks, 563,725 clinical trials, and 13.1 million PubMed abstracts reveals that:

1. **Neglected tropical diseases exhibit 44% higher semantic isolation** in the scientific literature than other conditions (P < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 1.80), indicating they are disconnected from methodological innovations that could accelerate progress.

2. **Only 1 of 70 major biobanks achieves high equity alignment** with global disease burden, with African biobanks producing just 0.7% of publications despite Africa bearing 24% of global disease burden.

3. **Clinical trial sites concentrate 2.5-fold in high-income countries**, with diseases like lymphatic filariasis receiving 538-fold fewer trials than type 2 diabetes despite comparable burden.

4. **The ten most neglected diseases are exclusively conditions of the Global South**, experiencing compounding disadvantage across all three dimensions.

Unlike previous single-dimension analyses, our Health Equity Informative Metrics (HEIM) framework captures compounding disadvantage across the full research lifecycle. We provide not only diagnosis but actionable policy targets and an interactive monitoring dashboard.

## Relevance to Readership

This work will interest *Nature Medicine* readers across global health, clinical research, and health policy. The findings challenge funders, biobank consortia, and trial sponsors to adopt measurable equity targets. The HIV/AIDS comparison demonstrates that structural marginalization can be reversed, providing a replicable model.

## Suggested Reviewers

1. **Prof. Peter Hotez** — Baylor College of Medicine (NTD research, global health advocacy)
2. **Prof. Lutz Bornmann** — Max Planck Society (bibliometrics, science of science)
3. **Prof. Sarah Tishkoff** — University of Pennsylvania (genomic diversity, African populations)
4. **Dr. Roderik Viergever** — WHO (research priority setting, funding allocation)
5. **Prof. Seye Abimbola** — University of Sydney (global health equity, decolonizing research)

## Excluded Reviewers

We have no specific exclusions to request. The authors have no conflicts of interest that would preclude review by experts in the field.

## Highlight Points

- **Neglected tropical diseases are 44% more semantically isolated** from mainstream biomedicine than other conditions (Cohen's d = 1.80), disconnecting them from methodological advances that could accelerate treatment development.

- **Only 1 of 70 major biobanks achieves high equity alignment** with global disease burden; African biobanks produce 0.7% of publications despite the continent bearing 24% of global burden.

- **Clinical trial infrastructure concentrates 2.5-fold in wealthy countries**, with 538-fold fewer trials for lymphatic filariasis than type 2 diabetes despite similar global burden.

- **The HIV/AIDS model demonstrates reversibility**: strategic investment can reduce semantic isolation and integrate neglected disease research into mainstream methodological communities.

We confirm that this work is original, has not been published elsewhere, and is not under consideration by another journal. All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission.

Thank you for considering our work.

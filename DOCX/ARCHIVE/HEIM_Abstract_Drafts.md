## VERSION A: Finding-Focused (Recommended)

**Word count:** 148

Global health inequities persist, yet the structural biases embedded within research infrastructure remain poorly quantified. Here we introduce the Health Equity Informative Metrics (HEIM) framework, which measures research neglect across three dimensions: Discovery (biobank research), Translation (clinical trials), and Knowledge (semantic structure of scientific literature). Analyzing 70 international biobanks, 2.2 million clinical trials, and 13.1 million PubMed abstracts spanning 176 diseases from the Global Burden of Disease taxonomy, we find that neglected tropical diseases exhibit 20% higher semantic isolation than other conditions (P=0.002, Cohen's d=0.82), indicating structural marginalization in the research landscape. Only 1 of 70 major biobanks achieves high equity alignment, and clinical trial sites concentrate 2.5-fold in high-income countries. Diseases showing compounding disadvantage across all dimensions—lymphatic filariasis, cysticercosis, dengue, scabies, and malaria—are exclusively conditions of the Global South. HEIM provides actionable metrics to guide research investment toward closing the global health equity gap.

## VERSION B: Methodology-Focused

**Word count:** 149

Quantifying structural inequities in global health research requires frameworks that span the full research lifecycle. We developed the Health Equity Informative Metrics (HEIM) framework to measure research neglect across three dimensions: Discovery (70 IHCC biobanks, 38,595 publications), Translation (2.2 million clinical trials, 770,000 site records), and Knowledge (13.1 million PubMed abstracts with transformer-based semantic embeddings). Applying HEIM to 176 disease categories from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 taxonomy, we introduce novel metrics—Semantic Isolation Index, Knowledge Transfer Potential, and Research Clustering Coefficient—that reveal hidden patterns of research marginalization. Neglected tropical diseases show 20% higher semantic isolation (P=0.002, d=0.82), form distinct clusters in the knowledge landscape, and rank highest on our Unified Neglect Score. With only 1 of 70 biobanks achieving high equity alignment and trial sites concentrated 2.5-fold in high-income countries, HEIM exposes compounding disadvantage and provides quantitative targets for research prioritization.

## VERSION C: Policy-Focused

**Word count:** 147

Despite decades of global health initiatives, research investment remains misaligned with disease burden. We present the Health Equity Informative Metrics (HEIM) framework, a three-dimensional analysis spanning biobank research (70 cohorts), clinical trials (2.2 million studies), and scientific literature (13.1 million publications) across 176 diseases. Our analysis reveals compounding structural disadvantage: neglected tropical diseases show 20% higher semantic isolation in the research literature (P=0.002, Cohen's d=0.82), only 1 of 70 major biobanks achieves high equity alignment, and clinical trial infrastructure concentrates 2.5-fold in high-income countries. The five most neglected diseases—lymphatic filariasis, cysticercosis, dengue, scabies, and malaria—share a common profile: critical gaps in biobank coverage, absent trial representation, and semantic isolation from mainstream research. These conditions collectively affect over 1 billion people. HEIM transforms abstract equity goals into measurable targets, enabling funders, consortia, and policymakers to systematically prioritize research investments where they are most needed.

## COMPARISON

| Aspect | Version A | Version B | Version C |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Lead | Problem statement | Methods need | Policy gap |
| Emphasis | Key finding (NTD isolation) | Novel metrics | Actionable impact |
| Tone | Balanced | Technical | Advocacy |
| Best for | General audience | Methods-focused reviewers | Policy-oriented journals |

## RECOMMENDED: VERSION A

Version A is recommended because:
1. Opens with clear problem statement
2. Presents HEIM framework efficiently
3. Leads with strongest finding (20% semantic isolation)
4. Includes all key statistics
5. Ends with actionable impact
6. Appropriate tone for Nature Medicine

---

## KEY STATISTICS INCLUDED

All versions include these essential numbers:
- 70 biobanks
- 2.2 million clinical trials
- 13.1 million PubMed abstracts
- 176 diseases (GBD taxonomy)
- 20% higher semantic isolation for NTDs
- P=0.002, Cohen's d=0.82
- 1 of 70 biobanks with high equity alignment

## NOTES FOR REVISION

**Potential additions if word count allows:**
- "25 years of literature (2000-2025)"
- Specific DALY burden numbers
- WHO region breakdown

**Terms to verify:**
- "semantic isolation" — novel term, may need brief definition
- "transformer-based embeddings" — may be too technical for abstract
- "compounding disadvantage" — clear but verify usage

**Journal style:**
- Nature Medicine prefers active voice
- Quantitative findings should be prominent
- End with significance/impact statement

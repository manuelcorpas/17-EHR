# HEIM Clinical Trials Extension: Paper Briefing Document

**Prepared for:** Manuel Corpas
**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Purpose:** Comprehensive data and insights for extending HEIM paper with clinical trials analysis

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis extends the Health Equity Informative Metrics (HEIM) framework from biobank research to clinical trials, revealing a **"Research-to-Translation Gap"** where health equity disparities persist—and in some cases worsen—as scientific discoveries move toward clinical application.

### Key Finding (One-Sentence Summary)
> Despite 2.19 million clinical trials conducted between 2000-2025, Global South Priority diseases—which account for 38% of global disease burden—receive only 20% of research attention, with an intensity gap of 2.4x compared to other conditions.

## Part 1: Core Statistics

### 1.1 Overall Dataset

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total clinical trials analyzed | **2,189,930** |
| Date range | 2000-2025 (26 years) |
| GBD disease categories mapped | 89 |
| Total disease burden covered | 2,410 million DALYs |
| Countries with trial sites | 194 |
| Total trial site records | 770,178 |

### 1.2 Global South Priority Diseases

| Metric | GS Priority | Non-GS | Ratio |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Number of diseases | 30 | 59 | - |
| Total trials | 444,502 (20.3%) | 1,745,428 (79.7%) | 1:3.9 |
| Disease burden (DALYs) | 914.8M (38.0%) | 1,495.2M (62.0%) | 1:1.6 |
| Research intensity | 486 trials/M DALY | 1,167 trials/M DALY | **1:2.4** |

**Interpretation:** Global South Priority diseases carry 38% of global disease burden but receive only 20% of clinical trial attention—a nearly 2:1 mismatch. The research intensity gap (2.4x) demonstrates systematic under-investment.

## Part 2: Research Intensity Analysis

### 2.1 Highest Research Intensity (Mostly Cancers)

| Disease | Trials/Million DALYs | Total Trials | DALYs |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| Intestinal nematode infections* | 32,079 | 44,321 | 1.4M |

## Part 4: Temporal Trends (2000-2025)

### 4.1 Trial Volume Growth

| Period | Annual Trials | Growth |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| 2000 | 2,332 | baseline |
| 2010 | 17,506 | 7.5x |
| 2020 | 33,393 | 14.3x |
| 2025 | 36,212 | **15.5x** |

### 4.2 Global South Priority Share Decline

| Period | Average GS Share | Interpretation |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| 2000-2005 | **47.7%** | Near-proportional to burden |
| 2010-2015 | 36.0% | Declining |
| 2020-2025 | **35.5%** | Structural neglect |
| **Change** | **-12.3 pp** | Worsening disparity |

**Critical Finding:** Despite a 15.5x increase in trial volume, the share dedicated to Global South Priority diseases has *declined* by 12.3 percentage points. The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily increased GS share (43.1% in 2020) but this was transient.

## Part 5: Severely Neglected Diseases

### 5.1 Global South Diseases with <500 Trials (2000-2025)

| Disease | Trials | DALYs | Trials/Year |
|---------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Typhoid and paratyphoid | 483 | 8.1M | 19 |
| Yellow fever | 459 | 0.3M | 18 |
| Leishmaniasis | 358 | 0.8M | 14 |
| Dengue | 273 | 2.1M | 10 |
| Rabies | 107 | 0.6M | 4 |
| Schistosomiasis | 94 | 1.7M | 4 |
| Trachoma | 91 | 0.1M | 4 |
| Lymphatic filariasis | 90 | 1.3M | 3 |
| **Onchocerciasis** | **34** | 1.3M | **1** |

**Interpretation:** Onchocerciasis (river blindness) has received only 34 clinical trials in 26 years—approximately 1 trial per year globally for a disease causing 1.3 million DALYs.

### 5.2 High-Burden Neglected Diseases

| Disease | Trials | DALYs | Gap |
|---------|--------|-------|-----|
| Malaria | 1,402 | 55.2M | For every 39,000 DALYs, 1 trial |
| Tuberculosis | 1,507 | 47.0M | For every 31,000 DALYs, 1 trial |
| Neonatal disorders | 11,118 | 186.4M | For every 17,000 DALYs, 1 trial |

**Compare to:** Breast cancer (101,576 trials for 20.6M DALYs = 1 trial per 203 DALYs)

## Part 6: Disease Category Analysis

### 6.1 Research Intensity by Category

| Category | Trials | DALYs (M) | Intensity | Assessment |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Neoplasms | 1,345,812 | 202.0 | 6,662 | Overresearched |
| Maternal disorders | 39,534 | 12.3 | 3,210 | High |

| NTDs and Malaria | 51,689 | 69.2 | 747 | Moderate |
| Cardiovascular | 124,464 | 417.7 | 298 | Low |
| Respiratory infections | 59,113 | 347.2 | 170 | Low |
| Nutritional deficiencies | 7,252 | 44.1 | 164 | Low |
| Unintentional injuries | 4,434 | 43.8 | 101 | Very Low |
| **Neonatal disorders** | 11,118 | 186.4 | **60** | **Critical** |

**Interpretation:** Neonatal disorders have the lowest research intensity (60 trials/M DALY) despite being the 3rd highest burden category. This represents a **111x intensity gap** compared to cancer.

---

## Part 7: The "Double Jeopardy" Phenomenon

Diseases in the **upper-left quadrant** (high burden, few trials) face "double jeopardy"—they cause significant suffering AND receive inadequate research attention.

### 7.1 Double Jeopardy Diseases (>50M DALYs, <15,000 trials)

| Disease | DALYs | Trials | GS Priority |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| COVID-19 | 212.0M | 9,239 | Yes |
| Ischemic heart disease | 188.4M | 13,654 | No |
| Neonatal disorders | 186.4M | 11,118 | Yes |
| Stroke | 160.5M | 18,444 | No |
| Lower respiratory infections | 82.5M | 45,810 | Yes |
| COPD | 79.8M | 7,672 | No |
| Diabetes mellitus | 78.9M | 23,548 | No |
| Low back pain | 70.2M | 24,572 | No |
| Road injuries | 65.1M | 19,743 | Yes |
| Diarrheal diseases | 59.0M | 49,696 | Yes |
| Malaria | 55.2M | 1,402 | Yes |

## Part 8: Comparison with Biobank Analysis

### 8.1 Discovery vs Translation Gap

| Metric | Biobanks (Discovery) | Clinical Trials (Translation) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| HIC:LMIC ratio | 57.8:1 (publications) | 2.5:1 (trial sites) |
| Cancer focus | 42% of publications | 61.5% of trials |
| GS priority share | ~15% | 20.3% |
| Temporal trend | Improving | **Worsening** |

**Key Insight:** While geographic concentration is better in clinical trials (2.5:1 vs 57.8:1), the disease focus is *worse* (61.5% cancer vs 42%). This suggests trials are accessible globally but research priorities remain skewed.

### 8.2 Consistent Neglect Pattern

Diseases neglected in BOTH biobank research AND clinical trials:
- Malaria
- Tuberculosis
- Neonatal disorders
- Neglected tropical diseases
- Mental disorders (anxiety, depression)

## Part 9: Figures and Their Narrative

### Figure CT1: HEIM-CT Framework
**Story:** Extends HEIM from discovery (biobanks) to translation (clinical trials), introducing the Clinical Trial Equity Index (CTEI).

### Figure CT2: Research Intensity Disparity
**Story:** Side-by-side contrast showing cancers receive 10,000-30,000 trials/M DALY while high-burden diseases receive 25-100. The 100-1000x gap is the central message.

### Figure CT3: Global South Priority Diseases
**Story:** All 30 GS priority diseases on one chart, colored by neglect severity. Nine diseases (dark red) have <500 trials in 26 years.

### Figure CT4: Geographic Concentration
**Story:** 71% of trial sites in HICs despite 85% of disease burden in LMICs. US alone = 25% of global trials.

### Figure CT5: Temporal Trends
**Story:** Trial volume grew 15.5x but GS priority share DECLINED 12.3 percentage points. The system is getting worse, not better.

### Figure CT6: Double Jeopardy
**Story:** Scatter plot reveals diseases that are doubly disadvantaged—high burden AND low research. Malaria and neonatal disorders are poster children.

### Figure CT7: Disease Category Coverage
**Story:** Neoplasms dominate. Neonatal disorders have the lowest intensity despite being 3rd in burden.

### Figure CT8: Top 15 High-Burden Diseases
**Story:** Shows exactly how many trials the world's most burdensome diseases receive. Makes the disparity visceral.

## Part 10: Discussion Points for Paper

### 10.1 Why Does This Matter?

1. **Clinical trials determine treatment availability.** Diseases without trials won't have approved therapies.

2. **The gap persists across the research pipeline.** From biobanks to trials, Global South diseases face systematic neglect.

3. **It's getting worse, not better.** Despite 15x growth in trial volume, priority share has declined.

### 10.2 Root Causes to Discuss

1. **Market incentives:** Pharmaceutical companies prioritize diseases in wealthy markets
2. **Regulatory pathways:** FDA/EMA approval drives trial location
3. **Infrastructure:** Clinical trial sites require hospitals, trained staff, regulatory frameworks
4. **Funding sources:** NIH, Wellcome, Gates Foundation priorities

### 10.3 Policy Recommendations

1. **Mandate burden-proportional allocation** for public funding agencies
2. **Tax incentives** for clinical trials on neglected diseases
3. **Regional trial networks** in Africa, South Asia, Latin America
4. **WHO oversight** of global trial equity metrics

### 10.4 Limitations to Acknowledge

1. ClinicalTrials.gov bias toward US-registered trials
2. Disease mapping imprecision (conditions→GBD categories)
3. Trial quality not assessed (only volume)
4. DALYs are estimates, not direct measurements

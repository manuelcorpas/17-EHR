IntroductionThe global genomics research enterprise faces a fundamental equity challenge. Despite representing approximately 85% of the world's population, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) contribute less than 10% of participants across genome-wide association studies (GWAS), pharmacogenomics research, direct-to-consumer genomics, and clinical trials.??? This disparity has far-reaching consequences for the generalisability and clinical utility of precision medicine approaches.The consequences of this representation gap are increasingly well-documented. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) developed primarily in European-ancestry populations show reduced predictive accuracy when applied to other populations, with performance decrements of 50% or greater reported in African-ancestry cohorts.??? Variant pathogenicity assessments in clinical databases such as ClinVar exhibit systematic biases toward well-studied populations, with variants common in African and Asian populations disproportionately classified as 'variants of uncertain significance'.??? These are not merely academic concerns; they represent systematic barriers to delivering equitable precision medicine globally.Global health organisations, including the World Health Organization, have increasingly called for measurable frameworks to track progress toward equitable genomic research.? A recent WHO report examining 6,513 genomic clinical studies conducted between 1990 and 2024 found that high-income countries (HICs) accounted for 68% of all studies, while low-income countries (LICs) contributed less than 0.5% (Figure 1B).?? The top 10 countries alone accounted for approximately 70% of global genomic clinical research output, with China (1,420 studies) and the United States (980 studies) dominating the landscape (Figure 2). However, a significant methodological gap remains: while the problem of underrepresentation has been extensively documented, no standardised framework exists to quantify research equity at the biobank level, benchmark institutions against global health priorities, or track progress over time.Biobanks represent critical infrastructure for genomic research, linking biological samples with electronic health records and enabling the large-scale studies necessary for genomic discovery.????? The geographic distribution of biobank capacity, however, mirrors broader inequities in research infrastructure. High-income countries host the majority of large-scale biobanks with comprehensive phenotyping and genomic data, while LMICs face systematic challenges including limited funding, infrastructure constraints, and reduced access to global research networks.This study introduces the Health Equity Informative Metrics (HEIM) framework to address this measurement gap (Figure 1A). HEIM operationalises equity assessment by comparing biobank research output against global disease burden measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.?? HEIM treats equity as an engineering problem amenable to systematic measurement, tracking, and targeted intervention.We present findings from the first comprehensive HEIM analysis, examining 75,356 publications from 27 biobanks across 19 countries. Our objectives were to: (1) quantify the alignment between biobank research output and global disease burden; (2) identify diseases with critical research gaps despite high burden; (3) benchmark individual biobanks using standardised equity metrics; and (4) characterise regional disparities in research capacity. These baseline measurements establish a foundation for monitoring progress and informing strategic investments in genomic research equity.MethodsData SourcesPublication DataWe retrieved publications linked to 27 biobanks from PubMed using the NCBI Entrez API. Biobank-specific queries were constructed using institution names, acronyms, and known variants (full query strings available in Supplementary Materials). The search period spanned January 2000 to December 2025. Each publication's Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were extracted and mapped to Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 disease categories using a manually curated mapping dictionary validated on a subset of 500 publications (concordance: 85.2%).Disease Burden DataDisability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.?? DALYs combine years of life lost (YLL) due to premature mortality with years lived with disability (YLD), providing a comprehensive measure of disease burden. We used global, all-age, both-sexes estimates for the 179 disease categories included in our analysis.Biobank SelectionWe selected 27 biobanks based on three criteria: (1) availability of linked electronic health records enabling disease phenotyping; (2) retrievable publication record in PubMed; and (3) geographic diversity across WHO regions. We acknowledge that these criteria privilege large, well-established institutions with English-language publication records; smaller regional biobanks and those publishing primarily in non-English journals may be underrepresented. The selected biobanks span 19 countries across five WHO regions (Table 1).Core Metric DefinitionsThe HEIM framework comprises three core components that together quantify research equity (Figure 1A): Gap Severity (mismatch between research output and disease burden), Burden Miss (high-burden diseases with inadequate coverage), and Capacity Penalty (underutilisation of research capacity in underrepresented settings).Burden ScoreThe Burden Score quantifies the global health importance of each disease category using a logarithmic transformation to prevent high-burden conditions from dominating the analysis:Burden Score = log??(DALYs + 1) ? 10Gap ScoreThe Gap Score measures the mismatch between disease burden and research attention:Gap Score = Burden Score ? (1 - Research Coverage)where Research Coverage is the normalised publication count relative to the maximum observed across all diseases. Gap Scores range from 0-100, with higher values indicating larger gaps. Gap severity was classified as: Critical (>70), High (50-70), Moderate (30-50), or Low (<30).Equity Alignment Score (EAS)The EAS provides an overall assessment of how well a biobank's research portfolio aligns with global disease burden:EAS = f(Gap, Burden, Capacity) = 100 - (Weighted Gap Penalty + Critical Gap Penalty)Scores range from 0-100 and are categorised as: Strong (³80), Moderate (60-79), Weak (40-59), or Poor (<40). EAS scoring uses global DALYs rather than region-specific burden; this is a deliberate normative choice to assess how well each biobank serves global rather than local health priorities. The category thresholds are initially heuristic; future iterations will refine boundaries based on empirical distributions.Equity RatioThe equity ratio compares research intensity (publications per DALY) between high-income country (HIC) and low- and middle-income country (LMIC) biobanks:Equity Ratio = (Publications_HIC / DALYs_HIC) / (Publications_LMIC / DALYs_LMIC)A ratio of 1.0 would indicate perfect equity; higher values indicate greater HIC advantage.Validation and Sensitivity AnalysesWe conducted several sensitivity analyses to assess robustness: (1) restricting to publications from 2015-2025 only; (2) excluding the two largest biobanks (eMERGE Network, UK Biobank); (3) using alternative burden metrics (mortality alone, prevalence alone); and (4) varying MeSH-to-GBD mapping stringency. The primary equity ratio finding was robust across all variations (ratio >100:1 in all scenarios).Data Availability and ReproducibilityAll analysis code, mapping dictionaries, and aggregated data are available at the HEIM Equity Tool (https://manuelcorpas.github.io/17-EHR/). Raw publication data are derived from PubMed and subject to NLM terms of use. Disease burden data are available from the IHME Global Health Data Exchange.Role of the Funding SourceThe funders had no role in study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, or writing of the manuscript.

ResultsOverview of DatasetWe analysed 75,356 PubMed-indexed publications from 27 biobanks across 19 countries (Table 1). Publications were mapped to 179 disease categories based on MeSH term annotations. The included biobanks span five WHO regions, with representation from both high-income (n=20) and low- and middle-income (n=7) countries.Regional Distribution of Research OutputResearch output was highly concentrated in specific regions (Table 2). The Americas region contributed 65.4% of all publications (49,264 of 75,356), driven primarily by US-based biobanks including the eMERGE Network (47,755 publications) and Million Veteran Program (327 publications). Europe contributed 32.4% (24,445 publications), with the UK Biobank (13,341 publications) and deCODE Genetics (5,604 publications) as leading contributors.Critically, Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, and South-East Asia combined contributed less than 1% of total publications (378 of 75,356). This regional concentration is the primary driver of the observed equity disparities. The geographic distribution of genomic clinical studies more broadly, as documented by the WHO (Figure 2), shows a similar pattern: China and the United States together account for over 2,400 studies, while entire regions of Africa and South America remain underrepresented.Equity RatioWithin our 27-biobank sample, HIC biobanks produced substantially higher research output per DALY compared to LMIC biobanks (equity ratio: 322:1; Figure 1C). This ratio indicates that for every unit of disease burden, HIC biobanks generated 322 times more research output than LMIC biobanks.The distribution of genomic research output by income group (Figure 1B) illustrates this disparity: HICs account for 68% of genomic clinical studies but bear a smaller proportion of global disease burden, while LICs contribute only 0.5% of studies despite bearing approximately 15% of global burden (Figure 1D).Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of this finding. When restricting to 2015-2025 publications only, the ratio remained high (284:1). Excluding the two largest biobanks (eMERGE Network, UK Biobank) yielded a ratio of 156:1. Using mortality alone as the burden metric produced a ratio of 289:1. While the precise value varies with methodological choices, the fundamental pattern of substantial inequity was consistent across all analyses (ratio >100:1 in all scenarios).Disease-Level Research GapsOf 179 disease categories analysed, 6 (3.4%) showed critical research gaps, 17 (9.5%) showed high gaps, 48 (26.8%) showed moderate gaps, and 108 (60.3%) showed low gaps (adequate coverage). The 23 diseases with critical or high gaps represent priority targets for equity-focused investment.Six disease categories exhibited critical gaps (Gap Score >70), defined as conditions with substantial global burden but minimal or zero mapped publications (Table 3):¥ Drowning: 15.7 million DALYs, 0 mapped publications¥ Iodine deficiency: 2.3 million DALYs, 10 publications¥ Viral skin diseases: 4.2 million DALYs, 1 publication¥ Cysticercosis: 1.2 million DALYs, 2 publications¥ Paralytic ileus and intestinal obstruction: 6.7 million DALYs, 5 publications¥ Scabies: 5.3 million DALYs, 6 publicationsInterpretation note: The zero publications for drowning reflects a property of our pipeline (PubMed queries, MeSH mapping) rather than a literal claim that no genomics research exists on drowning-related outcomes. Nevertheless, the near-complete absence of biobank engagement with this high-burden condition illustrates how research agendas can become disconnected from global health priorities.Biobank-Level Equity AlignmentEquity Alignment Scores ranged from 0.2 (EPIGEN-Brazil) to 98.3 (eMERGE Network). The distribution was heavily skewed toward lower scores (Table 4):¥ Strong (EAS ³80): 2 biobanks (7.4%)¥ Moderate (EAS 60-79): 2 biobanks (7.4%)¥ Weak (EAS 40-59): 4 biobanks (14.8%)¥ Poor (EAS <40): 19 biobanks (70.4%)The concentration in the 'Poor' category reflects systemic factors including resource constraints, infrastructure limitations, and research agendas driven by local rather than global priorities. Notably, several LMIC biobanks with low EAS scores are relatively recently established; their scores may improve as their research programmes mature. Complete biobank rankings are provided in Table 1.Global South BiobanksSeven biobanks in our sample serve Global South populations (Table 1, GS column). Despite resource constraints, several are emerging as important contributors to genomic equity:¥ China Kadoorie Biobank: 516 publications covering 109 diseases (EAS: 38.7)¥ Qatar Biobank: 174 publications covering 72 diseases (EAS: 17.4)¥ H3Africa Consortium: 139 publications covering 43 diseases (EAS: 16.8)¥ AWI-Gen: 60 publications covering 31 diseases (EAS: 11.0)These biobanks face systematic challenges including limited funding and infrastructure constraints, but provide critical representation for populations historically excluded from genomic research.
DiscussionPrincipal FindingsThis study introduces the HEIM framework for quantifying equity in global biobank research and presents baseline measurements from 27 biobanks across 19 countries. Our principal findings are threefold. First, we observed a substantial disparity in research intensity between HIC and LMIC biobanks (equity ratio: 322:1 within our sample; Figure 1C), indicating that the distribution of biobank research capacity is profoundly misaligned with global disease burden. Second, we identified 23 disease categories (13%) with critical or high-severity research gaps despite substantial global burden (Table 3), representing priority targets for equity-focused investment. Third, only 4 of 27 biobanks (15%) achieved 'Strong' or 'Moderate' equity alignment scores (Table 4), highlighting systemic underperformance across the global biobank landscape.Comparison with Prior LiteratureOur findings are consistent with prior documentation of ancestry bias in genomic research. Popejoy and Fullerton reported that individuals of European descent comprised 79% of GWAS participants despite representing approximately 16% of the global population.? Sirugo et al. documented persistent underrepresentation of African populations across multiple genomic research modalities.? The recent WHO report on genomic clinical studies (1990-2024) found that 68% of all studies were conducted in high-income countries, with the top 10 countries accounting for approximately 70% of global output (Figures 1-2).?? Our contribution extends this literature by providing disease-resolved, DALY-normalised equity metrics at the biobank level, enabling benchmarking and progress tracking.The observed equity ratio should be interpreted carefully. While the 322:1 figure reflects the specific biobanks and time period in our analysis, sensitivity analyses confirm that the fundamental inequity is robust: the ratio exceeds 100:1 across all reasonable methodological variations. The precise value matters less than the consistent finding of profound disparity.Implications for Precision MedicineThe research gaps identified here have direct implications for precision medicine. Conditions prevalent in LMICs but understudied in biobank research will have weaker evidence bases for genomic medicine applications. Polygenic risk scores developed without adequate representation from diverse populations will underperform in those populations.??? Variant pathogenicity databases will contain systematic blind spots for understudied ancestries.??? The HEIM framework provides a mechanism for identifying and tracking these gaps, enabling targeted interventions.Interpreting Critical Disease GapsThe critical gaps identified (Table 3), including drowning, iodine deficiency, and cysticercosis, warrant careful interpretation. Zero mapped publications for drowning does not indicate complete absence of relevant research; rather, it reflects the limitations of our PubMed-based, MeSH-mapped pipeline. Some high-burden conditions may have limited genomic contributions regardless of research effort. Nevertheless, the pattern of critical gaps is informative: conditions disproportionately affecting LMICs receive systematically less attention from the global biobank research enterprise.Why 70% of Biobanks Score 'Poor'The concentration of biobanks in the 'Poor' EAS category (Table 4) reflects structural factors rather than individual institutional failures:¥ Resource constraints: LMIC biobanks operate with a fraction of the funding available to HIC counterparts¥ Infrastructure gaps: Genomic sequencing, computing infrastructure, and trained personnel remain scarce in many regions¥ Network effects: Research collaborations, journal access, and funding opportunities cluster in established centres¥ Local versus global priorities: Biobanks naturally focus on conditions prevalent in their source populationsAddressing these systemic factors requires coordinated action from funders, institutions, and policymakers. The HEIM framework provides measurement infrastructure to track whether interventions are effective.LimitationsSeveral limitations should inform interpretation of these findings:¥ Publication coverage: Our analysis is limited to PubMed-indexed publications, potentially undercounting research published in regional journals or non-English languages¥ MeSH mapping accuracy: Automated mapping from MeSH terms to GBD categories achieved 85% concordance with manual classification; some misclassification is expected, particularly for multimorbid conditions¥ Biobank selection: The 27 biobanks analysed represent a convenience sample of major institutions; hundreds of smaller biobanks are not captured¥ Temporal confounding: Cumulative publication counts advantage established biobanks; recently established biobanks may appear to underperform despite rapid growth¥ Quality versus quantity: Publication counts do not capture research quality, clinical impact, or translation to practice¥ Normative choices: Using global rather than regional DALYs reflects a specific equity perspective; alternative framings are possibleFuture versions of the HEIM framework will address these limitations through expanded data sources, improved mapping algorithms, and additional metrics capturing research quality and impact.Policy ImplicationsThe HEIM framework has several potential applications for policy and practice. Research funders could incorporate equity metrics into grant evaluation criteria, weighting proposals that address high-gap diseases or involve LMIC biobanks. Biobanks could use the framework for strategic planning, identifying underserved disease areas within their capacity. Policymakers could reference equity metrics when allocating resources for genomic research infrastructure.We emphasise that HEIM metrics are best viewed as a platform for piloting equity-aware mechanisms, to be refined as evidence accumulates on their impact. The thresholds and weights used in our scoring represent starting points rather than definitive standards.ConclusionsThe HEIM framework provides a standardised, reproducible approach to quantifying equity in global biobank research (Figure 1A). Our analysis of 27 biobanks reveals substantial disparities in how research capacity is distributed relative to global disease burden, with HIC biobanks producing substantially higher research output per DALY than LMIC counterparts (Tables 1-2; Figure 1B-C). These findings establish baseline measurements for tracking progress toward more equitable genomic research.Closing the equity gap requires coordinated action across the research ecosystem: targeted funding for LMIC biobanks, capacity-building investments, equitable collaboration frameworks, and metrics that reward equity-aligned research. The HEIM framework provides the measurement infrastructure to track whether such interventions are working.Future work will expand the HEIM framework to include additional biobanks, refine mapping methodologies, and develop complementary metrics for research quality and clinical impact. Annual updates to the HEIM Equity Index will enable stakeholders to monitor progress and identify emerging priorities. The interactive HEIM Equity Tool (https://manuelcorpas.github.io/17-EHR/) provides real-time access to these metrics for researchers, funders, and policymakers.

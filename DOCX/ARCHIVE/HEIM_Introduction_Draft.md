## INTRODUCTION (487 words)

The global burden of disease falls disproportionately on low- and middle-income countries, which bear 93% of the world's preventable mortality yet receive a fraction of biomedical research investment [1,2]. This disparity—often termed the "10/90 gap," where less than 10% of global health research addresses conditions affecting 90% of the world's population—has persisted for over three decades despite sustained advocacy and targeted funding initiatives [3,4]. While health outcome inequities are extensively documented, the structural biases embedded within research infrastructure itself remain poorly characterized and inadequately measured.

Research inequity operates at multiple stages of the scientific enterprise. At the discovery stage, biobanks and cohort studies generate the foundational data for genomic medicine, yet these resources concentrate overwhelmingly in high-income countries and predominantly European-ancestry populations [5,6]. At the translation stage, clinical trials determine which interventions reach patients, yet trial sites cluster in wealthy nations regardless of where disease burden is greatest [7,8]. At the knowledge stage, the scientific literature shapes research priorities and enables cross-disciplinary learning, yet we lack systematic methods to assess whether certain diseases occupy marginalized positions in the semantic landscape of published science.

Previous efforts to quantify research equity have focused on single dimensions: publication counts relative to disease burden [9], clinical trial registration by geography [10], or funding allocation across disease categories [11]. While valuable, these approaches cannot capture compounding disadvantage—the phenomenon whereby diseases neglected at one stage face systematic barriers at subsequent stages. A disease absent from major biobanks generates fewer genomic discoveries, attracts fewer clinical trials, accumulates a smaller and more isolated body of literature, and consequently remains neglected in perpetuity. Breaking this cycle requires a unified framework that spans the full research lifecycle and identifies where interventions are most needed.

Here we introduce the Health Equity Informative Metrics (HEIM) framework, a three-dimensional analysis of research equity encompassing Discovery (biobank research output), Translation (clinical trial geography), and Knowledge (semantic structure of scientific literature). We analyzed 70 biobanks from the International Health Cohorts Consortium across 29 countries, 2.2 million clinical trials with 770,000 geolocated site records, and 13.1 million PubMed abstracts spanning 25 years (2000–2025). Using the Global Burden of Disease 2021 taxonomy as a common ontology, we mapped research activity across 176 disease categories and developed novel metrics—including Semantic Isolation Index, Knowledge Transfer Potential, and Research Clustering Coefficient—to quantify patterns invisible to conventional bibliometric analysis.

Our analysis addresses four questions fundamental to global health equity: (1) How equitably is biobank-derived research distributed relative to global disease burden? (2) Does clinical trial infrastructure reflect the geography of disease prevalence? (3) Do neglected diseases occupy isolated positions in the semantic landscape of biomedical research? (4) Which diseases show compounding disadvantage across all three dimensions, and what characterizes them? The answers reveal systematic structural barriers that perpetuate health inequity—and provide quantitative targets for research investment to address them.

## PARAGRAPH-BY-PARAGRAPH BREAKDOWN

### Paragraph 1: The Problem (98 words)
**Purpose:** Establish the global health inequity problem and its persistence
**Key points:**
- 93% preventable mortality in LMICs
- 10/90 gap has persisted 30+ years
- Outcome inequities documented, but infrastructure biases not measured
**Citations needed:** [1] GBD 2021, [2] WHO statistics, [3,4] 10/90 gap papers

### Paragraph 2: Multi-stage Research Inequity (108 words)
**Purpose:** Show that inequity operates at every research stage
**Key points:**
- Discovery: Biobanks concentrated in HICs, European ancestry
- Translation: Trial sites cluster in wealthy nations
- Knowledge: No methods to assess semantic marginalization
**Citations needed:** [5,6] Biobank diversity papers, [7,8] Clinical trial equity papers

### Paragraph 3: Limitations of Current Approaches (96 words)
**Purpose:** Critique single-dimension frameworks
**Key points:**
- Previous work: publication counts, trial geography, funding allocation
- Cannot capture compounding disadvantage
- Cycle of neglect: no biobank → no trials → isolated literature → continued neglect
**Citations needed:** [9] Publication equity studies, [10] Trial registration analyses, [11] Funding allocation studies

### Paragraph 4: Our Contribution — HEIM (104 words)
**Purpose:** Introduce framework and scale
**Key points:**
- Three dimensions: Discovery, Translation, Knowledge
- Scale: 70 biobanks, 2.2M trials, 13.1M papers
- GBD 2021 as common ontology (176 diseases)
- Novel metrics: SII, KTP, RCC
**Citations needed:** GBD 2021, IHCC, AACT database

### Paragraph 5: Research Questions (81 words)
**Purpose:** State the four key questions
**Key points:**
1. Biobank equity vs disease burden?
2. Trial geography vs disease prevalence?
3. Semantic isolation of neglected diseases?
4. Compounding disadvantage — which diseases, what characteristics?
**Closing:** Answers reveal structural barriers AND provide quantitative targets

## ALTERNATIVE OPENING HOOKS

**Option A (Current — Statistical):**
"The global burden of disease falls disproportionately on low- and middle-income countries, which bear 93% of the world's preventable mortality..."

**Option B (Human):**
"A child born in sub-Saharan Africa is fifteen times more likely to die before age five than one born in Western Europe, yet biomedical research priorities reflect the inverse distribution..."

**Option C (Provocative):**
"Global health research infrastructure was not designed to serve global health. It was designed to serve wealthy nations, and three decades of equity initiatives have failed to change this fundamental architecture..."

**Option D (Question):**
"Why do neglected tropical diseases remain neglected? The answer lies not only in funding disparities but in structural barriers embedded within the research enterprise itself..."

- Introduces novel concepts (compounding disadvantage, semantic isolation)
- Ends with clear research questions

**Potential concerns:**
- "Semantic isolation" may need brief definition for general audience
- Could add more emotional weight (human impact)
- May want to name specific diseases earlier to ground the reader

**Style notes:**
- Active voice throughout
- Short, punchy sentences where possible
- Technical terms introduced with context
- No jargon without explanation

## DISCUSSION (712 words)

Our analysis reveals that health research inequity is not merely a matter of funding disparities but reflects deep structural biases embedded across the entire research enterprise. The HEIM framework demonstrates that neglected diseases—particularly those affecting the Global South—face compounding disadvantage: they are absent from major biobanks, underrepresented in clinical trials, and semantically isolated in the scientific literature. This triple burden creates self-reinforcing cycles that perpetuate neglect regardless of individual funding initiatives.

The finding that neglected tropical diseases exhibit 20% higher semantic isolation than other conditions has important implications. Semantic isolation indicates not only fewer publications but qualitatively different positioning in the knowledge landscape—these diseases are disconnected from the methodological innovations, therapeutic paradigms, and conceptual frameworks that drive progress in mainstream biomedicine. A disease that is semantically isolated cannot easily benefit from advances in adjacent fields, cannot attract researchers trained in well-resourced areas, and cannot leverage the infrastructure of interconnected research communities. The contrast with HIV/AIDS is instructive: sustained global investment over four decades has not only increased publication volume but fundamentally integrated HIV research into immunology, virology, global health, and implementation science, reducing its semantic isolation despite its origins as a disease of poverty.

### Implications for Research Funders

HEIM provides quantitative targets that can guide strategic investment. Funders seeking to maximize equity impact should prioritize diseases with high Unified Scores, particularly those where investment might reduce semantic isolation by connecting neglected disease research to established methodological communities. Our data suggest that the current portfolio of major funders—reflected in biobank output and trial registration—remains substantially misaligned with global disease burden. The persistence of this gap over 25 years, despite explicit equity mandates from organizations including the Wellcome Trust, Gates Foundation, and National Institutes of Health, indicates that incremental adjustments are insufficient. Structural change may require dedicated funding streams for neglected diseases with mandated cross-disciplinary collaboration to reduce semantic isolation.

### Implications for Biobank Consortia

The concentration of research output in a single biobank—UK Biobank accounts for 36% of recent publications—creates both opportunity and risk. On one hand, UK Biobank demonstrates that well-resourced, accessible infrastructure generates substantial scientific return. On the other hand, this concentration means that diseases not represented in UK Biobank's primarily European, primarily healthy-at-recruitment population remain systematically understudied. The IHCC and similar consortia should consider explicit equity metrics when evaluating member contributions, potentially weighting research on high-burden, high-gap diseases more heavily than incremental contributions to well-studied conditions. Our Equity Alignment Score provides a ready framework for such evaluation.

### Implications for Clinical Trial Design

The 2.5-fold concentration of trial sites in high-income countries persists despite decades of recognition that trials should be conducted in populations who will use the resulting interventions. Regulatory frameworks, institutional capacity, and investigator networks all contribute to this concentration. Our data suggest that even for diseases predominantly affecting the Global South, the majority of trial infrastructure remains in the Global North. This mismatch raises questions about generalizability, implementation feasibility, and research justice. Trial sponsors and regulators should consider geographic representation as a design criterion, not merely an aspiration.

### Limitations

Several limitations warrant consideration. First, PubMed coverage favors English-language journals and may underrepresent research published in regional journals or languages other than English. Second, clinical trial registration completeness varies by country and has improved over time, potentially affecting temporal trend estimates. Third, our biobank analysis relies on publication counts, which may underestimate research activity that does not result in indexed publications. Fourth, the Unified Score weights dimensions equally; alternative weightings could alter rankings, though sensitivity analyses (Extended Data) suggest our conclusions are robust. Finally, our analysis establishes associations between disease characteristics and research neglect but cannot establish causation.

### Future Directions

HEIM provides a foundation for prospective monitoring of research equity. Integration with funding databases (NIH Reporter, Dimensions, OpenAlex) would enable analysis of investment-to-output relationships. Expansion to preprints and grey literature would capture research currently invisible to PubMed-based analyses. Development of intervention studies—testing whether targeted investments reduce semantic isolation—would move from diagnosis to demonstrated solutions. We have made our interactive dashboard publicly available to enable ongoing monitoring by funders, consortia, and policymakers committed to closing the global health research equity gap.

- Specific, actionable recommendations for three stakeholder groups
- HIV/AIDS example provides hope (investment can work)
- Limitations are honest but not undermining
- Ends with forward momentum (public dashboard, future studies)

**What to avoid:**
- ❌ Restating Results numbers in detail
- ❌ Overclaiming causation
- ❌ Generic "more research needed"
- ❌ Apologetic tone about limitations

**Nature Medicine expectations:**
- Policy relevance emphasized
- Actionable insights for specific audiences
- Honest limitations section
- Clear "so what" for global health

## ALTERNATIVE CLOSING PARAGRAPHS

**Option A (Current):** Future directions focus
> "HEIM provides a foundation for prospective monitoring..."

**Option B (Call to action):**
> "The structural inequities revealed by HEIM are not inevitable. HIV/AIDS demonstrates that sustained, strategic investment can transform a neglected disease into an integrated research field. The question is not whether such transformation is possible for neglected tropical diseases but whether the global research community has the will to make it happen. HEIM provides the metrics; what remains is the commitment."

**Option C (Policy focus):**
> "As the global health community prepares for the next pandemic, the World Health Organization's R&D Blueprint, and the G20 health agenda, HEIM offers an evidence base for prioritization. Diseases that score highest on our Unified metric—lymphatic filariasis, cysticercosis, dengue, malaria—should receive proportionally greater investment until their structural disadvantage is remedied. We have made our framework publicly available to support this effort."

# HEIM v2 Strategic Intelligence

**Document Purpose**: Strategic positioning and development intelligence for HEIM v2
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-10
**Classification**: Internal strategy document

---

## Professional Positioning

### Identity Statement
- **Title**: Professor of Genomic Equity
- **Operating Domain**: Where data, policy, and populations meet
- **Core Function**: Translating complex intersections into globally accountable standards

### Non-Negotiables
| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Publication autonomy | Western academic credibility requires independent publication pipeline |
| HEIM institutional independence | Prevents capture; maintains third-party validator status |
| Western academic visibility | Credibility transfer to emerging programmes |
| Control of time and authorship | Strategic resource allocation |

---

## Strategic Positioning Framework

### Objective
Position as someone for whom a **bespoke role** makes sense — not a standard faculty appointment.

### Target Role Architecture
A strategic faculty appointment with remit across:
- Genomics
- Data infrastructure
- Equity metrics
- National or international programmes

This is a **controlled power** scenario: institutional resources without institutional capture.

---

## Stakeholder Value Proposition

### What Problem Does HEIM Solve?

| Stakeholder Need | HEIM Delivers |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **National representativeness** | Benchmarks against 70+ IHCC cohorts |
| **Global legitimacy** | Third-party equity validation |
| **Accountability metrics** | Standardized, citable framework |
| **Burden-aligned research** | Gap identification and prioritization |

### Key Statistic
**57.8:1** — HIC biobanks produce 57.8× more research per DALY than LMIC biobanks. This single number encapsulates the equity gap HEIM makes visible.

---

## What Makes This Role Uniquely Yours

**Not "Professor of Genomics"** — that's a category anyone can claim.

**You are the architect of the accountability layer for global genomic research.**

Supporting evidence:
- Built the only operational equity metric adopted by IHCC-aligned cohorts
- Publish in Western venues (Annual Review of Biomedical Data Science, medRxiv)
- Institutionally independent (cannot be accused of captured metrics)
- You bring the standard; they bring data and funding

---

## Internal Answers (Do Not Volunteer)

### 1. What problem do they have that HEIM solves?
- National representativeness
- Global legitimacy
- Standardized benchmarking
- Equity credential validation

### 2. What do you refuse to give up?
- HEIM independence
- International publication autonomy
- Continued Western-facing visibility
- Control of time and authorship

### 3. What would make this role uniquely yours?
Not "Professor of X" — but **architect of Y**
- The accountability infrastructure
- The equity standard
- The benchmarking framework

---

## HEIM v2 Development Strategy

### Current State (v1/v3.0)
- 70 IHCC biobanks analyzed
- 38,595 publications (2000-2025)
- 179 GBD disease categories
- Primary metric: Equity Alignment Score (EAS)
- Publication: Annual Review of Biomedical Data Science + medRxiv v2

### Limitations to Address in v2

| Limitation | Impact | Required Evolution |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Publication count as proxy | Volume ≠ impact; funders challenge this | Add citation/impact metrics |
| No intervention tracking | Can diagnose but can't show what works | Build longitudinal delta tracking |
| Static annual snapshots | Not a living governance tool | Real-time API infrastructure |
| Single-investigator perception | Limits institutional adoption | Establish governance structure |

### HEIM v2 Product Architecture

| Component | Function | Primary Stakeholder |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **HEIM-Index** | Live API for real-time benchmarking | Funders (Wellcome, NIH, Gates) |
| **HEIM-Audit** | Institutional equity reports | IHCC members, national programmes |
| **HEIM-Policy** | Threshold standards for certification | WHO, GA4GH, health ministries |
| **HEIM-Tracker** | Longitudinal intervention impact | LMIC capacity funders |

### Strategic Design Principles

1. **Institutions subscribe — they don't own**
   - HEIM generates their reports
   - You control the methodology
   - Independence maintained

2. **The standard precedes institutional adoption**
   - HEIM should be cited by WHO/GA4GH/Wellcome
   - Before any single institution can claim it
   - Establishes you as the authority

3. **Your name is inseparable from the framework**
   - Corpas Framework
   - HEIM Index
   - Eponymous nomenclature that travels with you

---

## Negotiation Readiness

### If Asked "What Would You Need?"
- Protected time for international publication and HEIM development
- No institutional claim on HEIM IP or governance
- Title reflecting cross-cutting remit (not departmental)
- Flexibility for continued Western collaboration

### Conversation Objective
**Not to get an offer.**

**To position yourself as someone for whom a bespoke role makes sense.**

## Next Development Priorities

1. [ ] Design technical architecture for HEIM v2 as platform (APIs, data pipelines, governance)
2. [ ] Map stakeholder landscape — who adopts standards, what do they need
3. [ ] Identify "signature product" — the deliverable that makes HEIM synonymous with your name
4. [ ] Establish governance structure that preserves independence
5. [ ] Secure WHO/GA4GH citation before institutional partnerships

All of Us,39304265,"Global, regional, and national burden of stroke and its risk factors, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","Up-to-date estimates of stroke burden and attributable risks and their trends at global, regional, and national levels are essential for evidence-based health care, prevention, and resource allocation planning. We aimed to provide such estimates for the period 1990-2021. We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7·3 million [95% UI 6·6-7·8] deaths; 10·7% [9·8-11·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160·5 million [147·8-171·6] DALYs; 5·6% [5·0-6·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93·8 million (89·0-99·3) prevalent and 11·9 million (10·7-13·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65·3% (62·4-67·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28·8% (28·3-28·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5·8% (5·7-6·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88·2% [53·4-117·7]), high ambient temperature (72·4% [51·1 to 179·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32·1% [26·7-38·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23·4% [12·7-35·7]), low physical activity (11·3% [1·8-34·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6·7% [2·5-11·6]), lead exposure (6·5% [4·5-11·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5·3% [0·5-10·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

Many of these cohorts, however, are small, lack diversity, or do not provide comprehensive phenotype data. The All of Us Research Program plans to enroll a diverse group of at least 1 million persons in the United States in order to accelerate biomedical research and improve health. The program aims to make the research results accessible to participants, and it is developing new approaches to generate, access, and make data broadly available to approved researchers. All of Us opened for enrollment in May 2018 and currently enrolls participants 18 years of age or older from a network of more than 340 recruitment sites. Elements of the program protocol include health questionnaires, electronic health records (EHRs), physical measurements, the use of digital health technology, and the collection and analysis of biospecimens. As of July 2019, more than 175,000 participants had contributed biospecimens. More than 80% of these participants are from groups that have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research. EHR data on more than 112,000 participants from 34 sites have been collected. The All of Us data repository should permit researchers to take into account individual differences in lifestyle, socioeconomic factors, environment, and biologic characteristics in order to advance precision diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.","Denny, Joshua C; Rutter, Joni L; Goldstein, David B; Philippakis, Anthony; Smoller, Jordan W; Jenkins, Gwynne; Dishman, Eric",The New England journal of medicine,2019,Biological Specimen Banks; Biomedical Research; Cohort Studies; Datasets as Topic; Electronic Health Records; Health Surveys; Humans; Observational Studies as Topic; Precision Medicine; Research Design; United States,,"From the Departments of Biomedical Informatics and Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville (J.C.D.); the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (J.L.R.) and the All of Us Research Program (G.J., E.D.), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; the Institute for Genomic Medicine and Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York (D.B.G.); and the Broad Institute, Cambridge (A.P., J.W.S.), and the Center for Genomic Medicine and Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston (J.W.S.) - both in Massachusetts.; From the Departments of Biomedical Informatics and Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville (J.C.D.); the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (J.L.R.) and the All of Us Research Program (G.J., E.D.), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; the Institute for Genomic Medicine and Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York (D.B.G.); and the Broad Institute, Cambridge (A.P., J.W.S.), and the Center for Genomic Medicine and Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston (J.W.S.) - both in Massachusetts.; From the Departments of Biomedical Informatics and Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville (J.C.D.); the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (J.L.R.) and the All of Us Research Program (G.J., E.D.), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; the Institute for Genomic Medicine and Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York (D.B.G.); and the Broad Institute, Cambridge (A.P., J.W.S.), and the Center for Genomic Medicine and Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston (J.W.S.) - both in Massachusetts.; From the Departments of Biomedical Informatics and Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville (J.C.D.); the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (J.L.R.) and the All of Us Research Program (G.J., E.D.), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; the Institute for Genomic Medicine and Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York (D.B.G.); and the Broad Institute, Cambridge (A.P., J.W.S.), and the Center for Genomic Medicine and Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston (J.W.S.) - both in Massachusetts.; From the Departments of Biomedical Informatics and Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville (J.C.D.); the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (J.L.R.) and the All of Us Research Program (G.J., E.D.), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; the Institute for Genomic Medicine and Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York (D.B.G.); and the Broad Institute, Cambridge (A.P., J.W.S.), and the Center for Genomic Medicine and Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston (J.W.S.) - both in Massachusetts.; From the Departments of Biomedical Informatics and Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville (J.C.D.); the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (J.L.R.) and the All of Us Research Program (G.J., E.D.), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; the Institute for Genomic Medicine and Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York (D.B.G.); and the Broad Institute, Cambridge (A.P., J.W.S.), and the Center for Genomic Medicine and Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston (J.W.S.) - both in Massachusetts.; From the Departments of Biomedical Informatics and Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville (J.C.D.); the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (J.L.R.) and the All of Us Research Program (G.J., E.D.), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; the Institute for Genomic Medicine and Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York (D.B.G.); and the Broad Institute, Cambridge (A.P., J.W.S.), and the Center for Genomic Medicine and Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston (J.W.S.) - both in Massachusetts.",10.1056/NEJMsr1809937

All of Us,36621880,Returning integrated genomic risk and clinical recommendations: The eMERGE study.,"Assessing the risk of common, complex diseases requires consideration of clinical risk factors as well as monogenic and polygenic risks, which in turn may be reflected in family history. Returning risks to individuals and providers may influence preventive care or use of prophylactic therapies for those individuals at high genetic risk. To enable integrated genetic risk assessment, the eMERGE (electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics) network is enrolling 25,000 diverse individuals in a prospective cohort study across 10 sites. The network developed methods to return cross-ancestry polygenic risk scores, monogenic risks, family history, and clinical risk assessments via a genome-informed risk assessment (GIRA) report and will assess uptake of care recommendations after return of results. GIRAs include summary care recommendations for 11 conditions, education pages, and clinical laboratory reports. The return of high-risk GIRA to individuals and providers includes guidelines for care and lifestyle recommendations. Assembling the GIRA required infrastructure and workflows for ingesting and presenting content from multiple sources. Recruitment began in February 2022. Return of a novel report for communicating monogenic, polygenic, and family history-based risk factors will inform the benefits of integrated genetic risk assessment for routine health care.","Linder, Jodell E; Allworth, Aimee; Bland, Harris T; Caraballo, Pedro J; Chisholm, Rex L; Clayton, Ellen Wright; Crosslin, David R; Dikilitas, Ozan; DiVietro, Alanna; Esplin, Edward D; Forman, Sophie; Freimuth, Robert R; Gordon, Adam S; Green, Richard; Harden, Maegan V; Holm, Ingrid A; Jarvik, Gail P; Karlson, Elizabeth W; Labrecque, Sofia; Lennon, Niall J; Limdi, Nita A; Mittendorf, Kathleen F; Murphy, Shawn N; Orlando, Lori; Prows, Cynthia A; Rasmussen, Luke V; Rasmussen-Torvik, Laura; Rowley, Robb; Sawicki, Konrad Teodor; Schmidlen, Tara; Terek, Shannon; Veenstra, David; Velez Edwards, Digna R; Absher, Devin; Abul-Husn, Noura S; Alsip, Jorge; Bangash, Hana; Beasley, Mark; Below, Jennifer E; Berner, Eta S; Booth, James; Chung, Wendy K; Cimino, James J; Connolly, John; Davis, Patrick; Devine, Beth; Fullerton, Stephanie M; Guiducci, Candace; Habrat, Melissa L; Hain, Heather; Hakonarson, Hakon; Harr, Margaret; Haverfield, Eden; Hernandez, Valentina; Hoell, Christin; Horike-Pyne, Martha; Hripcsak, George; Irvin, Marguerite R; Kachulis, Christopher; Karavite, Dean; Kenny, Eimear E; Khan, Atlas; Kiryluk, Krzysztof; Korf, Bruce; Kottyan, Leah; Kullo, Iftikhar J; Larkin, Katie; Liu, Cong; Malolepsza, Edyta; Manolio, Teri A; May, Thomas; McNally, Elizabeth M; Mentch, Frank; Miller, Alexandra; Mooney, Sean D; Murali, Priyanka; Mutai, Brenda; Muthu, Naveen; Namjou, Bahram; Perez, Emma F; Puckelwartz, Megan J; Rakhra-Burris, Tejinder; Roden, Dan M; Rosenthal, Elisabeth A; Saadatagah, Seyedmohammad; Sabatello, Maya; Schaid, Dan J; Schultz, Baergen; Seabolt, Lynn; Shaibi, Gabriel Q; Sharp, Richard R; Shirts, Brian; Smith, Maureen E; Smoller, Jordan W; Sterling, Rene; Suckiel, Sabrina A; Thayer, Jeritt; Tiwari, Hemant K; Trinidad, Susan B; Walunas, Theresa; Wei, Wei-Qi; Wells, Quinn S; Weng, Chunhua; Wiesner, Georgia L; Wiley, Ken; Peterson, Josh F",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2023,Humans; Prospective Studies; Genome; Genomics; Risk Factors; Risk Assessment,Common variants; Family history; Genotyping; Monogenic risks; Polygenic risk scores,"Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.; Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics and Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.; Department of Internal Medicine and Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.; Center for Genetic Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.; Center for Biomedical Ethics and Society, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.; Division of Biomedical Informatics and Genomics, John W.

All of Us,39030265,Sleep patterns and risk of chronic disease as measured by long-term monitoring with commercial wearable devices in the All of Us Research Program.,"Poor sleep health is associated with increased all-cause mortality and incidence of many chronic conditions. Previous studies have relied on cross-sectional and self-reported survey data or polysomnograms, which have limitations with respect to data granularity, sample size and longitudinal information. Here, using objectively measured, longitudinal sleep data from commercial wearable devices linked to electronic health record data from the All of Us Research Program, we show that sleep patterns, including sleep stages, duration and regularity, are associated with chronic disease incidence. Of the 6,785 participants included in this study, 71% were female, 84% self-identified as white and 71% had a college degree; the median age was 50.2 years (interquartile range = 35.7, 61.5) and the median sleep monitoring period was 4.5 years (2.5, 6.5). We found that rapid eye movement sleep and deep sleep were inversely associated with the odds of incident atrial fibrillation and that increased sleep irregularity was associated with increased odds of incident obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, J-shaped associations were observed between average daily sleep duration and hypertension, major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. These findings show that sleep stages, duration and regularity are all important factors associated with chronic disease development and may inform evidence-based recommendations on healthy sleeping habits.","Zheng, Neil S; Annis, Jeffrey; Master, Hiral; Han, Lide; Gleichauf, Karla; Ching, Jack H; Nasser, Melody; Coleman, Peyton; Desine, Stacy; Ruderfer, Douglas M; Hernandez, John; Schneider, Logan D; Brittain, Evan L",Nature medicine,2024,Humans; Female; Wearable Electronic Devices; Middle Aged; Male; Chronic Disease; Adult; Sleep; United States; Polysomnography; Risk Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Aged,,"Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Center for Digital Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Center for Digital Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Center for Digital Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Division of Genetic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Google, Mountain View, CA, USA.; Google, Mountain View, CA, USA.; Nelson Connects, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Center for Digital Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Center for Digital Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Division of Genetic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Google, Mountain View, CA, USA.; Google, Mountain View, CA, USA.; Sleep Medicine Center, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Redwood City, CA, USA.; Center for Digital Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. evan.brittain@vumc.org.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. evan.brittain@vumc.org.",10.1038/s41591-024-03155-8
All of Us,40130972,"Associations between Class I, II, or III Obesity and Health Outcomes.","The burden of obesity-related health conditions remains incompletely explored. Previous studies have been underpowered to study severe obesity, focused on a limited set of health outcomes, and lacked diversity in study populations. We studied 270,657 participants from the All of Us research program with linked electronic health records and body mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) greater than or equal to 18.5. We investigated the prevalence and incidence of 16 a priori-identified outcomes covering cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome and others: hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia/dyslipidemia, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, gout, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, biliary calculus, obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and osteoarthritis. Adjusted hazard ratios were calculated for each BMI category and compared with normal weight. The population-attributable fraction was calculated for different obesity classifications. The included population was 62.0% women and 22.0% Black. Class I, II, and III obesity was observed in 21.2%, 11.3%, and 9.8% of participants, respectively. Obesity was strongly associated with all incident outcomes, with graded associations across higher classes of obesity. Class III obesity was most strongly associated with obstructive sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval {CI}], 10.94 [9.97 to 12.00], 7.74 [7.03 to 8.53], and 6.72 [6.01 to 7.50], respectively), with weaker associations for asthma, osteoarthritis, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio [95% CI], 2.14 [1.95 to 2.35], 2.06 [1.94 to 2.19], and 1.96 [1.70 to 2.25], respectively). Associations were consistent across sex and race. The obesity-related population-attributed fraction ranged from 14.0% (osteoarthritis) to 51.5% (obstructive sleep apnea) in this population.

All of Us,39549270,Evaluating Performance and Agreement of Coronary Heart Disease Polygenic Risk Scores.,"Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for coronary heart disease (CHD) are a growing clinical and commercial reality. Whether existing scores provide similar individual-level assessments of disease susceptibility remains incompletely characterized. To characterize the individual-level agreement of CHD PRSs that perform similarly at the population level. Cross-sectional study of participants from diverse backgrounds enrolled in the All of Us Research Program (AOU), Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB), and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) ATLAS Precision Health Biobank with electronic health record and genotyping data. Polygenic risk for CHD from published PRSs and new PRSs developed separately from testing samples. PRSs that performed population-level prediction similarly were identified by comparing calibration and discrimination of models of prevalent CHD. Individual-level agreement was tested with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Light κ. A total of 48 PRSs were calculated for 171 095 AOU participants. The mean (SD) age was 56.4 (16.8) years. A total of 104 947 participants (61.3%) were female. A total of 35 590 participants (20.8%) were most genetically similar to an African reference population, 29 801 (17.4%) to an admixed American reference population, 100 493 (58.7%) to a European reference population, and the remaining to Central/South Asian, East Asian, and Middle Eastern reference populations. There were 17 589 participants (10.3%) with and 153 506 participants without (89.7%) CHD. When included in a model of prevalent CHD, 46 scores had practically equivalent Brier scores and area under the receiver operator curves (region of practical equivalence ±0.02). Twenty percent of participants had at least 1 score in both the top and bottom 5% of risk. Continuous agreement of individual predictions was poor (ICC, 0.373 [95% CI, 0.372-0.375]). Light κ, used to evaluate consistency of risk assignment, did not exceed 0.56. Analysis among 41 193 PMBB and 53 092 ATLAS participants yielded different sets of equivalent scores, which also lacked individual-level agreement. CHD PRSs that performed similarly at the population level demonstrated highly variable individual-level estimates of risk. Recognizing that CHD PRSs may generate incongruent individual-level risk estimates, effective clinical implementation will require refined statistical methods to quantify uncertainty and new strategies to communicate this uncertainty to patients and clinicians.","Abramowitz, Sarah A; Boulier, Kristin; Keat, Karl; Cardone, Katie M; Shivakumar, Manu; DePaolo, John; Judy, Renae; Bermudez, Francisca; Mimouni, Nour; Neylan, Christopher; Kim, Dokyoon; Rader, Daniel J; Ritchie, Marylyn D; Voight, Benjamin F; Pasaniuc, Bogdan; Levin, Michael G; Damrauer, Scott M",JAMA,2025,Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Coronary Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Risk Score; Genotype; Multifactorial Inheritance; Risk Assessment; Area Under Curve; ROC Curve,,"Department of Surgery, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, New York.; Department of Computational Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles.; Genomics and Computational Biology Graduate Program, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Genomics and Computational Biology Graduate Program, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Department of Surgery, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Department of Surgery, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Department of Surgery, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Department of Surgery, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Department of Surgery, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Institute of Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Institute of Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Department of Computational Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles.; Institute of Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Cardiovascular Institute, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Corporal Michael J.

All of Us,38374346,"Selection, optimization and validation of ten chronic disease polygenic risk scores for clinical implementation in diverse US populations.","Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have improved in predictive performance, but several challenges remain to be addressed before PRSs can be implemented in the clinic, including reduced predictive performance of PRSs in diverse populations, and the interpretation and communication of genetic results to both providers and patients. To address these challenges, the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network has developed a framework and pipeline for return of a PRS-based genome-informed risk assessment to 25,000 diverse adults and children as part of a clinical study. From an initial list of 23 conditions, ten were selected for implementation based on PRS performance, medical actionability and potential clinical utility, including cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. Standardized metrics were considered in the selection process, with additional consideration given to strength of evidence in African and Hispanic populations. We then developed a pipeline for clinical PRS implementation (score transfer to a clinical laboratory, validation and verification of score performance), and used genetic ancestry to calibrate PRS mean and variance, utilizing genetically diverse data from 13,475 participants of the All of Us Research Program cohort to train and test model parameters. Finally, we created a framework for regulatory compliance and developed a PRS clinical report for return to providers and for inclusion in an additional genome-informed risk assessment. The initial experience from eMERGE can inform the approach needed to implement PRS-based testing in diverse clinical settings.","Lennon, Niall J; Kottyan, Leah C; Kachulis, Christopher; Abul-Husn, Noura S;

An in silico score for CAD built using machine learning and clinical data in electronic health records captures disease progression, severity and underdiagnosis on this spectrum and could enhance genetic discovery efforts for CAD. Here we tested associations of rare and ultrarare coding variants with the in silico score for CAD in the UK Biobank, All of Us Research Program and BioMe Biobank. We identified associations in 17 genes; of these, 14 show at least moderate levels of prior genetic, biological and/or clinical support for CAD. We also observed an excess of ultrarare coding variants in 321 aggregated CAD genes, suggesting more ultrarare variant associations await discovery. These results expand our understanding of the genetic etiology of CAD and illustrate how digital markers can enhance genetic association investigations for complex diseases.","Petrazzini, Ben Omega; Forrest, Iain S; Rocheleau, Ghislain; Vy, Ha My T; Márquez-Luna, Carla; Duffy, Áine; Chen, Robert; Park, Joshua K; Gibson, Kyle; Goonewardena, Sascha N; Malick, Waqas A; Rosenson, Robert S; Jordan, Daniel M; Do, Ron",Nature genetics,2024,"Coronary Artery Disease; Humans; Machine Learning; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Exome; Exome Sequencing; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Female; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,"The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Genomic Data Analytics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Medical Scientist Training Program, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Genomic Data Analytics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Genomic Data Analytics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Medical Scientist Training Program, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Medical Scientist Training Program, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, VA Ann Arbor Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Metabolism and Lipids Program, Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Metabolism and Lipids Program, Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Genomic Data Analytics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. ron.do@mssm.edu.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. ron.do@mssm.edu.; Center for Genomic Data Analytics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. ron.do@mssm.edu.",10.1038/s41588-024-01791-x

They tackle how to document patients' social histories in a way that is useful in real-time clinical practice-and explore the implementation of a new electronic health record (EHR) template specifically built to support their residency practice's commitment to addressing the social dimensions of patients' lives. For all of us convinced that the simultaneous integration of the biological, social, psychological, and existential dimensions of care is key to the practice of primary care, there are many questions to explore in relation to using EHRs. How are we going to do this in an environment that preferentially supports particularized data over an engaged awareness of context? How are we going to convince those with the technological expertise and administrative power that the transmission of information alone is not a substitute for insight, meaning, and relationships (Ventres & Frankel, 2010)? And ultimately, how are we going to make sure the EHR works for us instead of against us? Kotay and her colleagues have not answered all these questions in their study-such a task is beyond the abilities of one person or group of researchers- but along with others they have begun to illuminate a way forward (Cifuentes et al., 2015; Glowa-Kollisch et al., 2014).

All of Us,34305276,Precision medicine: Concept and tools.,"Precision medicine is the new age medicine and refers to tailoring treatments to a subpopulation who have a common susceptibility to a particular disease or similar response to a particular drug. Although the concept existed even during the times of Sir William Osler, it was given a shot in the arm with the Precision Medicine Initiative launched by Barack Obama in 2015. The main tools of precision medicine are Big data, artificial intelligence, the various omics, pharmaco-omics, environmental and social factors and the integration of these with preventive and population medicine. Big data can be acquired from electronic health records of patients and includes various biomarkers (clinical and omics based), laboratory and radiological investigations and these can be analysed through machine learning by various complex flowcharts setting up an algorithm for the management of specific subpopulations. So, there is a move away from the traditional ""one size fits all"" treatment to precision-based medicine. Research in ""omics"" has increased in leaps and bounds and advancements have included the fields of genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and microbiomics. Pharmaco-omics has also come to the forefront with development of new drugs and suiting a particular drug to a particular subpopulation, thus avoiding their prescription to non-responders, preventing unwanted adverse effects and proving economical in the long run. Environmental, social and behavioural factors are as important or in fact more important than genetic factors in most complex diseases and managing these factors form an important part of precision medicine. Finally integrating precision with preventive and public health makes ""precision medicine"" a complete final product which will change the way medicine will be practised in future.","Naithani, Nardeep; Sinha, Sharmila; Misra, Pratibha; Vasudevan, Biju; Sahu, Rajesh","Medical journal, Armed Forces India",2021,,Big data; Epigenetics; Omics; Precision medicine; Preventive medicine,"Director & Commandant, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, India.; Professor & Head, Department of Pharmacology, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, India.; Professor & Head, Department of Biochemistry, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, India.; Professor & Head, Department of Dermatology, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, India.; Associate Professor, Department of Community Medicine, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, India.",10.1016/j.mjafi.2021.06.021
All of Us,38097619,Polygenic risk alters the penetrance of monogenic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined by an interplay of monogenic, polygenic, and environmental risks. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and COL4A-associated nephropathy (COL4A-AN) represent the most common forms of monogenic kidney diseases. These disorders have incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, and we hypothesize that polygenic factors explain some of this variability. By combining SNP array, exome/genome sequence, and electronic health record data from the UK Biobank and All-of-Us cohorts, we demonstrate that the genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) significantly predicts CKD among ADPKD monogenic variant carriers. Compared to the middle tertile of the GPS for noncarriers, ADPKD variant carriers in the top tertile have a 54-fold increased risk of CKD, while ADPKD variant carriers in the bottom tertile have only a 3-fold increased risk of CKD. Similarly, the GPS significantly predicts CKD in COL4A-AN carriers. The carriers in the top tertile of the GPS have a 2.5-fold higher risk of CKD, while the risk for carriers in the bottom tertile is not different from the average population risk. These results suggest that accounting for polygenic risk improves risk stratification in monogenic kidney disease.","Khan, Atlas; Shang, Ning; Nestor, Jordan G; Weng, Chunhua; Hripcsak, George; Harris, Peter C; Gharavi, Ali G; Kiryluk, Krzysztof",Nature communications,2023,"Humans; Penetrance; Polycystic Kidney, Autosomal Dominant; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Multifactorial Inheritance; Risk Factors",,"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. kk473@columbia.edu.",10.1038/s41467-023-43878-9
All of Us,39316441,Proteogenomic analysis integrated with electronic health records data reveals disease-associated variants in Black Americans.,"BACKGROUNDMost GWAS of plasma proteomics have focused on White individuals of European ancestry, limiting biological insight from other ancestry-enriched protein quantitative loci (pQTL).METHODSWe conducted a discovery GWAS of approximately 3,000 plasma proteins measured by the antibody-based Olink platform in 1,054 Black adults from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) and validated our findings in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). The genetic architecture of identified pQTLs was further explored through fine mapping and admixture association analysis. Finally, using our pQTL findings, we performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) across 2 large multiethnic electronic health record (EHR) systems in All of Us and BioMe.RESULTSWe identified 1,002 pQTLs for 925 protein assays. Fine mapping and admixture analyses suggested allelic heterogeneity of the plasma proteome across diverse populations. We identified associations for variants enriched in African ancestry, many in diseases that lack precise biomarkers, including cis-pQTLs for cathepsin L (CTSL) and Siglec-9, which were linked with sarcoidosis and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively. We found concordant associations across clinical diagnoses and laboratory measurements, elucidating disease pathways, including a cis-pQTL associated with circulating CD58, WBC count, and multiple sclerosis.CONCLUSIONSOur findings emphasize the value of leveraging diverse populations to enhance biological insights from proteomics GWAS, and we have made this resource readily available as an interactive web portal.FUNDINGNIH K08 HL161445-01A1;

We report 100% of participants carried at least one pharmacogenomics variant and nearly all (99.13%) had a predicted phenotype with prescribing recommendations. Clinical impact was high with over 20% having both an actionable phenotype and a prior exposure to an impacted medication with pharmacogenomic prescribing guidance.

All of Us,39366729,Forecasting the effects of smoking prevalence scenarios on years of life lost and life expectancy from 2022 to 2050: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.,"Smoking is the leading behavioural risk factor for mortality globally, accounting for more than 175 million deaths and nearly 4·30 billion years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2021. The pace of decline in smoking prevalence has slowed in recent years for many countries, and although strategies have recently been proposed to achieve tobacco-free generations, none have been implemented to date. Assessing what could happen if current trends in smoking prevalence persist, and what could happen if additional smoking prevalence reductions occur, is important for communicating the effect of potential smoking policies. In this analysis, we use the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Future Health Scenarios platform to forecast the effects of three smoking prevalence scenarios on all-cause and cause-specific YLLs and life expectancy at birth until 2050. YLLs were computed for each scenario using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 reference life table and forecasts of cause-specific mortality under each scenario. The reference scenario forecasts what could occur if past smoking prevalence and other risk factor trends continue, the Tobacco Smoking Elimination as of 2023 (Elimination-2023) scenario quantifies the maximum potential future health benefits from assuming zero percent smoking prevalence from 2023 onwards, whereas the Tobacco Smoking Elimination by 2050 (Elimination-2050) scenario provides estimates for countries considering policies to steadily reduce smoking prevalence to 5%. Together, these scenarios underscore the magnitude of health benefits that could be reached by 2050 if countries take decisive action to eliminate smoking. The 95% uncertainty interval (UI) of estimates is based on the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile of draws that were carried through the multistage computational framework. Global age-standardised smoking prevalence was estimated to be 28·5% (95% UI 27·9-29·1) among males and 5·96% (5·76-6·21) among females in 2022. In the reference scenario, smoking prevalence declined by 25·9% (25·2-26·6) among males, and 30·0% (26·1-32·1) among females from 2022 to 2050. Under this scenario, we forecast a cumulative 29·3 billion (95% UI 26·8-32·4) overall YLLs among males and 22·2 billion (20·1-24·6) YLLs among females over this period. Life expectancy at birth under this scenario would increase from 73·6 years (95% UI 72·8-74·4) in 2022 to 78·3 years (75·9-80·3) in 2050. Under our Elimination-2023 scenario, we forecast 2·04 billion (95% UI 1·90-2·21) fewer cumulative YLLs by 2050 compared with the reference scenario, and life expectancy at birth would increase to 77·6 years (95% UI 75·1-79·6) among males and 81·0 years (78·5-83·1) among females. Under our Elimination-2050 scenario, we forecast 735 million (675-808) and 141 million (131-154) cumulative YLLs would be avoided among males and females, respectively. Life expectancy in 2050 would increase to 77·1 years (95% UI 74·6-79·0) among males and 80·8 years (78·3-82·9) among females. Existing tobacco policies must be maintained if smoking prevalence is to continue to decline as forecast by the reference scenario. In addition, substantial smoking-attributable burden can be avoided by accelerating the pace of smoking elimination. Implementation of new tobacco control policies are crucial in avoiding additional smoking-attributable burden in the coming decades and to ensure that the gains won over the past three decades are not lost.

All of Us,40009714,"Epidemiology, genetics and management of vitiligo in the USA: an All of Us investigation.","Vitiligo is an autoimmune skin depigmentation disorder significantly impacting quality of life. This condition is difficult to treat, with high relapse rates. Additionally, vitiligo associates with other autoimmune conditions, complicating patient management. Improving patient outcomes relies on understanding vitiligo's clinical landscape and genetic risk factors. We aimed to understand vitiligo's patient distribution, current management practices, how comorbid autoimmune conditions influence treatment and how genetic risk factors vary in diverse populations. We conducted a cross-sectional study of the All of Us research program, consisting of surveys, electronic health records and genomic data from 206,173 participants in the USA recruited between the summer of 2017 and 1 July 2022. We determined diagnostic and prescribing rates and elucidated differences in genetic risk within different populations. Oral corticosteroids are most frequently prescribed, followed by other immunosuppressive drugs and topical medications. Comorbid systemic lupus erythematosus impacted treatment choices. Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with increased risk in patients of European decent were not always associated with increase risk in patients of other ancestry. This work highlights the current treatment landscape for vitiligo in the USA. We demonstrated that comorbid conditions impact treatment choices and genetic risk factors vary between ethnic groups. This study highlights differences in vitiligo management where comorbid conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, may influence treatment decisions. We also demonstrate the diversity in genetic risk factors, where some single nucleotide polymorphisms that are a risk in one ethnic group are not a risk in another.","Gupta, Aditya K; Economopoulos, Vasiliki",The Journal of dermatological treatment,2025,"Humans; Vitiligo; Cross-Sectional Studies; United States; Male; Female; Adult; Middle Aged; Immunosuppressive Agents; Risk Factors; Young Adult; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Comorbidity; Adolescent; Autoimmune Diseases; Aged; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Child; Administration, Oral",Vitiligo; disease management; epidemiology; genetics of vitiligo,"Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto School of Medicine, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Mediprobe Research Inc., London, Ontario, Canada.; Mediprobe Research Inc., London, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medical Biophysics, Schulich Scholl of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.",10.1080/09546634.2025.2471451

Here we introduce an age-dependent topic modeling (ATM) method that provides a low-rank representation of longitudinal records of hundreds of distinct diseases in large EHR datasets. We applied ATM to 282,957 UK Biobank samples, identifying 52 diseases with heterogeneous comorbidity profiles; analyses of 211,908 All of Us samples produced concordant results. We defined subtypes of the 52 heterogeneous diseases based on their comorbidity profiles and compared genetic risk across disease subtypes using polygenic risk scores (PRSs), identifying 18 disease subtypes whose PRS differed significantly from other subtypes of the same disease. We further identified specific genetic variants with subtype-dependent effects on disease risk. In conclusion, ATM identifies disease subtypes with differential genome-wide and locus-specific genetic risk profiles.","Jiang, Xilin; Zhang, Martin Jinye; Zhang, Yidong; Durvasula, Arun; Inouye, Michael; Holmes, Chris; Price, Alkes L; McVean, Gil",Nature genetics,2023,Humans; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Biological Specimen Banks; Genome-Wide Association Study; Population Health; Risk Factors; Comorbidity; Multifactorial Inheritance; United Kingdom,,"Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. xilinjiang@hsph.harvard.edu.; Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. xilinjiang@hsph.harvard.edu.; Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. xilinjiang@hsph.harvard.edu.; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

Descriptive secondary analysis feasibility study using data from the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program. United States. Women (N = 89) who had a birth or length of gestation code in the EHR and at least 60 days of Fitbit heart rate data during pregnancy. We estimated pregnancy-related episodes using EHR codes. Time consisted of five 3-month periods: before pregnancy, first trimester, second trimester, third trimester, and after birth. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. An average of 330 days (SD = 112) of Fitbit heart rate data (29,392 days) were available from participants. During pregnancy, distinct peaks in heart rate occurred during the first trimester (6% increase) and third trimester (15% increase). Future researchers can examine whether longitudinal timing and patterns of heart rate from wearable devices could be leveraged to detect health problems early in pregnancy.","Modde Epstein, Crystal; McCoy, Thomas P","Journal of obstetric, gynecologic, and neonatal nursing : JOGNN",2023,"Pregnancy; Humans; Female; United States; Electronic Health Records; Population Health; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Wearable Electronic Devices",cardiovascular system; hemodynamic; maternal; physiology; postpartum; wearable electronic devices,,10.1016/j.jogn.2022.12.003
All of Us,35803232,Digital health-enabled genomics: Opportunities and challenges.,"Digital health solutions, with apps, virtual care, and electronic medical records, are gaining momentum across all medical disciplines, and their adoption has been accelerated, in part, by the COVID-19 pandemic. Personal wearables, sensors, and mobile technologies are increasingly being used to identify health risks and assist in diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of health and disease. Genomics is a vanguard of digital healthcare as we witness a convergence of the fields of genomic and digital medicine. Spurred by the acute need to increase health literacy, empower patients' preference-sensitive decisions, or integrate vast amounts of complex genomic data into the clinical workflow, there has been an emergence of digital support tools in genomics-enabled care. We present three use cases that demonstrate the application of these converging technologies: digital genomics decision support tools, conversational chatbots to scale the genetic counseling process, and the digital delivery of comprehensive genetic services. These digital solutions are important to facilitate patient-centered care delivery, improve patient outcomes, and increase healthcare efficiencies in genomic medicine. Yet the development of these innovative digital genomic technologies also reveals strategic challenges that need to be addressed before genomic digital health can be broadly adopted. Alongside key evidentiary gaps in clinical and cost-effectiveness, there is a paucity of clinical guidelines, policy, and regulatory frameworks that incorporate digital health. We propose a research agenda, guided by learning healthcare systems, to realize the vision of digital health-enabled genomics to ensure its sustainable and equitable deployment in clinical care.","Bombard, Yvonne; Ginsburg, Geoffrey S; Sturm, Amy C; Zhou, Alicia Y; Lemke, Amy A",American journal of human genetics,2022,COVID-19; Delivery of Health Care; Electronic Health Records; Genomics; Humans; Pandemics,,"University of Toronto, Genomics Health Services Research Program, St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, 30 Bond Street, Toronto, ON, M5B 1W8, Canada.

All of Us,36474423,Characterizing variability of electronic health record-driven phenotype definitions.,"The aim of this study was to analyze a publicly available sample of rule-based phenotype definitions to characterize and evaluate the variability of logical constructs used. A sample of 33 preexisting phenotype definitions used in research that are represented using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) was analyzed using automated analysis of the computable representation of the CQL libraries. Most of the phenotype definitions include narrative descriptions and flowcharts, while few provide pseudocode or executable artifacts. Most use 4 or fewer medical terminologies. The number of codes used ranges from 5 to 6865, and value sets from 1 to 19. We found that the most common expressions used were literal, data, and logical expressions. Aggregate and arithmetic expressions are the least common. Expression depth ranges from 4 to 27. Despite the range of conditions, we found that all of the phenotype definitions consisted of logical criteria, representing both clinical and operational logic, and tabular data, consisting of codes from standard terminologies and keywords for natural language processing. The total number and variety of expressions are low, which may be to simplify implementation, or authors may limit complexity due to data availability constraints. The phenotype definitions analyzed show significant variation in specific logical, arithmetic, and other operators but are all composed of the same high-level components, namely tabular data and logical expressions. A standard representation for phenotype definitions should support these formats and be modular to support localization and shared logic.","Brandt, Pascal S; Kho, Abel; Luo, Yuan; Pacheco, Jennifer A; Walunas, Theresa L; Hakonarson, Hakon; Hripcsak, George; Liu, Cong; Shang, Ning; Weng, Chunhua; Walton, Nephi; Carrell, David S; Crane, Paul K; Larson, Eric B; Chute, Christopher G; Kullo, Iftikhar J; Carroll, Robert; Denny, Josh; Ramirez, Andrea; Wei, Wei-Qi; Pathak, Jyoti; Wiley, Laura K; Richesson, Rachel; Starren, Justin B; Rasmussen, Luke V",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2023,Electronic Health Records; Language; Phenotype; Narration,CQL; EHR-driven phenotyping; FHIR; cohort identification,"Department of Biomedical and Medical Education, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Center for Applied Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.; Intermountain Precision Genomics, Intermountain Healthcare, St George, Utah, USA.; Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Department of Health Services, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.; Schools of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; All of Us Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, USA.; Department of Learning Health Sciences, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.; Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.",10.1093/jamia/ocac235

However, developing personalized therapies requires analyses with substantial statistical power to map genetic and epidemiologic associations that ultimately create models informing clinical decisions. As one solution, biobanks have emerged as large-scale, longitudinal cohort studies with long-term storage of biological specimens and health information, including electronic health records and participant survey responses. By providing access to individual-level data for genotype-phenotype mapping efforts, pharmacogenomic studies, polygenic risk score assessments and rare variant analyses, biobanks support ongoing and future precision medicine research. Notably, due in part to the geographical enrichment of biobanks in Western Europe and North America, European ancestries have become disproportionately over-represented in precision medicine research. Herein, we provide a genetics-focused review of biobanks from around the world that are in pursuit of supporting precision medicine.

All of Us,39094953,Associations between Statin Use and Glaucoma in the All of Us Research Program.,"To investigate associations between statin use and glaucoma in the 2017 to 2022 All of Us (AoU) Research Program. Cross-sectional, population-based. 79 742 adult participants aged ≥40 years with hyperlipidemia and with electronic health record (EHR) data in the AoU database. Hyperlipidemia, glaucoma status, and statin use were defined by diagnoses and medication information in EHR data collected by AoU. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between statin use and glaucoma likelihood. Logistic regression modeling was used to examine associations between glaucoma and all covariates included in adjusted analysis. Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was used to assess hyperlipidemia severity. Analyses stratified by LDL-C level and age were performed. Any glaucoma as defined by International Classification of Diseases codes found in EHR data. Of 79 742 individuals with hyperlipidemia in AoU, there were 6365 (8.0%) statin users. Statin use was associated with increased glaucoma prevalence when compared with statin nonuse (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.26). Higher serum levels of LDL-C were associated with increased odds of glaucoma (aOR: 1.003, 95% CI: 1.003, 1.004). Statin users had significantly higher LDL-C levels compared to nonusers (144.9 mg/dL versus 136.3 mg/dL, P value < 0.001). Analysis stratified by LDL-C identified positive associations between statin use and prevalence of glaucoma among those with optimal (aOR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.05-1.82) and high (aOR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.09-1.70) LDL-C levels. Age-stratified analysis showed a positive association between statin use and prevalence of glaucoma in individuals aged 60 to 69 years (aOR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.05-1.56). Statin use was associated with increased glaucoma likelihood in the overall adult AoU population with hyperlipidemia, in individuals with optimal or high LDL-C levels, and in individuals 60 to 69 years old. Findings suggest that statin use may be an independent risk factor for glaucoma, which may furthermore be affected by one's lipid profile and age.

This study measured the association between daily preoperative step counts and postoperative complications. Data were obtained using the All of Us (AOU) Research program, a nationwide initiative to collect EHR and health-related data from the population. Patients who underwent a surgical procedure included in the NSQIP-targeted procedures dataset were included. Patients who did not have available physical activity FitBit data were excluded. Primary outcome was the development of a postoperative complication. All analyses were performed in the AOU researcher workbench. Of 27,150 patients who underwent a surgical procedure, 475 participants with preoperative wearable data were included: 74.7% were female and 85.2% were White. The average age was 57.2 years. The overall rate of postoperative complications was 12.6%. Patients averaging less than 7,500 daily steps were at increased odds for developing a postoperative complication (odds ratio 1.83, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.31). After adjustment for age, sex, race, comorbid disease, BMI, and relative procedure risk, patients with a baseline average steps per day less than 7,500 were at increased odds for postoperative complication (adjusted odds ratio 2.06, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.06). This study found an increase in overall postoperative complication rate in patients recording lower average preoperative step counts. Patients with a baseline of less than 7,500 steps per day had increased odds of postoperative complications in this cohort. These data support the use of wearable devices for surgical risk stratification and suggest step count may measure preoperative fitness.","Gehl, Carson J; Verhagen, Nathaniel B; Shaik, Tahseen J; Nimmer, Kaitlyn; Yang, Xin; Xing, Yun; Taylor, Bradley W; Nataliansyah, Mochamad M; Kerns, Sarah L; Kothari, Anai N",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,2024,Humans; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; United States; Aged; Adult; Walking; Risk Factors; Wearable Electronic Devices,,"From the Division of Surgical Oncology, Departments of Surgery (Gehl, Verhagen, Shaik, Nimmer, Nataliansyah, Kothari), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.; From the Division of Surgical Oncology, Departments of Surgery (Gehl, Verhagen, Shaik, Nimmer, Nataliansyah, Kothari), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.; From the Division of Surgical Oncology, Departments of Surgery (Gehl, Verhagen, Shaik, Nimmer, Nataliansyah, Kothari), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.; From the Division of Surgical Oncology, Departments of Surgery (Gehl, Verhagen, Shaik, Nimmer, Nataliansyah, Kothari), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.; Biostatistics (Yang, Xing), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.; Biostatistics (Yang, Xing), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.; Clinical and Translational Science Institute of Southeastern Wisconsin (Taylor, Kothari), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.; From the Division of Surgical Oncology, Departments of Surgery (Gehl, Verhagen, Shaik, Nimmer, Nataliansyah, Kothari), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.; Radiation Oncology (Kerns), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.; From the Division of Surgical Oncology, Departments of Surgery (Gehl, Verhagen, Shaik, Nimmer, Nataliansyah, Kothari), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.; Clinical and Translational Science Institute of Southeastern Wisconsin (Taylor, Kothari), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.; Data Science Institute (Kothari), Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.",10.1097/XCS.0000000000001136

This study assesses the differential risks of hyponatremia associated with commonly prescribed SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram), SNRIs (duloxetine, venlafaxine) and NRI (bupropion), as well as omeprazole as a reference, with a retrospective observational cohort study in the All of Us Research Program, a national multicenter research cohort containing de-identified electronic health records (EHR). Participants who had been prescribed monotherapy with any of eight common antidepressants were included, with each drug considered as a separate arm indexed with a start date. Events were defined as the first occurrence of a low plasma sodium measurement or a clinical diagnosis recorded for either hyponatremia or SIADH. Those who did not have events were censored at their last plasma sodium measurement. A total of 17,439 individuals were exposed to one of the eight antidepressants as monotherapy. The overall incidences for hyponatremia were 0.87% in the first 30 days and 10.5% in the first 3 years in the antidepressant arms. Compared to sertraline, duloxetine (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37 [1.19-1.58]) and escitalopram (HR = 1.16 [1.01-1.33]) were associated with the highest overall risk of hyponatremia, and bupropion (HR = 0.83 [0.73-0.94]) and paroxetine (HR = 0.78 [0.65-0.93]) were associated with the lowest risk. The risks were unchanged after adjusting for comorbidity and polypharmacy. Such information could help guide providers in managing patients and their risks of hyponatremia when on common antidepressants.","Mo, Huan; Channa, Yamna; Ferrara, Tracey M; Waxse, Bennett J; Schlueter, David J; Tran, Tam C; Awan, Anas H; Goleva, Slavina B; Williams, Ariel; Babbar, Anav; Stubblefield, Onajia; Keaton, Jacob M; Larson, Eric A; Wilke, Russell A; Denny, Joshua C",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2025,Humans; Hyponatremia; Female; Male; Retrospective Studies; Middle Aged; Antidepressive Agents; United States; Aged; Inappropriate ADH Syndrome; Adult; Sodium; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; Incidence; Risk Factors,,"Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; The Cohort Analytics Core (CAC), Center for Precision Health Research, NHGRI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; The Cohort Analytics Core (CAC), Center for Precision Health Research, NHGRI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Department of Health and Society, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; The Cohort Analytics Core (CAC), Center for Precision Health Research, NHGRI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Dakota, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Dakota, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland, USA.",10.1002/cpt.3484

Current treatments for patients ease discomfort and help decrease disease progression; however, none improve lung function or change mortality. COPD is heterogeneous in its molecular and clinical presentation, making it difficult to understand disease aetiology and define robust therapeutic strategies. Given the complexity of the disease we propose a precision medicine approach to understanding and better treating COPD. It is possible that multiOMICs can be used as a tool to integrate data from multiple fields.

This novel method detects potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) by leveraging data from the electronic health record (EHR) allergy list. To identify potential DDIs, DDIWAS scans for drug pairs that are frequently documented together on the allergy list. Using deidentified medical records, we tested 616 drugs for potential DDIs with simvastatin (a common lipid-lowering drug) and amlodipine (a common blood-pressure lowering drug). We evaluated the performance to rediscover known DDIs using existing knowledge bases and domain expert review. To validate potential novel DDIs, we manually reviewed patient charts and searched the literature. DDIWAS replicated 34 known DDIs. The positive predictive value to detect known DDIs was 0.85 and 0.86 for simvastatin and amlodipine, respectively. DDIWAS also discovered potential novel interactions between simvastatin-hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine-omeprazole, and amlodipine-valacyclovir. A software package to conduct DDIWAS is publicly available. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate the value of incorporating information mined from existing allergy lists to detect DDIs in a real-world clinical setting.

All of Us (AoU) is an ongoing precision medicine-based research initiative by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that facilitates research in populations traditionally underrepresented in biomedical research by prioritizing them for data collection. Our objective was to evaluate the burden of onychomycosis in underrepresented groups defined by the framework provided by AoU. The AoU Registered Tier dataset version 5 was used which includes data collected between May 30, 2017 and April 1, 2021. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis linking survey and electronic health record (EHR) data to estimate the prevalence of onychomycosis in underrepresented groups defined by race, ethnicity, age (≥ 75 years), disability, sexual orientation/gender identity (LGBTQIA +), income (annual household income ≤ $35 000) and education (less than a high school degree). The latest All of Us data release includes 329,038 participants. Of these, 251,597 (76%) had EHR data and 13,874 had onychomycosis (overall prevalence, 5.5%; 95% CI, 5.4-5.6). Multivariate analyses adjusted by tinea pedis, diabetes mellitus, immune compromise, nail psoriasis, and insurance status, in addition to the aforementioned variables, revealed that, compared with White participants, Black and Hispanic participants had a higher adjusted odds of onychomycosis (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.23-1.36 and OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17-1.31, respectively).

All of Us,39158908,"Contextual Deprivation, Race and Ethnicity, and Income in Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease.","Socioeconomically disadvantaged subpopulations are more vulnerable to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure. However, as prior studies focused on individual-level socioeconomic characteristics, how contextual deprivation modifies the association of PM2.5 exposure with cardiovascular health remains unclear. To assess disparities in PM2.5 exposure association with cardiovascular disease among subpopulations defined by different socioeconomic characteristics. This cohort study used longitudinal data on participants with electronic health records (EHRs) from the All of Us Research Program between calendar years 2016 and 2022. Statistical analysis was performed from September 25, 2023, through February 23, 2024. Satellite-derived 5-year mean PM2.5 exposure at the 3-digit zip code level according to participants' residential address. Incident myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke were obtained from the EHRs. Stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) between PM2.5 exposure and incident MI or stroke. We evaluated subpopulations defined by 3 socioeconomic characteristics: contextual deprivation (less deprived, more deprived), annual household income (≥$50 000, <$50 000), and race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White). We calculated the ratio of HRs (RHR) to quantify disparities between these subpopulations. A total of 210 554 participants were analyzed (40% age >60 years; 59.4% female; 16.7% Hispanic, 19.4% Non-Hispanic Black, 56.1% Non-Hispanic White, 7.9% other [American Indian, Asian, more than 1 race and ethnicity]), among whom 954 MI and 1407 stroke cases were identified. Higher PM2.5 levels were associated with higher MI and stroke risks. However, disadvantaged groups (more deprived, income <$50 000 per year, Black race) were more vulnerable to high PM2.5 levels. The disparities were most pronounced between groups defined by contextual deprivation. For instance, increasing PM2.5 from 6 to 10 μg/m3, the HR for stroke was 1.13 (95% CI, 0.85-1.51) in the less-deprived vs 2.57 (95% CI, 2.06-3.21) in the more-deprived cohort; 1.46 (95% CI, 1.07-2.01) in the $50 000 or more per year vs 2.27 (95% CI, 1.73-2.97) in the under $50 000 per year cohort; and 1.70 (95% CI, 1.35-2.16) in White individuals vs 2.76 (95% CI, 1.89-4.02) in Black individuals. The RHR was highest for contextual deprivation (2.27; 95% CI, 1.59-3.24), compared with income (1.55; 95% CI, 1.05-2.29) and race and ethnicity (1.62; 95% CI, 1.02-2.58). In this cohort study, while individual race and ethnicity and income remained crucial in the adverse association of PM2.5 with cardiovascular risks, contextual deprivation was a more robust socioeconomic characteristic modifying the association of PM2.5 exposure.","Luo, Jiajun; Craver, Andrew; Jin, Zhihao; Zheng, Liang; Kim, Karen; Polonsky, Tamar; Olopade, Christopher O; Pinto, Jayant M; Ahsan, Habibul; Aschebrook-Kilfoy, Briseis",JAMA network open,2024,Humans; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Air Pollution; Particulate Matter; Income; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; United States; Adult; Ethnicity; Myocardial Infarction; Environmental Exposure; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Cohort Studies; Racial Groups; Stroke; Health Status Disparities,,"Department of Public Health Sciences, Biological Science Division, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.; Institute for Population and Precision Health, Biological Science Division, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.; Institute for Population and Precision Health, Biological Science Division, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.; Gangarosa Department of Environmental Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.; Department of Thyroid Surgery, the First Hospital Affiliated with Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.; Department of Medicine, Pennsylvania State College of Medicine, Hershey.; Department of Medicine, Biological Science Division, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.; Department of Medicine, Biological Science Division, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.; Department of Family Medicine, Biological Science Division, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.; Department of Surgery, Biological Science Division, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.; Department of Public Health Sciences, Biological Science Division, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.; Institute for Population and Precision Health, Biological Science Division, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.; Department of Family Medicine, Biological Science Division, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.; Department of Public Health Sciences, Biological Science Division, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.; Institute for Population and Precision Health, Biological Science Division, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.29137

The program's focus on diversity and inclusion promises a better understanding of the unequal burden of cancer. Preliminary cancer ascertainment in the All of Us cohort from two data sources (self-reported versus electronic health records (EHR)) is considered. This work was performed on data collected from the All of Us Research Program's 315,297 enrolled participants to date using the Researcher Workbench, where approved researchers can access and analyze All of Us data on cancer and other diseases. Cancer case ascertainment was performed using data from EHR and self-reported surveys across key factors. Distribution of cancer types and concordance of data sources by cancer site and demographics is analyzed. Data collected from 315,297 participants resulted in 13,298 cancer cases detected in the survey (in 89,261 participants), 23,520 cancer cases detected in the EHR (in 203,813 participants), and 7,123 cancer cases detected across both sources (in 62,497 participants). Key differences in survey completion by race/ethnicity impacted the makeup of cohorts when compared to cancer in the EHR and national NCI SEER data.

All of Us,39585167,Discovering Severe Adverse Reactions From Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interactions Through Literature Analysis and Electronic Health Record Verification.,"While drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and their pharmacokinetic (PK) mechanisms are well-studied prior to drug approval, severe adverse drug reactions (SADRs) caused by DDIs often remain underrecognized due to limitations in pre-marketing clinical trials. To address this gap, our study utilized a literature database, applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and conducted multi-source electronic health record (EHR) validation to uncover underrecognized DDI-SADR signals that warrant further investigation. PubMed abstracts related to DDIs from January 1962 to December 2023 were retrieved. We utilized PubTator Central for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify drugs and SADRs and employed SciFive for Relation Extraction (RE) to extract DDI-SADR signals. The extracted signals were cross-referenced with the DrugBank database and validated using logistic regression, considering risk factors including patient demographics, drug usage, and comorbidities, based on EHRs from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and the All of Us research program. From 160,321 abstracts, we identified 111 DDI-SADR signals. Seventeen were statistically significant (13 by one EHR and 4 by both EHR databases), with 9 being previously not recorded in the DrugBank. These included methadone-ciprofloxacin-respiratory depression, oxycodone-fluvoxamine-clonus, tramadol-fluconazole-hallucination, simvastatin-fluconazole-rhabdomyolysis, ibrutinib-amiodarone-atrial fibrillation, fentanyl-diltiazem-delirium, clarithromycin-voriconazole-acute kidney injury, colchicine-cyclosporine-rhabdomyolysis, and methadone-voriconazole-arrhythmia (odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.9 to 35.83, with P-values ranging from < 0.001 to 0.017). Utilizing NLP to extract DDI-SADRs from Biomedical Literature and validating these findings through multiple-source EHRs represents a pioneering approach in pharmacovigilance. This method uncovers clinically relevant SADRs resulting from DDIs that were not evident in pre-marketing trials or the existing DDI knowledge base.","Jeong, Eugene; Su, Yu; Li, Lang; Chen, You",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2025,"Humans; Drug Interactions; Electronic Health Records; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Natural Language Processing; Databases, Factual; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Data Mining; Pharmacovigilance; Risk Factors",,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Computer Science, School of Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.",10.1002/cpt.3500
All of Us,28276633,Public health and precision medicine share a goal.,"The advances made in genomics and molecular tools aid public health programs in the investigation of outbreaks and control of diseases by taking advantage of the precision medicine. Precision medicine means ""segregating the individuals into subpopulations who vary in their disease susceptibility and response to a precise treatment"" and not merely designing of drugs or creation of medical devices. By 2017, the United Kingdom 100,000 Genomes Project is expected to sequence 100,000 genomes from 70,000 patients. Similarly, the Precision Medicine Initiative of the United States plans to increase population-based genome sequencing and link it with clinical data. A national cohort of around 1 million people is to be established in the long term, to investigate the genetic and environmental determinants of health and disease, and further integrated to their electronic health records that are optional. Precision public health can be seen as administering the right intervention to the needy population at an appropriate time. Precision medicine originates from a wet-lab while evidence-based medicine is nurtured in a clinic. Linking the quintessential basic science research and clinical practice is necessary. In addition, new technologies to employ and analyze data in an integrated and dynamic way are essential for public health and precision medicine. The transition from evidence-based approach in public health to genomic approach to individuals with a paradigm shift of a ""reactive"" medicine to a more ""proactive"" and personalized health care may sound exceptional. However, a population perspective is needed for the precision medicine to succeed.","Vaithinathan, Asokan G; Asokan, Vanitha",Journal of evidence-based medicine,2017,"Disease Susceptibility; Evidence-Based Medicine; Genome, Human; Genomics; Goals; Humans; Precision Medicine; Public Health; United Kingdom; United States",data science; evidence-based public health; precision medicine; precision public health; public health,"Public Health Program, Allied Health Division, College of Health Sciences, University of Bahrain, Kingdom of Bahrain.; Pediatrics Department, American Mission Hospital, Manama, Kingdom of Bahrain.",10.1111/jebm.12239

All of Us (AoU) is a National Institute of Health initiative with an emphasis on patient populations traditionally underrepresented in biomedical research. Our objective was to evaluate the burden of tinea pedis in underrepresented groups in the United States, utilising the novel AoU research program. We analysed AoU Registered Tier dataset version 5, which includes data collected between 30 May, 2017, and 1 April, 2021. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis linking survey and electronic health record (EHR) data to estimate the prevalence of tinea pedis in underrepresented groups. All of Us data release includes 329,038 participants. Of these, 251,597 (76.5%) had electronic health record data and 6932 had tinea pedis (overall prevalence, 2.76%; 95% CI, 2.69-2.82). Multivariate analyses revealed that compared with White participants, Black and Hispanic participants had a higher adjusted odds of tinea pedis (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.20-1.38 and OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.28-1.48, respectively).

We describe the demographic characteristics of participants who decline access to their EHR data. We included participants enrolling in AoURP between June 6, 2017 and December 31, 2019 through the Trans-American Consortium for the Health Care Systems Research Network (TACH). TACH is a consortium of health care systems spanning 6 states, and an AoURP research partner. We analyzed data for 25 852 participants (89.3% of those enrolled). Mean age = 52.0 years (SD 16.8), with 66.5% White, 18.7% Black/African American, 7.7% Hispanic, 32.5% female, and 76% with >a high school diploma. Overall, 2.3% of participants declined to share access to their EHR data (range across TACH sites = 1.3% to 3.5%). Younger age, female sex, and education >high school were significantly associated with decline to share EHR data, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 1.26 (1.19-1.33), 1.74 (1.42-2.14), and 2.44 (1.86-3.21), respectively. Results were similar when several sensitivity analyses were performed. AoURP seeks a dataset reflecting our nation's diversity in all aspects of participation. Those under-represented in biomedical research may be reluctant to share access to their EHR data. In our data, race and ethnicity were not independently related to participant decision to decline access to their EHR information.

All of Us,40009368,Genetic Correlates of Treatment-Resistant Depression.,"Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a major challenge in mental health, affecting a significant number of patients and leading to considerable burdens. The etiological factors contributing to TRD are complex and not fully understood. To investigate the genetic factors associated with TRD using polygenic scores (PGS) across various traits and explore their potential role in the etiology of TRD using large-scale genomic data from the All of Us (AoU) Research Program. This study was a cohort design with observational data from participants in the AoU Research Program who have both electronic health records and genomic data. Data analysis was performed from March 27 to October 24, 2024. PGS for 61 unique traits from 7 domains. Logistic regressions to test if PGS was associated with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) compared with treatment-responsive major depressive disorder (trMDD). Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine if the progressions from MDD to TRD were associated with PGS. A total of 292 663 participants (median [IQR] age, 57 (41-69) years; 175 981 female [60.1%]) from the AoU Research Program were included in this analysis. In the discovery set (124 945 participants), 11 of the selected PGS were found to have stronger associations with TRD than with trMDD, encompassing PGS from domains in education, cognition, personality, sleep, and temperament. Genetic predisposition for insomnia (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.15) and specific neuroticism (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.16) traits were associated with increased TRD risk, whereas higher education (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.85-0.91) and intelligence (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.94) scores were protective. The associations held across different TRD definitions (meta-analytic R2 >83%) and were consistent across 2 other independent sets within AoU (the whole-genome sequencing Diversity dataset, 104 388, and Microarray dataset, 63 330). Among 28 964 individuals followed up over time, 3854 developed TRD within a mean of 944 days (95% CI, 883-992 days). All 11 previously identified and replicated PGS were found to be modulating the conversion rate from MDD to TRD. Results of this cohort study suggest that genetic predisposition related to neuroticism, cognitive function, and sleep patterns had a significant association with the development of TRD. These findings underscore the importance of considering psychosocial factors in managing and treating TRD. Future research should focus on integrating genetic data with clinical outcomes to enhance understanding of pathways leading to treatment resistance.","Xu, Bohan; Forthman, Katherine L; Kuplicki, Rayus; Ahern, Jonathan; Loughnan, Robert; Naber, Firas; Thompson, Wesley K; Nemeroff, Charles B; Paulus, Martin P; Fan, Chun Chieh",JAMA psychiatry,2025,,,"Population Neuroscience and Genetics Center, Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma.; Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma.; Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma.; Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma.; Population Neuroscience and Genetics Center, Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma.; Center for Human Development, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.; Population Neuroscience and Genetics Center, Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma.; Center for Human Development, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.; Population Neuroscience and Genetics Center, Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma.; Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma.; Population Neuroscience and Genetics Center, Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma.; Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma.; Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, the Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin.; Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma.; Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.; Population Neuroscience and Genetics Center, Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma.; Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma.; Department of Radiology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.",10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2024.4825
All of Us,37343562,Studying the impact of translational genomic research: Lessons from eMERGE.,"Two major goals of the Electronic Medical Record and Genomics (eMERGE) Network are to learn how best to return research results to patient/participants and the clinicians who care for them and also to assess the impact of placing these results in clinical care. Yet since its inception, the Network has confronted a host of challenges in achieving these goals, many of which had ethical, legal, or social implications (ELSIs) that required consideration. Here, we share impediments we encountered in recruiting participants, returning results, and assessing their impact, all of which affected our ability to achieve the goals of eMERGE, as well as the steps we took to attempt to address these obstacles. We divide the domains in which we experienced challenges into four broad categories: (1) study design, including recruitment of more diverse groups; (2) consent; (3) returning results to participants and their health care providers (HCPs); and (4) assessment of follow-up care of participants and measuring the impact of research on participants and their families. Since most phases of eMERGE have included children as well as adults, we also address the particular ELSI posed by including pediatric populations in this research. We make specific suggestions for improving translational genomic research to ensure that future projects can effectively return results and assess their impact on patient/participants and providers if the goals of genomic-informed medicine are to be achieved.","Clayton, Ellen Wright; Smith, Maureen E; Anderson, Katherine C; Chung, Wendy K; Connolly, John J; Fullerton, Stephanie M; McGowan, Michelle L; Peterson, Josh F; Prows, Cynthia A; Sabatello, Maya; Holm, Ingrid A",American journal of human genetics,2023,"Child; Adult; Humans; Electronic Health Records; Genomics; Genome; Translational Research, Biomedical; Population Groups",ethics; genomics; research design; return of results; translational research,"Center for Biomedical Ethics and Society, Departments of Pediatrics and Health Policy, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.

Development and evaluation of machine learning models. Electronic health record data were extracted from AoU for 1,231 adults diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma. The single-center model was applied to AoU data for external validation. AoU data were then used to train new models for predicting the need for glaucoma surgery using multivariable logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and random forests. Five-fold cross-validation was performed. Model performance was evaluated based on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, and recall. The mean (standard deviation) age of the AoU cohort was 69.1 (10.5) years, with 57.3% women and 33.5% black, significantly exceeding representation in the single-center cohort (P = .04 and P < .001, respectively). Of 1,231 participants, 286 (23.2%) needed glaucoma surgery. When applying the single-center model to AoU data, accuracy was 0.69 and AUC was only 0.49. Using AoU data to train new models resulted in superior performance: AUCs ranged from 0.80 (logistic regression) to 0.99 (random forests).

All of Us,39444500,"US public health surveillance, reimagined.","This study presents two novel concepts for standardizing electronic health records (EHR)-based public health surveillance through utilization of existing informatics methods and data platforms. Drawing from the collective experience in applied epidemiology, health services research and health informatics, the author presents a vision for an alternative path to public health surveillance by repurposing existing tools and resources, such as (1) computable phenotypes which have already been created and validated for a variety of chronic diseases of interest to public health and (2) large data platforms/collaboratives, such as All of Us Research Program and National COVID Cohort Collaborative. Opportunities and challenges are discussed regarding EHR-based chronic disease surveillance, as well as the concept of phenotype definitions and large data platforms reuse for public health needs. Reusing of computable phenotypes for EHR-based public health surveillance would require secure data platforms and nationally representative data. Standardization metrics for reuse of previously developed and validated computable phenotypes are also necessary and are currently being developed by the author. This study presents a reimagined Learning Health System framework by incorporating Public Health and two novel concept sets of solutions into the healthcare ecosystem. Alternative approaches to limited resources and current infrastructure of the US Public Health System, especially as applied to disease surveillance, are needed and may be possible when repurposing the resources and methodologies across the Learning Health System.","Guralnik, Elina",Learning health systems,2024,,computable phenotypes; electronic health records; public health surveillance,"Department of Health Administration and Policy College of Public Health, George Mason University Fairfax VA USA.",10.1002/lrh2.10445

Older individuals are at increased risk of late presentation, represent a growing proportion of people with late presentation, and might require interventions tailored to their age group. We provide a summary of the literature published globally between 2016-21 (reporting data from 1984-2018) and quantify the association of age with delayed presentation. Using the most common definitions of late presentation and older age from these earlier studies, we update this work with data from the International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) consortium, focusing on data from 2000-19, encompassing four continents.

All of Us,36762761,Toward better diabetes care: Exploration and implementation.,"Approximately 40 years ago, I was fortunate enough to step into the field of diabetes. When I had my fellowship training in the USA, I learned how to ask a good scientific question and conduct clinical research. With collaboration with my mentors, Prof. Gerald R Reaven and Prof. Ida Chen, we participated in many clinical trials. We established the Taiwan Diabetes Registry (TDR) to track long-term changes in diabetes profiles. The ultimate purpose of medical research is to provide benefits to patients. Using electronic medical records and point-of-care glucometers, we reduced inpatients' hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia greatly, which was also reflected by the reduction in hospital stays and readmission rates. With the advent of new technology and medications, we have to ponder where we are on the journey toward better diabetes care. We rigorously advocate diabetes care, hold many symposia and publish updated guidelines. We successfully hosted the congress of the 11th International Diabetes Federation Western Pacific Region & 8th Asian Association for the Study of Diabetes Scientific Meeting 2016 at Taipei, Taiwan. As the era of precision medicine is coming, Taiwan could be considered as one of the best places to run precision medicine. The Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative has enrolled more than half a million residents, and is currently conducting genotyping and data analysis. In conclusion. I witnessed the early days of simple and few choices for diabetes management to the current various modalities in diabetes care.

All of Us,39505999,Algorithms for the identification of prevalent diabetes in the All of Us Research Program validated using polygenic scores.,"The All of Us Research Program (AoU) is an initiative designed to gather a comprehensive and diverse dataset from at least one million individuals across the USA. This longitudinal cohort study aims to advance research by providing a rich resource of genetic and phenotypic information, enabling powerful studies on the epidemiology and genetics of human diseases. One critical challenge to maximizing its use is the development of accurate algorithms that can efficiently and accurately identify well-defined disease and disease-free participants for case-control studies. This study aimed to develop and validate type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) algorithms in the AoU cohort, using electronic health record (EHR) and survey data. Building on existing algorithms and using diagnosis codes, medications, laboratory results, and survey data, we developed and implemented algorithms for identifying prevalent cases of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The first set of algorithms used only EHR data (EHR-only), and the second set used a combination of EHR and survey data (EHR+). A universal algorithm was also developed to identify individuals without diabetes. The performance of each algorithm was evaluated by testing its association with polygenic scores (PSs) for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We demonstrated the feasibility and utility of using AoU EHR and survey data to employ diabetes algorithms. For T1D, the EHR-only algorithm showed a stronger association with T1D-PS compared to the EHR + algorithm (DeLong p-value = 3 × 10","Szczerbinski, Lukasz; Mandla, Ravi; Schroeder, Philip; Porneala, Bianca C; Li, Josephine H; Florez, Jose C; Mercader, Josep M; Udler, Miriam S; Manning, Alisa K",Scientific reports,2024,"Humans; Algorithms; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Electronic Health Records; Multifactorial Inheritance; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Male; Middle Aged; Adult; United States; Prevalence; Longitudinal Studies; Aged; Case-Control Studies",,"Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Bialystok, 15-276, Bialystok, Poland.; Clinical Research Centre, Medical University of Bialystok, 15-276, Bialystok, Poland.; Programs in Metabolism and Medical & Population Genetics, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, 415 Main St., Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.; Diabetes Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.; Programs in Metabolism and Medical & Population Genetics, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, 415 Main St., Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.; Diabetes Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.; Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine and Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, USA.; Programs in Metabolism and Medical & Population Genetics, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, 415 Main St., Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.; Diabetes Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.; Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.; Programs in Metabolism and Medical & Population Genetics, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, 415 Main St., Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.; Diabetes Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Programs in Metabolism and Medical & Population Genetics, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, 415 Main St., Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.; Diabetes Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Programs in Metabolism and Medical & Population Genetics, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, 415 Main St., Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA. mercader@broadinstitute.org.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA. mercader@broadinstitute.org.; Diabetes Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA. mercader@broadinstitute.org.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. mercader@broadinstitute.org.; Programs in Metabolism and Medical & Population Genetics, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, 415 Main St., Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA.

All of Us,38095106,Prediction of Venous Thromboembolism in Diverse Populations Using Machine Learning and Structured Electronic Health Records.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current risk assessment tools, such as the Caprini and Padua scores and Wells criteria, have limitations in their applicability and accuracy. This study aimed to develop machine learning models using structured electronic health record data to predict diagnosis and 1-year risk of VTE. We trained and validated models on data from 159 001 participants in the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse. We then externally tested them on 401 723 participants in the UK Biobank and 123 039 participants in All of Us. All data sets contain populations of diverse ancestries and clinical histories. We used these data sets to develop small, medium, and large models with increasing features on a range of optimizing portability to maximizing performance. We make trained models publicly available in click-and-run format at https://doi.org/10.17632/tkwzysr4y6.6. In the holdout and external test sets, respectively, models achieved areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 to 0.83 and 0.72 to 0.82 for VTE diagnosis prediction and 0.76 to 0.78 and 0.64 to 0.69 for 1-year risk prediction, significantly outperforming the Padua score. Models also demonstrated robust performance across different VTE types and patient subsets, including ethnicity, age, and surgical and hospitalization status. Models identified both established and novel clinical features contributing to VTE risk, offering valuable insights into its underlying pathophysiology. Machine learning models using structured electronic health record data can significantly improve VTE diagnosis and 1-year risk prediction in diverse populations. Model probability scores exist on a continuum, affecting mortality risk in both healthy individuals and VTE cases. Integrating these models into electronic health record systems to generate real-time predictions may enhance VTE risk assessment, early detection, and preventative measures, ultimately reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with VTE.","Chen, Robert; Petrazzini, Ben Omega; Malick, Waqas A; Rosenson, Robert S; Do, Ron","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2024,Humans; Electronic Health Records; Risk Factors; Venous Thromboembolism; Population Health; Risk Assessment; Machine Learning; Retrospective Studies,machine learning; medical records; morbidity; risk assessment; thrombosis,"Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine (R.C., B.O.P., R.D.), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.; Medical Scientist Training Program (R.C.), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences (R.C., B.O.P., R.D.), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.; Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine (R.C., B.O.P., R.D.), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences (R.C., B.O.P., R.D.), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.; Center for Genomic Data Analytics (B.O.P., R.D.), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.; The Zena and Michael A.

All of Us,38263490,Comparison of phenomic profiles in the All of Us Research Program against the US general population and the UK Biobank.,"Knowledge gained from cohort studies has dramatically advanced both public and precision health. The All of Us Research Program seeks to enroll 1 million diverse participants who share multiple sources of data, providing unique opportunities for research. It is important to understand the phenomic profiles of its participants to conduct research in this cohort. More than 280 000 participants have shared their electronic health records (EHRs) in the All of Us Research Program. We aim to understand the phenomic profiles of this cohort through comparisons with those in the US general population and a well-established nation-wide cohort, UK Biobank, and to test whether association results of selected commonly studied diseases in the All of Us cohort were comparable to those in UK Biobank. We included participants with EHRs in All of Us and participants with health records from UK Biobank. The estimates of prevalence of diseases in the US general population were obtained from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) study. We conducted phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) of 9 commonly studied diseases in both cohorts. This study included 287 012 participants from the All of Us EHR cohort and 502 477 participants from the UK Biobank. A total of 314 diseases curated by the GBD were evaluated in All of Us, 80.9% (N = 254) of which were more common in All of Us than in the US general population [prevalence ratio (PR) >1.1, P < 2 × 10-5]. Among 2515 diseases and phenotypes evaluated in both All of Us and UK Biobank, 85.6% (N = 2152) were more common in All of Us (PR >1.1, P < 2 × 10-5). The Pearson correlation coefficients of effect sizes from PheWAS between All of Us and UK Biobank were 0.61, 0.50, 0.60, 0.57, 0.40, 0.53, 0.46, 0.47, and 0.24 for ischemic heart diseases, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, colorectal cancer, lower back pain, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and cystic fibrosis, respectively. Despite the differences in prevalence of diseases in All of Us compared to the US general population or the UK Biobank, our study supports that All of Us can facilitate rapid investigation of a broad range of diseases. Most diseases were more common in All of Us than in the general US population or the UK Biobank. Results of disease-disease association tests from All of Us are comparable to those estimated in another well-studied national cohort.","Zeng, Chenjie; Schlueter, David J; Tran, Tam C; Babbar, Anav; Cassini, Thomas; Bastarache, Lisa A; Denny, Josh C",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Humans; Phenomics; Biological Specimen Banks; UK Biobank; Population Health; Phenotype; United Kingdom,All of Us Research Program; Electronic Health Records; UK Biobank; cohort; phenome-wide association studies; prevalence,"National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.; Department of Health and Society, University of Toronto, Scarborough, Toronto, ON, Canada.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, United States.; Center for Precision Medicine, Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.",10.1093/jamia/ocad260

All of Us,37971726,Social Determinants of Health and Perceived Barriers to Care in Diabetic Retinopathy Screening.,"Regular screening for diabetic retinopathy often is crucial for the health of patients with diabetes. However, many factors may be barriers to regular screening and associated with disparities in screening rates. To evaluate the associations between visiting an eye care practitioner for diabetic retinopathy screening and factors related to overall health and social determinants of health, including socioeconomic status and health care access and utilization. This retrospective cross-sectional study included adults aged 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes who answered survey questions in the All of Us Research Program, a national multicenter cohort of patients contributing electronic health records and survey data, who were enrolled from May 1, 2018, to July 1, 2022. The associations between visiting an eye care practitioner and (1) demographic and socioeconomic factors and (2) responses to the Health Care Access and Utilization, Social Determinants of Health, and Overall Health surveys were investigated using univariable and multivariable logistic regressions. The primary outcome was whether patients self-reported visiting an eye care practitioner in the past 12 months. The associations between visiting an eye care practitioner and demographic and socioeconomic factors and responses to the Health Care Access and Utilization, Social Determinants of Health, and Overall Health surveys in All of Us were investigated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Of the 11 551 included participants (54.55% cisgender women; mean [SD] age, 64.71 [11.82] years), 7983 (69.11%) self-reported visiting an eye care practitioner in the past year. Individuals who thought practitioner concordance was somewhat or very important were less likely to have seen an eye care practitioner (somewhat important: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.93]; very important: AOR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.76-0.95]). Compared with financially stable participants, individuals with food or housing insecurity were less likely to visit an eye care practitioner (food insecurity: AOR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.61-0.91]; housing insecurity: AOR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75-0.98]). Individuals who reported fair mental health were less likely to visit an eye care practitioner than were those who reported good mental health (AOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.96). This study found that food insecurity, housing insecurity, mental health concerns, and the perceived importance of practitioner concordance were associated with a lower likelihood of receiving eye care. Such findings highlight the self-reported barriers to seeking care and the importance of taking steps to promote health equity.","Ravindranath, Rohith; Bernstein, Isaac A; Fernandez, Karen S; Ludwig, Cassie A; Wang, Sophia Y",JAMA ophthalmology,2023,"Adult; Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Diabetic Retinopathy; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Social Determinants of Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Retrospective Studies; Health Promotion; Population Health; Health Services Accessibility",,"Department of Ophthalmology, Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California.; Department of Ophthalmology, Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California.; Department of Ophthalmology, Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California.; Department of Ophthalmology, Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California.; Department of Ophthalmology, Byers Eye Institute, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California.",10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2023.5287

Including these populations in precision medicine research is critical for scientific benefits to accrue to them. We assessed representation of blind and deaf people in the All of Us Research Program (AoURP) 2018-2023 cohort of participants who provided electronic health records and compared it with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2018 national estimates by key demographic characteristics and intersections thereof. Blind and deaf AoURP participants are considerably underrepresented in the cohort, especially among working-age adults (younger than age 65 years), as well as Asian and multi-racial participants. Analyses show compounded underrepresentation at the intersection of multiple marginalization (that is, racial or ethnic minoritized group, female sex, low education and low income), most substantively for working-age blind participants identifying as Black or African American female with education levels lower than high school (representing one-fifth of their national prevalence). Underrepresentation raises concerns about the generalizability of findings in studies that use these data and limited benefits for the already underserved blind and deaf populations.","Lewis V, Colby; Huebner, Jack; Hripcsak, George; Sabatello, Maya",Nature medicine,2023,Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Black or African American; Ethnicity; Population Health; Racial Groups; Middle Aged; Blindness; Deafness; Health Disparate Minority and Vulnerable Populations; Asian; United States; Male; Sex Factors; Social Determinants of Health; Educational Status,,"Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Precision Medicine and Genomics, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. ms4075@cumc.columbia.edu.; Division of Ethics, Department of Medical Humanities & Ethics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. ms4075@cumc.columbia.edu.",10.1038/s41591-023-02607-x

Participant-provided information, collected via surveys, will complement and augment these information sources. We report the process used to develop and refine the initial three surveys for this program. The All of Us survey development process included: (1) prioritization of domains for scientific needs, (2) examination of existing validated instruments, (3) content creation, (4) evaluation and refinement via cognitive interviews and online testing, (5) content review by key stakeholders, and (6) launch in the All of Us electronic participant portal. All content was translated into Spanish. We conducted cognitive interviews in English and Spanish with 169 participants, and 573 individuals completed online testing. Feedback led to over 40 item content changes. Lessons learned included: (1) validated survey instruments performed well in diverse populations reflective of All of Us; (2) parallel evaluation of multiple languages can ensure optimal survey deployment; (3) recruitment challenges in diverse populations required multiple strategies; and (4) key stakeholders improved integration of surveys into larger Program context. This efficient, iterative process led to successful testing, refinement, and launch of three All of Us surveys.

All of Us,40133288,Leveraging large-scale biobank EHRs to enhance pharmacogenetics of cardiometabolic disease medications.,"Electronic health records (EHRs) coupled with large-scale biobanks offer great promises to unravel the genetic underpinnings of treatment efficacy. However, medication-induced biomarker trajectories stemming from such records remain poorly studied. Here, we extract clinical and medication prescription data from EHRs and conduct GWAS and rare variant burden tests in the UK Biobank (discovery) and the All of Us program (replication) on ten cardiometabolic drug response outcomes including lipid response to statins, HbA1c response to metformin and blood pressure response to antihypertensives (N = 932-28,880). Our discovery analyses in participants of European ancestry recover previously reported pharmacogenetic signals at genome-wide significance level (APOE, LPA and SLCO1B1) and a novel rare variant association in GIMAP5 with HbA1c response to metformin. Importantly, these associations are treatment-specific and not associated with biomarker progression in medication-naive individuals. We also found polygenic risk scores to predict drug response, though they explained less than 2% of the variance. In summary, we present an EHR-based framework to study the genetics of drug response and systematically investigated the common and rare pharmacogenetic contribution to cardiometabolic drug response phenotypes in 41,732 UK Biobank and 14,277 All of Us participants.","Sadler, Marie C; Apostolov, Alexander; Cevallos, Caterina; Auwerx, Chiara; Ribeiro, Diogo M; Altman, Russ B; Kutalik, Zoltán",Nature communications,2025,"Humans; Electronic Health Records; Biological Specimen Banks; Genome-Wide Association Study; Pharmacogenetics; Male; Female; Cardiovascular Diseases; Middle Aged; Metformin; United Kingdom; Aged; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Glycated Hemoglobin; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Antihypertensive Agents",,"University Center for Primary Care and Public Health, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Computational Biology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Computational Biology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; University Center for Primary Care and Public Health, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Computational Biology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Computational Biology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; University Center for Primary Care and Public Health, Lausanne, Switzerland. zoltan.kutalik@unil.ch.; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland. zoltan.kutalik@unil.ch.; Department of Computational Biology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland. zoltan.kutalik@unil.ch.",10.1038/s41467-025-58152-3

All of Us,39254529,Navigating electronic health record accuracy by examination of sex incongruent conditions.,"The increasing reliance on electronic health records (EHRs) for research and clinical care necessitates robust methods for assessing data quality and identifying inconsistencies. To address this need, we develop and apply the incongruence rate (IR) using sex-specific medical conditions. We also characterized participants with incongruent records to better understand the scope and nature of data discrepancies. In this cross-sectional study, we used the All of Us Research Program's latest version 7 (v7) EHR data to identify prevalent sex-specific conditions and evaluated the occurrence of incongruent cases, quantified as IR. Among the 92 597 males and 152 551 females with condition occurrence data available from All of Us and sex-conformed gender, we identified 167 prevalent sex-specific conditions. Among the 37 537 biological males and 95 499 biological females with these sex-specific conditions, we detected an overall IR of 0.86%. Attempt to include non-cisgender participants result in inflated overall IR. Additionally, a significant proportion of participants with incongruent conditions also presented with conditions congruent to their biological sex, indicating a mix of accurate and erroneous records. These incongruences were not geographically or temporally isolated, suggesting systematic issues in EHR data integrity. Our findings call attention to the existence of systemic data incongruences in sex-specific conditions and the need for robust validation checks. Extending IR evaluation to non-cisgender participants or non-sex-based conditions remain a challenge. The sex condition-specific IR, when applied to adult populations, provides a valuable metric for data quality assessment in EHRs.","Cai, Ling; DeBerardinis, Ralph J; Zhan, Xiaowei; Xiao, Guanghua; Xie, Yang",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Humans; Electronic Health Records; Male; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Accuracy; Adult; Middle Aged; Sex Factors; Young Adult; Adolescent; United States; Aged,All of Us; disconcordant; electronic health records; quality assessment; sex,"Quantitative Biomedical Research Center, Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.; Children's Research Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.; Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.; Children's Research Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.; Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.; Quantitative Biomedical Research Center, Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.; Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.; Center for Genetics of Host Defense, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.; Quantitative Biomedical Research Center, Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.; Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.; Department of Bioinformatics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.; Quantitative Biomedical Research Center, Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.; Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.; Department of Bioinformatics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, United States.",10.1093/jamia/ocae236

All of Us,36803322,Selection of cognitive impairment screening tools for longitudinal implementation in an HIV clinical care setting.,"To address and slow the increasing burden of cognitive impairment in people surviving to older ages with HIV requires longitudinal monitoring of cognition. We conducted a structured literature review to identify peer-reviewed studies employing validated cognitive impairment screening tools in adult populations of people with HIV. We identified three key criteria for selection and ranking of a tool: (a) strength of validity of the tool; (b) acceptability and feasibility of the tool; (c) ownership of the data from the assessment. From our structured review of 105, 29 studies met our inclusion criteria, within which 10 cognitive impairment screening measurement tools were validated in a population of people with HIV. The BRACE, NeuroScreen and NCAD tools were ranked highly when compared with the other seven tools. Additionally, patient population and clinical setting characteristics (such as availability of quiet space, timing of assessment, security of electronic resources, and ease of linkage to electronic health records) were included in our framework for selection of tools. Numerous validated cognitive impairment screening tools are available to monitor for cognitive changes in the HIV clinical care setting, detecting opportunities for earlier intervention to reduce cognitive decline and preserve quality of life.","Dantuluri, Meghana L; Rubin, Leah H; Manabe, Yukari C; Moore, Richard D; Althoff, Keri N",AIDS care,2023,Adult; Humans; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Cognitive Dysfunction; HIV Infections; Quality of Life,HIV; cognitive impairment; screening,"Department of General Internal Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of General Internal Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.",10.1080/09540121.2023.2165614
All of Us,37636340,Subtyping Social Determinants of Health in ,"Social determinants of health (SDoH), such as financial resources and housing stability, account for between 30-55% of people's health outcomes. While many studies have identified strong associations among specific SDoH and health outcomes, most people experience multiple SDoH that impact their daily lives. Analysis of this complexity requires the integration of personal, clinical, social, and environmental information from a large cohort of individuals that have been traditionally underrepresented in research, which is only recently being made available through the  To address two research questions: (1) What is the range and response to survey questions related to SDoH in the  For Question-1, an expert panel analyzed the range of SDoH questions across the surveys with respect to the 5 domains in  For Question-1, we identified 110 SDoH questions across 4 surveys, which covered all 5 domains in  The results revealed that the SDoH subtypes not only had statistically significant clustering and replicability, but also had significant associations with critical adverse health outcomes, which had translational implications for designing targeted SDoH interventions, decision-support systems to alert clinicians of potential risks, and for public policies.

All of Us,39058572,Multi-modality risk prediction of cardiovascular diseases for breast cancer cohort in the All of Us Research Program.,"This study leverages the rich diversity of the All of Us Research Program (All of Us)'s dataset to devise a predictive model for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in breast cancer (BC) survivors. Central to this endeavor is the creation of a robust data integration pipeline that synthesizes electronic health records (EHRs), patient surveys, and genomic data, while upholding fairness across demographic variables. We have developed a universal data wrangling pipeline to process and merge heterogeneous data sources of the All of Us dataset, address missingness and variance in data, and align disparate data modalities into a coherent framework for analysis. Utilizing a composite feature set including EHR, lifestyle, and social determinants of health (SDoH) data, we then employed Adaptive Lasso and Random Forest regression models to predict 6 CVD outcomes. The models were evaluated using the c-index and time-dependent Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve over a 10-year period. The Adaptive Lasso model showed consistent performance across most CVD outcomes, while the Random Forest model excelled particularly in predicting outcomes like transient ischemic attack when incorporating the full multi-model feature set. Feature importance analysis revealed age and previous coronary events as dominant predictors across CVD outcomes, with SDoH clustering labels highlighting the nuanced impact of social factors. The development of both Cox-based predictive model and Random Forest Regression model represents the extensive application of the All of Us, in integrating EHR and patient surveys to enhance precision medicine. And the inclusion of SDoH clustering labels revealed the significant impact of sociobehavioral factors on patient outcomes, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive health determinants in predictive models. Despite these advancements, limitations include the exclusion of genetic data, broad categorization of CVD conditions, and the need for fairness analyses to ensure equitable model performance across diverse populations. Future work should refine clinical and social variable measurements, incorporate advanced imputation techniques, and explore additional predictive algorithms to enhance model precision and fairness. This study demonstrates the liability of the All of Us's diverse dataset in developing a multi-modality predictive model for CVD in BC survivors risk stratification in oncological survivorship. The data integration pipeline and subsequent predictive models establish a methodological foundation for future research into personalized healthcare.","Yang, Han; Zhou, Sicheng; Rao, Zexi; Zhao, Chen; Cui, Erjia; Shenoy, Chetan; Blaes, Anne H; Paidimukkala, Nishitha; Wang, Jinhua; Hou, Jue; Zhang, Rui",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Humans; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Electronic Health Records; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; United States; Aged; Cancer Survivors; Social Determinants of Health; Datasets as Topic; ROC Curve,All of Us; breast cancer; cardiovascular disease; predictive model,"Institute for Health Informatics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States.; Institute for Health Informatics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States.; Division of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States.; Division of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States.; Division of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States.; Cardiovascular Division, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States.; Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States.; Institute for Health Informatics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States.; Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States.; Division of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States.; Division of Computational Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, United States.",10.1093/jamia/ocae199
All of Us,39321407,Brain Health Outcomes in Sexual and Gender Minority Groups: Results From the All of Us Research Program.,"Sexual and gender minority (SGM) groups have been historically underrepresented in neurologic research, and their brain health disparities are unknown. We aim to evaluate whether SGM persons are at higher risk of adverse brain health outcomes compared with cisgender straight (non-SGM) individuals. We conducted a cross-sectional study in the All of Us Research Program, a US population-based study, including all participants with information on gender identity and sexual orientation. We used baseline questionnaires to identify sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, diverse sexual orientation; nonstraight sexual orientation) and gender minority (gender diverse and transgender; gender identity different from sex assigned at birth) participants. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke, dementia, and late-life depression, assessed using electronic health record data and self-report. Secondarily, we evaluated each disease separately. Furthermore, we evaluated all subgroups of gender and sexual minorities stratified by sex assigned at birth. We used multivariable logistic regression (adjusted for age, sex assigned at birth, race/ethnicity, cardiovascular risk factors, other relevant comorbidities, and neighborhood deprivation index) to assess the relationship between SGM groups and the outcomes. Of 413,457 US adults enrolled between May 31, 2017, and June 30, 2022, we included 393,041 participants with available information on sexual orientation and gender identity (mean age 51 [SD 17] years), of whom 39,632 (10%) belonged to SGM groups. Of them, 38,528 (97%) belonged to a sexual minority and 4,431 (11%) to a gender minority. Compared with non-SGM, SGM persons had 15% higher odds of the brain health composite outcome (odds ratio [OR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.08-1.22). In secondary analyses, these results persisted across sexual and gender minorities separately (all 95% CIs > 1). Assessing individual diseases, all SGM groups had higher odds of dementia (SGM vs non-SGM: OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.29) and late-life depression (SGM vs non-SGM: OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.17-1.38) and transgender women had higher odds of stroke (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.04-2.70). In a large US population study, SGM persons had higher odds of adverse brain health outcomes. Further research should explore structural causes of inequity to advance inclusive and diverse neurologic care.","Huo, Shufan; Rivier, Cyprien A; Clocchiatti-Tuozzo, Santiago; Renedo, Daniela; Sunmonu, N Abimbola;

We sought to evaluate antihypertensive drug effectiveness and prescribing patterns among self-identified Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic), Non-Hispanic Black (Black), and Non-Hispanic White (White) populations that enrolled in the NIH All of Us Research Program, a US longitudinal cohort. We employed a self-controlled case study method using electronic health record and survey data from 17,718 White, Hispanic, and Black participants who were diagnosed with essential hypertension and prescribed at least one of 19 commonly used antihypertensive medications. Effectiveness was determined by calculating the reduction in systolic blood pressure measurements after 28 or more days of drug exposure. Starting systolic blood pressure and effectiveness for each medication were compared for self-reported Black, Hispanic, and White participants using adjusted linear regressions. Black and Hispanic participants were started on antihypertensive medications at significantly higher SBP than White participants in 13 and 7 out of 19 medications, respectively. More Black participants were prescribed multiple antihypertensive medications (58.46%) than White (52.35%) or Hispanic (49.9%) participants. First-line HTN medications differed by race and ethnicity. Following the 2017 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association High Blood Pressure Guideline release, around 64% of Black participants were prescribed a recommended first-line antihypertensive drug compared with 76% of White and 82% of Hispanic participants. Effect sizes suggested that most antihypertensive drugs were less effective in Hispanic and Black, compared with White, participants, and statistical significance was reached in 6 out of 19 drugs. These results indicate that Black and Hispanic populations may benefit from earlier intervention and screening and highlight the potential benefits of personalizing first-line medications.","Goleva, Slavina B; Williams, Ariel; Schlueter, David J; Keaton, Jacob M; Tran, Tam C; Waxse, Bennett J; Ferrara, Tracey M; Cassini, Thomas; Mo, Huan; Denny, Joshua C",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2024,"Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Black or African American; Blood Pressure; Ethnicity; Healthcare Disparities; Hispanic or Latino; Hypertension; Longitudinal Studies; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Treatment Outcome; United States; White",,"National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Department of Health and Society, University of Toronto Scarborough, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Division of Medical Genetics and Genomic Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Cohort Analytics Core, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; All of Us Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.",10.1002/cpt.3360
All of Us,39108513,Population Performance and Individual Agreement of Coronary Artery Disease Polygenic Risk Scores.,"Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for coronary artery disease (CAD) are a growing clinical and commercial reality. Whether existing scores provide similar individual-level assessments of disease liability is a critical consideration for clinical implementation that remains uncharacterized. Characterize the reliability of CAD PRSs that perform equivalently at the population level at predicting individual-level risk. Cross-sectional Study. All of Us Research Program (AOU), Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB), and UCLA ATLAS Precision Health Biobank. Volunteers of diverse genetic backgrounds enrolled in AOU, PMBB, and UCLA with available electronic health record and genotyping data. Polygenic risk for CAD from previously published PRSs and new PRSs developed separately from the testing cohorts. Sets of CAD PRSs that perform population prediction equivalently were identified by comparing calibration and discrimination (Brier score and AUROC) of generalized linear models of prevalent CAD using Bayesian analysis of variance. Among equivalently performing scores, individual-level agreement between risk estimates was tested with intraclass correlation (ICC) and Light's Kappa, measures of inter-rater reliability. 50 PRSs were calculated for 171,095 AOU participants. When included in a model of prevalent CAD, 48 scores had practically equivalent Brier scores and AUROCs (region of practical equivalence = 0.02). Across these scores, 84% of participants had at least one score in both the top and bottom risk quintile. Continuous agreement of individual risk predictions from the 48 scores was poor, with an ICC of 0.351 (95% CI; 0.349, 0.352). Agreement between two statistically equivalent scores was moderate, with an ICC of 0.649 (95% CI; 0.646, 0.652). Light's Kappa, used to evaluate consistency of assignment to high-risk thresholds, did not exceed 0.56 (interpreted as 'fair') across statistically and practically equivalent scores. Repeating the analysis among 41,193 PMBB and 50,748 UCLA participants yielded different sets of statistically and practically equivalent scores which also lacked strong individual agreement. Across three diverse biobanks, CAD PRSs that performed equivalently at the population level produced unreliable individual risk estimates. Approaches to clinical implementation of CAD PRSs must consider the potential for discordant individual risk estimates from otherwise indistinguishable scores.","Abramowitz, Sarah A; Boulier, Kristin; Keat, Karl; Cardone, Katie M; Shivakumar, Manu; DePaolo, John; Judy, Renae; Kim, Dokyoon; Rader, Daniel J; Ritchie, Marylyn D; Voight, Benjamin F; Pasaniuc, Bogdan; Levin, Michael G; Damrauer, Scott M",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024,,,,10.1101/2024.07.25.24310931
All of Us,35396991,Comparing medical history data derived from electronic health records and survey answers in the All of Us Research Program.,"A participant's medical history is important in clinical research and can be captured from electronic health records (EHRs) and self-reported surveys. Both can be incomplete, EHR due to documentation gaps or lack of interoperability and surveys due to recall bias or limited health literacy. This analysis compares medical history collected in the All of Us Research Program through both surveys and EHRs. The All of Us medical history survey includes self-report questionnaire that asks about diagnoses to over 150 medical conditions organized into 12 disease categories. In each category, we identified the 3 most and least frequent self-reported diagnoses and retrieved their analogues from EHRs. We calculated agreement scores and extracted participant demographic characteristics for each comparison set. The 4th All of Us dataset release includes data from 314 994 participants; 28.3% of whom completed medical history surveys, and 65.5% of whom had EHR data. Hearing and vision category within the survey had the highest number of responses, but the second lowest positive agreement with the EHR (0.21). The Infectious disease category had the lowest positive agreement (0.12). Cancer conditions had the highest positive agreement (0.45) between the 2 data sources. Our study quantified the agreement of medical history between 2 sources-EHRs and self-reported surveys. Conditions that are usually undocumented in EHRs had low agreement scores, demonstrating that survey data can supplement EHR data. Disagreement between EHR and survey can help identify possible missing records and guide researchers to adjust for biases.","Sulieman, Lina; Cronin, Robert M; Carroll, Robert J; Natarajan, Karthik; Marginean, Kayla; Mapes, Brandy; Roden, Dan; Harris, Paul; Ramirez, Andrea",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2022,Documentation; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Population Health; Surveys and Questionnaires,All of Us; electronic health records; medical history; phenotype; survey,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.; Vanderbilt Institute of Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Vanderbilt Institute of Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Vanderbilt Institute of Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Office of data and analytics, All of Us Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.",10.1093/jamia/ocac046

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the five most commonly prescribed antibiotics in the United States are azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, cephalexin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. We quantified the frequency of acute DILI for these common antibiotics in the All of Us Research Program, one of the largest electronic health record (EHR)-linked research cohorts in the United States. Retrospective analyses were conducted applying a standardized phenotyping algorithm to de-identified clinical data available in the All of Us database for 318,598 study participants. Between February 1984 and December 2022, more than 30% of All of Us participants (n = 119,812 individuals) had been exposed to at least 1 of our 5 study drugs. Initial screening identified 591 potential case patients that met our preselected laboratory-based phenotyping criteria. Because DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion, we then used phenome scanning to narrow the case counts by (i) scanning all EHRs to identify all alternative diagnostic explanations for the laboratory abnormalities, and (ii) leveraging International Classification of Disease 9th revision (ICD)-9 and ICD 10th revision (ICD)-10 codes as exclusion criteria to eliminate misclassification. Our final case counts were 30 DILI cases with amoxicillin-clavulanate, 24 cases with azithromycin, 24 cases with ciprofloxacin, 22 cases with amoxicillin alone, and < 20 cases with cephalexin. These findings demonstrate that data from EHR-linked research cohorts can be efficiently mined to identify DILI cases related to the use of common antibiotics.","Gu, Shaopeng; Rajendiran, Govarthanan; Forest, Kennedy; Tran, Tam C; Denny, Joshua C; Larson, Eric A; Wilke, Russell A",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2023,Humans; United States; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Azithromycin; Retrospective Studies; Population Health; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Amoxicillin-Potassium Clavulanate Combination; Amoxicillin; Ciprofloxacin; Cephalexin,,"Department of Internal Medicine, Sanford School of Medicine, University of South Dakota, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA.; Sanford Imagenetics, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Sanford School of Medicine, University of South Dakota, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA.; Section of Gastroenterology/Hepatology, Sanford Medical Center, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Sanford School of Medicine, University of South Dakota, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA.; Center for Precision Health Research, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Center for Precision Health Research, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Sanford School of Medicine, University of South Dakota, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA.; Sanford Imagenetics, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Sanford School of Medicine, University of South Dakota, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA.",10.1002/cpt.2930

This retrospective matched case-control study utilized patient data from the All of Us Research Program. All patients with a KC diagnosis (n = 572) were enrolled in the study and matched with three controls (n = 1716) based on age ± 1 year, race, ethnicity, and sex. The patients' medical histories, including diabetes, sleep apnea, obesity, smoking, ocular surface disease (encompassing dry eye, eczema, and allergic or atopic conjunctivitis), allergic rhinitis, pregnancy, estrogen-containing medications, tetracyclines, and vitamin C supplementation, were collected using electronic health records. Multivariable odds ratios (ORs) between KC and health history were calculated using the R programming language. The study included 2288 participants with an average age of 58.7 years. All included variables showed a significant positive correlation with KC except smoking history, which showed a negative correlation. The most significant correlations were ocular surface disease (OR = 6.04) and obesity (OR = 1.82). Significant positive associations were also identified for tetracyclines and estrogen-containing medications with KC. Smoking was negatively correlated. In addition to previously known risk factors, patients with a history of increased estrogen exposure and tetracycline usage were more likely to have a KC diagnosis whereas those with a smoking history were less likely. Understanding the risk factors for KC, including estrogen exposure and tetracycline medications, enhances our ability to identify at-risk patients and implement earlier screening, diagnosis, and interventions.","Beatty, Carol; Estes, Amy; Xu, Hongyan; Liu, Yutao",Translational vision science & technology,2024,"Humans; Female; Male; Case-Control Studies; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Keratoconus; Risk Factors; United States; Adult; Databases, Factual; Aged; Estrogens; Odds Ratio",,"Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA.; Department of Ophthalmology, James and Jean Culver Vision Discovery Institute, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Data Science and Epidemiology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA.; Department of Cellular Biology and Anatomy, Center for Biotechnology and Genomic Medicine, James and Jean Culver Vision Discovery Institute, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA.",10.1167/tvst.13.11.18
All of Us,36809550,Managing re-identification risks while providing access to the All of Us research program.,"The All of Us Research Program makes individual-level data available to researchers while protecting the participants' privacy. This article describes the protections embedded in the multistep access process, with a particular focus on how the data was transformed to meet generally accepted re-identification risk levels. At the time of the study, the resource consisted of 329 084 participants. Systematic amendments were applied to the data to mitigate re-identification risk (eg, generalization of geographic regions, suppression of public events, and randomization of dates). We computed the re-identification risk for each participant using a state-of-the-art adversarial model specifically assuming that it is known that someone is a participant in the program. We confirmed the expected risk is no greater than 0.09, a threshold that is consistent with guidelines from various US state and federal agencies. We further investigated how risk varied as a function of participant demographics. The results indicated that 95th percentile of the re-identification risk of all the participants is below current thresholds. At the same time, we observed that risk levels were higher for certain race, ethnic, and genders. While the re-identification risk was sufficiently low, this does not imply that the system is devoid of risk. Rather, All of Us uses a multipronged data protection strategy that includes strong authentication practices, active monitoring of data misuse, and penalization mechanisms for users who violate terms of service.","Xia, Weiyi; Basford, Melissa; Carroll, Robert; Clayton, Ellen Wright; Harris, Paul; Kantacioglu, Murat; Liu, Yongtai; Nyemba, Steve; Vorobeychik, Yevgeniy; Wan, Zhiyu; Malin, Bradley A",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2023,Humans; Male; Female; Population Health; Privacy; Risk Management; Computer Security; Research Personnel,All of Us Research Program; data privacy; data sharing; electronic health records,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Law School, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Health Policy, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Dallas, Texas, USA.; Department of Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.",10.1093/jamia/ocad021

All of Us,39043412,Pregnancy episodes in All of Us: harnessing multi-source data for pregnancy-related research.,"The National Institutes of Health's All of Us Research Program addresses gaps in biomedical research by collecting health data from diverse populations. Pregnant individuals have historically been underrepresented in biomedical research, and pregnancy-related research is often limited by data availability, sample size, and inadequate representation of the diversity of pregnant people. All of Us integrates a wealth of health-related data, providing a unique opportunity to conduct comprehensive pregnancy-related research. We aimed to identify pregnancy episodes with high-quality electronic health record (EHR) data in All of Us Research Program data and evaluate the program's utility for pregnancy-related research. We used a previously published algorithm to identify pregnancy episodes in All of Us EHR data. We described these pregnancies, validated them with All of Us survey data, and compared them to national statistics. Our study identified 18 970 pregnancy episodes from 14 234 participants; other possible pregnancy episodes had low-quality or insufficient data. Validation against people who reported a current pregnancy on an All of Us survey found low false positive and negative rates. Demographics were similar in some respects to national data; however, Asian-Americans were underrepresented, and older, highly educated pregnant people were overrepresented. Our approach demonstrates the capacity of All of Us to support pregnancy research and reveals the diversity of the pregnancy cohort. However, we noted an underrepresentation among some demographics. Other limitations include measurement error in gestational age and limited data on non-live births. The wide variety of data in the All of Us program, encompassing EHR, survey, genomic, and fitness tracker data, offers a valuable resource for studying pregnancy, yet care must be taken to avoid biases.","Smith, Louisa H; Wang, Wanjiang; Keefe-Oates, Brianna",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Humans; Female; Pregnancy; United States; Electronic Health Records; Adult; Biomedical Research; Algorithms; Young Adult; Adolescent,electronic health records; gestational age; pregnancy; pregnancy outcomes; real-world data,"Department of Public Health and Health Sciences, Bouvé College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, United States.; Roux Institute, Northeastern University, Portland, ME 04101, United States.; Department of Public Health and Health Sciences, Bouvé College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, United States.; Department of Public Health and Health Sciences, Bouvé College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, United States.; Roux Institute, Northeastern University, Portland, ME 04101, United States.",10.1093/jamia/ocae195

This study explores shared loci, and genes between PTSD and CV conditions from three major domains: CV diagnoses from electronic health records (CV-EHR), cardiac and aortic imaging, and CV health behaviors defined in Life's Essential 8 (LE8). We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PTSD (N=1,222,882), 246 CV diagnoses based on EHR data from Million Veteran Program (MVP; N=458,061), UK Biobank (UKBB; N=420,531), 82 cardiac and aortic imaging traits (N=26,893), and GWAS of traits defined in the LE8 (N = 282,271 ~ 1,320,016). Shared loci between PTSD and CV conditions were identified using local genetic correlations (rg), and colocalization (shared causal variants). Overlapping genes between PTSD and CV conditions were identified from genetically regulated proteome expression in brain and blood tissues, and subsequently tested to identify functional pathways and gene-drug targets. Epidemiological replication of EHR-CV diagnoses was performed in AllofUS cohort (AoU; N=249,906). Among the 76 PTSD-susceptibility risk loci, 33 loci exhibited local rg with 45 CV-EHR traits (|rg|≥0.4), four loci with eight heart imaging traits(|rg|≥0.5), and 44 loci with LE8 factors (|rg|≥0.36) in MVP. Among significantly correlated loci, we found shared causal variants (colocalization probability > 80%) between PTSD and 17 CV-EHR (in MVP) at 11 loci in MVP, that also replicated in UKBB and/or other cohorts. Of the 17 traits, the observational analysis in the AoU showed PTSD was associated with 13 CV-EHR traits after accounting for socioeconomic factors and depression diagnosis. PTSD colocalized with eight heart imaging traits on 2 loci and with LE8 factors on 31 loci. Leveraging blood and brain proteome expression, we found 33 and 122 genes, respectively, shared between PTSD and CVD. Blood proteome genes were related to neuronal and immune processes, while the brain proteome genes converged on metabolic and calcium-modulating pathways (FDR p <0.05).

Few studies of AA have adequately included participants from underrepresented groups when evaluating the burden of AA in the United States. We conducted a cross-sectional study of personal/demographic factors and AA using the ongoing All of Us (AoU) Research Program. AoU enrolls adults over 18 years either as direct volunteers or through participating Health Care Provider Organizations by prioritizing recruiting underrepresented groups. We linked data from surveys and electronic health records (EHRs) to estimate the prevalence of AA by race/ethnicity, physical disability, sexual orientation/gender identity (LGBTQIA +), income, and education.

Of these, 251,597 (76.5%) had EHR data and 752 were diagnosed with AA (prevalence, 0.30%; 95% CI 0.28-0.32). We used multivariate logistic regression adjusted for age and other factors to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prevalence of AA. Compared to Whites, Blacks and Hispanics had higher odds of AA (OR, 1.72; 95% CI 1.39-2.11 and OR, 2.13; 95% CI 1.74-2.59, respectively).

All of Us,34941480,Geographic Variation in Obesity at the State Level in the All of Us Research Program.,"National obesity prevention strategies may benefit from precision health approaches involving diverse participants in population health studies. We used cohort data from the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program (All of Us) Researcher Workbench to estimate population-level obesity prevalence. To estimate state-level obesity prevalence we used data from physical measurements made during All of Us enrollment visits and data from participant electronic health records (EHRs) where available. Prevalence estimates were calculated and mapped by state for 2 categories of body mass index (BMI) (kg/m Data on height and weight were available for 244,504 All of Us participants from 33 states, and corresponding EHR data were available for 88,840 of these participants. The median and IQR of BMI taken from physical measurements data was 28.4 (24.4- 33.7) and 28.5 (24.5-33.6) from EHR data, where available. Overall obesity prevalence based on physical measurements data was 41.5% (95% CI, 41.3%-41.7%); prevalence of severe obesity was 20.7% (95% CI, 20.6-20.9), with large geographic variations observed across states. Prevalence estimates from states with greater numbers of All of Us participants were more similar to national population-based estimates than states with fewer participants. All of Us participants had a high prevalence of obesity, with state-level geographic variation mirroring national trends. The diversity among All of Us participants may support future investigations on obesity prevention and treatment in diverse populations.","Clark, Cheryl R; Chandler, Paulette D; Zhou, Guohai; Noel, Nyia; Achilike, Confidence; Mendez, Lizette; O'Connor, George T; Smoller, Jordan W; Weiss, Scott T; Murphy, Shawn N; Ommerborn, Mark J; Karnes, Jason H; Klimentidis, Yann C; Jordan, Christina D; Hiatt, Robert A; Ramirez, Andrea H; Loperena, Roxana; Mayo, Kelsey; Cohn, Elizabeth; Ohno-Machado, Lucila; Boerwinkle, Eric; Cicek, Mine; Schully, Sheri D; Mockrin, Stephen; Gebo, Kelly A; Karlson, Elizabeth W",Preventing chronic disease,2021,"Body Mass Index; Humans; Obesity; Obesity, Morbid; Population Health; Prevalence; United States",,"Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, 1620 Tremont St, 3rd Floor, Boston, MA 02120.

All of Us,33404595,Comparison of family health history in surveys vs electronic health record data mapped to the observational medical outcomes partnership data model in the All of Us Research Program.,"Family health history is important to clinical care and precision medicine. Prior studies show gaps in data collected from patient surveys and electronic health records (EHRs). The All of Us Research Program collects family history from participants via surveys and EHRs. This Demonstration Project aims to evaluate availability of family health history information within the publicly available data from All of Us and to characterize the data from both sources. Surveys were completed by participants on an electronic portal. EHR data was mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership data model. We used descriptive statistics to perform exploratory analysis of the data, including evaluating a list of medically actionable genetic disorders. We performed a subanalysis on participants who had both survey and EHR data. There were 54 872 participants with family history data. Of those, 26% had EHR data only, 63% had survey only, and 10.5% had data from both sources. There were 35 217 participants with reported family history of a medically actionable genetic disorder (9% from EHR only, 89% from surveys, and 2% from both). In the subanalysis, we found inconsistencies between the surveys and EHRs. More details came from surveys. When both mentioned a similar disease, the source of truth was unclear. Compiling data from both surveys and EHR can provide a more comprehensive source for family health history, but informatics challenges and opportunities exist. Access to more complete understanding of a person's family health history may provide opportunities for precision medicine.","Cronin, Robert M; Halvorson, Alese E; Springer, Cassie; Feng, Xiaoke; Sulieman, Lina; Loperena-Cortes, Roxana; Mayo, Kelsey; Carroll, Robert J; Chen, Qingxia; Ahmedani, Brian K; Karnes, Jason; Korf, Bruce; O'Donnell, Christopher J; Qian, Jun; Ramirez, Andrea H",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2021,"Biomedical Research; Electronic Health Records; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; Health Surveys; Humans; Internet; Medical History Taking; Precision Medicine",Family health history; electronic health records; health surveys; precision medicine,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Center for Health Policy and Health Services Research, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan, USA.; Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, University of Arizona College of Pharmacy, Tuscon, Arizona, USA.; Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.; Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.",10.1093/jamia/ocaa315

The meeting's goal was to articulate a research strategy to develop Genomics-based Clinical Informatics Tools and Resources (GCIT) to improve the detection, treatment, and reporting of genetic disorders in clinical settings. Experts from government agencies, the private sector, and academia in genomic medicine and clinical informatics were invited to address the meeting's goals. Invitees were also asked to complete a survey to assess important considerations needed to develop a genomic-based clinical informatics research strategy. Outcomes from the meeting included identifying short-term research needs, such as designing and implementing standards-based interfaces between laboratory information systems and electronic health records, as well as long-term projects, such as identifying and addressing barriers related to the establishment and implementation of genomic data exchange systems that, in turn, the research community could help address. Discussions centered on identifying gaps and barriers that impede the use of GCIT in genomic medicine. Emergent themes from the meeting included developing an implementation science framework, defining a value proposition for all stakeholders, fostering engagement with patients and partners to develop applications under patient control, promoting the use of relevant clinical workflows in research, and lowering related barriers to regulatory processes. Another key theme was recognizing pervasive biases in data and information systems, algorithms, access, value, and knowledge repositories and identifying ways to resolve them.","Wiley, Ken; Findley, Laura;

All of Us,34920126,Membership inference attacks against synthetic health data.,"Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising method to protect patient privacy while sharing individual-level health data. Intuitively, sharing synthetic data should reduce disclosure risks because no explicit linkage is retained between the synthetic records and the real data upon which it is based. However, the risks associated with synthetic data are still evolving, and what seems protected today may not be tomorrow. In this paper, we show that membership inference attacks, whereby an adversary infers if the data from certain target individuals (known to the adversary a priori) were relied upon by the synthetic data generation process, can be substantially enhanced through state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, which calls into question the protective nature of existing synthetic data generators. Specifically, we formulate the membership inference problem from the perspective of the data holder, who aims to perform a disclosure risk assessment prior to sharing any health data. To support such an assessment, we introduce a framework for effective membership inference against synthetic health data without specific assumptions about the generative model or a well-defined data structure, leveraging the principles of contrastive representation learning. To illustrate the potential for such an attack, we conducted experiments against synthesis approaches using two datasets derived from several health data resources (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the All of Us Research Program) to determine the upper bound of risk brought by an adversary who invokes an optimal strategy. The results indicate that partially synthetic data are vulnerable to membership inference at a very high rate. By contrast, fully synthetic data are only marginally susceptible and, in most cases, could be deemed sufficiently protected from membership inference.","Zhang, Ziqi; Yan, Chao; Malin, Bradley A",Journal of biomedical informatics,2022,Confidentiality; Disclosure; Genomics; Humans; Machine Learning; Population Health,Contrastive representation learning; Electronic health record; Membership inference; Synthetic data,"Vanderbilt University, 2525 West End Avenue, Nashville, TN 37240, United States.

Using electronic health records, we assessed the burden of SH and FH in Olmsted County, Minnesota, US, between 2004 and 2015. We defined SH as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level ≥190 mg/dl without secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia and FH as a Dutch Lipid Clinic Network score ≥6. Controls were age- and sex-matched individuals with LDL-C level <190 mg/dl. The age- and sex-adjusted point and period prevalence (age-recursive method) of SH was 4.44% and 8.95%, respectively; 1 in 21 had FH (∼1:233 adults), and 46.2% had a recorded diagnosis. Guideline recommended targets (LDL-C <100 mg/dl and <70 mg/dl in the primary and secondary prevention settings, respectively) were achieved in 33.1% and 21.2% of SH cases, with less women overall achieving the target than men (18.6% vs. 23.7%, p=0.022). After adjustment for conventional risk factors, the hazard ratio for incident coronary heart disease (CHD) in those with SH was 1.21 (1.05-1.39; p=0.010), in those with SH and a family history of CHD was 2.16 (1.57-2.96; p<0.001) and in those with FH was 4.61 (2.66-7.97; p<0.001). The association of SH with CHD was modified by age (p-interaction = 0.015), such that the risk was greater at younger ages. SH was prevalent and an independent risk factor for incident CHD. Awareness and control were low, highlighting a treatment gap (more prominent in women) that needs to be addressed.","Saadatagah, Seyedmohammad; Alhalabi, Lubna; Farwati, Medhat; Zordok, Magdi; Bhat, Ashwini; Smith, Carin Y; Wood-Wentz, Christina M; Bailey, Kent R; Kullo, Iftikhar J",American journal of preventive cardiology,2022,,"ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CHD, coronary heart disease; CVD, cerebrovascular disease; DLCN, dutch lipid clinic network; Epidemiology; FH, familial hypercholesterolemia; Familial hypercholesterolemia; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LLT, lipid lowering therapy; PAD, peripheral artery disease; SH, severe hypercholesterolemia; Severe hypercholesterolemia; Statin","Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Division of Clinical Trials and Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Division of Clinical Trials and Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Division of Clinical Trials and Biostatistics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Gonda Vascular Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.",10.1016/j.ajpc.2022.100393

All of Us,25345513,Effect of electromagnetic radiations on neurodegenerative diseases- technological revolution as a curse in disguise.,"In the present developed world, all of us are flooded with electromagnetic radiations (EMR) emanating from generation and transmission of electricity, domestic appliances and industrial equipments, to telecommunications and broadcasting. We have been exposed to EMR for last many decades; however their recent steady increase from artificial sources has been reported as millions of antennas and satellites irradiate the global population round the clock, year round. Needless to say, these are so integral to modern life that interaction with them on a daily basis is seemingly inevitable; hence, the EMR exposure load has increased to a point where their health effects are becoming a major concern. Delicate and sensitive electrical system of human body is affected by consistent penetration of electromagnetic frequencies causing DNA breakages and chromosomal aberrations. Technological innovations came with Pandora's Box of hazardous consequences including neurodegenerative disorders, hearing disabilities, diabetes, congenital abnormalities, infertility, cardiovascular diseases and cancer to name few, all on a sharp rise. Electromagnetic non-ionizing radiations pose considerable health threat with prolonged exposure. Mobile phones are usually held near to the brain and manifest progressive structural or functional alterations in neurons leading to neurodegenerative diseases and neuronal death. This has provoked awareness among both the general public and scientific community and international bodies acknowledge that further systematic research is needed. The aim of the present review was to have an insight in whether and how cumulative electro-magnetic field exposure is a risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders.","Hasan, Gulam M; Sheikh, Ishfaq A; Karim, Sajjad; Haque, Absarul; Kamal, Mohammad A; Chaudhary, Adeel G; Azhar, Essam; Mirza, Zeenat",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2014,Brain; Electromagnetic Radiation; Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Risk Factors,,"King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, P.O.

All of Us,40156587,Daily Heart Rate per Step: A Wearables Metric Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in a Cross-Sectional Study of the ,"Simple biometrics such as peak heart rate and exercise duration remain core predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Commercial wearable devices track physical and cardiac electrical activity. Detailed, longitudinal data collection from wearables presents a valuable opportunity to identify new factors associated with CVD. This cross-sectional study analyzed 6947 participants in the Fitbit Bring-Your-Own-Device Project, a subset of the All of Us Research Program. The primary exposure daily heart rate per step (DHRPS) was defined as the average daily heart rate divided by steps per day. Our analysis correlated DHRPS with established CVD factors (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart failure, coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction) as primary outcomes. We also performed a DHRPS-based phenome-wide association study on the spectrum of human disease traits for all 1789 disease codes across 17 disease categories. Secondary outcomes included maximum metabolic equivalents achieved on cardiovascular treadmill exercise stress testing.

All of Us,16061920,Electronic health records: just around the corner? Or over the cliff?,"We recently implemented a full-featured electronic health record in our independent, 4-internist, community-based practice of general internal medicine. We encountered various challenges, some unexpected, in moving from paper to computer. This article describes the effects that use of electronic health records has had on our finances, work flow, and office environment. Its financial impact is not clearly positive; work flows were substantially disrupted; and the quality of the office environment initially deteriorated greatly for staff, physicians, and patients. That said, none of us would go back to paper health records, and all of us find that the technology helps us to better meet patient expectations, expedites many tedious work processes (such as prescription writing and creation of chart notes), and creates new ways in which we can improve the health of our patients. Five broad issues must be addressed to promote successful implementation of electronic health records in a small office: financing; interoperability, standardization, and connectivity of clinical information systems; help with redesign of work flow; technical support and training; and help with change management. We hope that sharing our experience can better prepare others who plan to implement electronic health records and inform policymakers on the strategies needed for success in the small practice environment.","Baron, Richard J; Fabens, Elizabeth L; Schiffman, Melissa; Wolf, Erica",Annals of internal medicine,2005,"Computers; Consumer Behavior; Health Personnel; Humans; Internal Medicine; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Office Management; United States; Workload",,"Greenhouse Internists, P.C., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19119, USA. rbaron@greenhouseinternists.com",10.7326/0003-4819-143-3-200508020-00008
All of Us,37561459,Alcohol Consumption Among Adults With a Cancer Diagnosis in the All of Us Research Program.,"Alcohol consumption is associated with adverse oncologic and treatment outcomes among individuals with a diagnosis of cancer. As a key modifiable behavioral factor, alcohol consumption patterns among cancer survivors, especially during treatment, remain underexplored in the United States. To comprehensively characterize alcohol consumption patterns among US cancer survivors. This cross-sectional study used data from May 6, 2018, to January 1, 2022, from the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program, a diverse US cohort with electronic health record (EHR) linkage, and included 15 199 participants who reported a cancer diagnosis and 1839 patients among a subset with EHR data who underwent treatment within the past year of the baseline survey. Data analysis was performed from October 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023. Prevalence of current drinking and of risky drinking behaviors, including exceeding moderate drinking (>2 drinks on a typical drinking day), binge drinking (≥6 drinks on 1 occasion), and hazardous drinking (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption [AUDIT-C] score ≥3 for women or ≥4 for men). This study included 15 199 adults (mean [SD] age at baseline, 63.1 [13.0] years; 9508 women [62.6%]) with a cancer diagnosis. Overall, 11 815 cancer survivors (77.7%) were current drinkers. Among current drinkers, 1541 (13.0%) exceeded moderate drinking, 2812 (23.8%) reported binge drinking, and 4527 (38.3%) engaged in hazardous drinking. After multivariable adjustment, survivors who were younger than 65 years, men, or of Hispanic ethnicity or who received a diagnosis before 18 years of age or ever smoked were more likely to exceed moderate drinking (aged <50 years: odds ratio [OR], 2.90 [95% CI, 2.41-3.48]; aged 50-64 years: OR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.58-2.15]; men: OR, 2.38 [95% CI, 2.09-2.72]; Hispanic ethnicity: OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.04-1.64]; aged <18 years at diagnosis: OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.04-2.24]; former smokers: OR, 2.46 [95% CI, 2.16-2.79]; current smokers: OR, 4.14 [95% CI, 3.40-5.04]) or binge drink (aged <50 years: OR, 4.46 [95% CI, 3.85-5.15]; aged 50-64 years: OR, 2.15 [95% CI, 1.90-2.43]; men: OR, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.89-2.34]; Hispanic ethnicity: OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.09-1.58]; aged <18 years at diagnosis: OR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.24-2.35]; former smokers: OR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.53-1.87]; current smokers: OR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.91-2.71]). Survivors with cancer diagnosed before 18 years of age or who ever smoked were more likely to be hazardous drinkers (aged <18 years at diagnosis: OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.11-2.08]; former smokers: OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.68-1.99]; current smokers: OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.79-2.53]). Of 1839 survivors receiving treatment as captured in the EHR, 1405 (76.4%) were current drinkers, and among these, 170 (12.1%) exceeded moderate drinking, 329 (23.4%) reported binge drinking, and 540 (38.4%) engaged in hazardous drinking, with similar prevalence across different types of cancer treatment. This cross-sectional study of a diverse US cohort suggests that alcohol consumption and risky drinking behaviors were common among cancer survivors, even among individuals receiving treatment. Given the adverse treatment and oncologic outcomes associated with alcohol consumption, additional research and implementation studies are critical in addressing this emerging concern among cancer survivors.","Shi, Mengyao; Luo, Chongliang; Oduyale, Oluseye K; Zong, Xiaoyu; LoConte, Noelle K; Cao, Yin",JAMA network open,2023,Male; Humans; Adult; Female; United States; Adolescent; Alcoholism; Binge Drinking; Cross-Sectional Studies; Population Health; Alcohol Drinking; Ethanol; Neoplasms,,"Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.; Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.; Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.; Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.; Division of Hematology, Medical Oncology and Palliative Care, Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison.; University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, Madison.; Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.; Alvin J.

The standard approach of biomedical research, with researchers pursuing advances in knowledge in the laboratory and, separately, clinicians translating research findings into the clinic as much as decades later, will need to give way to new interdisciplinary models for research in genomic medicine. These models should include scientists and clinicians actively working as teams to study patients and populations recruited in clinical settings and communities to make genomics discoveries-through the combined efforts of data scientists, clinical researchers, epidemiologists, and basic scientists-and to rapidly apply these discoveries in the clinic for the prediction, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. The highly publicized US Precision Medicine Initiative, also known as All of Us, is a large-scale program funded by the US National Institutes of Health that will energize these efforts, but several ongoing studies such as the UK Biobank Initiative; the Million Veteran Program; the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network; the Kaiser Permanente Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health; and the DiscovEHR collaboration are already providing exemplary models of this kind of interdisciplinary work.

This retrospective cohort study included multiancestry US adults aged ≥18 years with sequencing data from the All of Us Research Program. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in cardiomyopathy genes were identified using the ClinVar database. The primary outcome was heart failure. Secondary outcomes included cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia. Outcomes were identified from electronic health records. Interval-censored Cox models, taking age on the timescale, were used to assess the risk of outcomes in pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant carriers with noncarriers as the reference group. Among 167 435 individuals (median age, 55.2 [39.5-66.3] years; 61.7% female; 40.7% non-European ancestry) included, the prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic cardiomyopathy variant carriers was 0.7% in the overall population and 0.8%, 0.8%, 0.5%, and 1.2% among European, African, East Asian, and South Asian ancestry individuals, respectively. Over their lifetime, there were 12 867 heart failure events (205 in carriers and 12 662 in noncarriers), with an incidence rate of 3.05 (95% CI, 2.66-3.49) per 1000 person-years in carriers and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.35-1.40) in noncarriers (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.30 [95% CI, 2.04-2.60]). Cardiomyopathy occurred in 5164 (161 in carriers and 5003 in noncarriers), with an incidence rate of 2.38 (95% CI, 2.04-2.78) per 1000 person-years among carriers and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.53-0.56) in noncarriers (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.31 [95% CI, 3.73-4.97]). There were 19 405 arrhythmia events (263 in carriers and 19 142 in noncarriers), with an incidence rate of 3.93 (95% CI, 3.48-4.44) per 1000 person-years among carriers and 2.09 (95% CI, 2.06-2.12) in noncarriers (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.12 [95% CI, 1.78-2.53]).

All of Us,39587643,Exploring the role of PARP1 inhibition in enhancing antibody-drug conjugate therapy for acute leukemias: insights from DNA damage response pathway interactions.,"The introduction of antibody-drug conjugates represents a significant advancement in targeted therapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Our study aims to investigate the role of the DNA damage response pathway and the impact of PARP1 inhibition, utilizing talazoparib, on the response of AML and ALL cells to Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) and Inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO), respectively. AML and ALL cells were treated with GO, INO and γ-calicheamicin in order to induce severe DNA damage and activate the G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The efficacy of PARP1 inhibitors and, in particular, talazoparib in enhancing INO or GO against ALL or AML cells was assessed through measurements of cell viability, cell death, cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, accumulation of mitotic DNA damage and inhibition of clonogenic capacity. We observed that both ALL and AML cell lines activate the G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint in response to γ-calicheamicin-induced DNA damage, highlighting a shared cellular response mechanism. Talazoparib significantly enhanced the efficacy of INO against ALL cell lines, resulting in reduced cell viability, increased cell death, G2/M cell-cycle checkpoint override, accumulation of mitotic DNA damage and inhibition of clonogenic capacity. Strong synergism was observed in primary ALL cells treated with the combination. In contrast, AML cells exhibited a heterogeneous response to talazoparib in combination with GO. Our findings suggest a potential link between the differential responses of ALL and AML cells to the drug combinations and the ability of talazoparibto override G2/M cell-cycle arrest induced by antibody-drug conjugates. PARP1 emerges as a key player in the response of ALL cells to INO and represents a promising target for therapeutic intervention in this leukemia setting. Our study sheds light on the intricate interplay between the DNA damage response pathway, PARP1 inhibition, and response of γ-calicheamicin-induced DNA damages in AML and ALL. These findings underscore the importance of targeted therapeutic strategies and pave the way for future research aimed at optimizing leukemia treatment approaches.","Ghelli Luserna di Rorà, Andrea; Jandoubi, Mouna; Padella, Antonella; Ferrari, Anna; Marranci, Andrea; Mazzotti, Cristina; Olimpico, Francesco; Ghetti, Martina; Ledda, Lorenzo; Bochicchio, Maria Teresa; Paganelli, Matteo; Zanoni, Michele; Cafaro, Alessandro; Servili, Chiara; Galimberti, Sara; Gottardi, Michele; Rondoni, Michela; Endri, Mauro; Onofrillo, Daniela; Audisio, Ernesta; Marconi, Giovanni; Simonetti, Giorgia; Martinelli, Giovanni",Journal of translational medicine,2024,"Humans; DNA Damage; Cell Line, Tumor; Immunoconjugates; Phthalazines; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1; Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors; DNA Repair; Cell Survival; Gemtuzumab; G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Drug Synergism; Signal Transduction",Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); Acute myeloid leukemia (AML); Antibody–drug conjugates; DNA damage response pathway; PARP1 inhibition,"Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Via Piero Maroncelli, 40, 47014, Meldola, FC, Italy.; Fondazione Pisana per la Scienza ONLUS, San Giuliano Terme, Italy.; Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Via Piero Maroncelli, 40, 47014, Meldola, FC, Italy.; Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Via Piero Maroncelli, 40, 47014, Meldola, FC, Italy.; Wellmicro SPA, Bologna, Italy.; Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Via Piero Maroncelli, 40, 47014, Meldola, FC, Italy. anna.ferrari@irst.emr.it.; Fondazione Pisana per la Scienza ONLUS, San Giuliano Terme, Italy.; Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Via Piero Maroncelli, 40, 47014, Meldola, FC, Italy.; Fondazione Pisana per la Scienza ONLUS, San Giuliano Terme, Italy.; Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Via Piero Maroncelli, 40, 47014, Meldola, FC, Italy.; Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Via Piero Maroncelli, 40, 47014, Meldola, FC, Italy.; Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Via Piero Maroncelli, 40, 47014, Meldola, FC, Italy.; Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Via Piero Maroncelli, 40, 47014, Meldola, FC, Italy.; Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Via Piero Maroncelli, 40, 47014, Meldola, FC, Italy.; Pharmacy, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Via Piero Maroncelli, 40, 47014, Meldola, FC, Italy.; Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Via Piero Maroncelli, 40, 47014, Meldola, FC, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Pisa, 56126, Pisa, Italy.; Onco Hematology, Department of Oncology, Veneto Institute of Oncology, Istituto Oncologico Veneto-Istituto di Ricerca e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IOV-IRCCS), Castelfranco Veneto, Italy.; Hematology Unit & Romagna Transplant Network, Ravenna Hospital, Ravenna, Italy.; Azienda ULSS 2 Marca Trevigiana Ospedale Ca' Foncello, Treviso, Italy.; UOC di Ematologia, Dipartimento di Oncologia Ematologia, Ospedale Santo Spirito, Pescara, Italy.; Hematology Unit, Presidio Ospedaliero Molinette, A.O.U.

All of Us,38946982,Stroke Risk Reduction in Migraine Patients Using Propranolol: Evidence from Two Large-Scale Real-World Data Analyses.,"Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is commonly used for migraine prevention, but its impact on stroke risk among migraine patients remains controversial. Using two large electronic health records-based datasets, we examined stroke risk differences between migraine patients with- and without- documented use of propranolol. This retrospective case-control study utilized EHR data from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and the All of Us Research Program. Migraine patients were first identified based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) criteria using diagnosis codes. Among these patients, cases were defined as those with a primary diagnosis of stroke following the first diagnosis of migraine, while controls had no stroke after their first migraine diagnosis. Logistic regression models, adjusted for potential factors associated with stroke risk, assessed the association between propranolol use and stroke risk, stratified by sex and migraine subtype. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for stroke risk at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years from baseline. In the VUMC database, 378 cases and 15,209 controls were identified, while the All of Us database included 267 cases and 6,579 controls. Propranolol significantly reduced stroke risk in female migraine patients (VUMC: OR=0.52, p=0.006; All of Us: OR=0.39, p=0.007), but not in males. The effect was more pronounced for ischemic stroke and in females with migraines without aura (MO) (VUMC: OR=0.60, p=0.014; All of Us: OR=0.28, p=0.006). The Cox model showed lower stroke rates in propranolol-treated female migraine patients at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years (VUMC: HR=0.06-0.55, p=0.0018-0.085; All of Us: HR=0.23, p=0.045 at 10 years). Propranolol is associated with a significant reduction in stroke risk, particularly ischemic stroke, among female migraine without aura patients. These findings suggest that propranolol may benefit stroke prevention in high-risk populations.","Jeong, Eugene; Mogos, Mulubrhan F; Chen, You",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024,,Adrenergic beta-antagonists; Electronic health records; Migraine; Propranolol; Stroke,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; School of Nursing, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Computer Science, School of Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.",10.1101/2024.06.11.24308801
All of Us,40397457,Polygenic Prediction of Peripheral Artery Disease and Major Adverse Limb Events.,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a heritable atherosclerotic condition associated with functional decline and high risk for limb loss. With growing knowledge of the genetic basis for PAD and related risk factors, there is potential opportunity to identify individuals at high risk using polygenic risk scores (PRSs). To develop a novel integrated, multiancestry polygenic score for PAD (PRS-PAD) and evaluate its risk estimation for PAD and major adverse limb events in 3 populations. This longitudinal cohort study was conducted among individuals with genotyping and electronic health record data in the UK Biobank (2006-2021), All of Us (AoU, 2018-2022), and the Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB, 2010-2023). Data were analyzed from July 2023 to February 2025. PRS-PAD, previously published PAD polygenic scores, and clinical risk factors. The primary outcomes were PAD and major adverse limb events, defined as a surrogate of major amputation and acute limb ischemia. The study populations included 400 533 individuals from the UK Biobank (median [IQR] age, 58.2 [45.0-71.4] years; 216 215 female participants [53.9%]), 218 500 from AoU (median [IQR] age, 53.6 [37.7-65.0] years; 132 647 female participants [60.7%]), and 32 982 from MGBB (median [IQR] age, 56.0 [32.0-80.0] years; 18 277 female participants [55.4%]). In the UK Biobank validation cohort, PRS-PAD was associated with an odds ratio [OR] per SD increase of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.60-1.68; P < .001). After adjusting for clinical risk factors, the OR for the top 20% of PRS-PAD was 1.68 (95% CI, 1.62-1.74; P < .001) compared to the remainder of the population. Among PAD cases without a history of diabetes, smoking, or chronic kidney disease (n = 3645), 1097 individuals (30.1%) had a high PRS-PAD (top 20%). In incident disease analysis, PRS-PAD improved discrimination (C statistic, 0.761), which was nearly equivalent to the performances of diabetes (C statistic, 0.760) and smoking (C statistic, 0.765). Among individuals with prevalent PAD, high PRS-PAD was associated with an increased risk of incident major adverse limb events in the UK Biobank (hazard ratio [HR], 1.75; 95% CI, 1.18-2.57; P = .005), MGBB (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.06-2.30; P = .02), and AoU (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.06-2.33; P = .03). This cohort study develops a new PRS that stratifies risk of PAD and adverse limb outcomes. Incorporating polygenic risk into PAD care warrants further investigation to guide screening and tailor management to prevent major adverse limb events.","Flores, Alyssa M; Ruan, Yunfeng; Misra, Anika; Cho, So Mi Jemma; Selvaraj, Margaret S; Bellomo, Tiffany R; Nakao, Tetsushi; Rosenfield, Kenneth; Eagleton, Matthew; Hornsby, Whitney; Patel, Aniruddh P; Natarajan, Pradeep",JAMA cardiology,2025,,,"Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Associate Editor, JAMA Cardiology.",10.1001/jamacardio.2025.1182
All of Us,38795312,Impact of polygenic risk score for triglyceride trajectory and diabetic complications in subjects with type 2 diabetes based on large electronic medical record data from Taiwan: a case control study.,"The prevalence of diabetic dyslipidemia has gradually increased worldwide and individuals with hypertriglyceridemia often have a high polygenic burden of triglyceride (TG)-increasing variants. However, the contribution of genetic variants to dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the genetic characteristics of longitudinal changes in TG levels among patients with T2D and summarize the genetic effects of polygenic risk score (PRS) on TG trajectory and risk of diabetic complications. We conducted a case-control study. A total of 11,312 patients with T2D with longitudinal TG and genetic data were identified from a large hospital database in Taiwan. We then performed a genome-wide association study and calculated the relative PRS. In total, 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to TG trajectory were identified and yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.712 for high TG trajectory risk among Taiwanese patients with T2D. A cumulative genetic effect was observed for high TG trajectory, even when considering the adherence of a lipid-lowering agent in stratified analysis. An increased PRS increases high TG trajectory risk in a logistic regression model (odds ratio = 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.31-1.83 in the validation cohort). The TG-specific PRS was associated with the risk of diabetic microvascular complications, including diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy (with hazard ratios of 1.11 [95% CI = 1.01-1.21, P = 0.027] and 1.05 [95% CI = 1.01-1.1, P = 0.018], respectively). This study may contribute to the identification of patients with T2D who are at risk of abnormal TG levels and diabetic microvascular complications using polygenic information.","Liao, W-L; Huang, Y-C; Chang, Y-W; Cheng, C-F; Liu, T-Y; Lu, H-F; Chen, H-L; Tsai, F-J",Journal of endocrinological investigation,2024,"Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Male; Female; Case-Control Studies; Taiwan; Middle Aged; Electronic Health Records; Triglycerides; Genome-Wide Association Study; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Multifactorial Inheritance; Aged; Diabetes Complications; Risk Factors; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Hypertriglyceridemia; Genetic Risk Score",Genome-wide association study; Polygenic risk score; Trajectory; Triglyceride; Type 2 diabetes,"Graduate Institute of Integrated Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, 40402, Taiwan.; Center for Personalized Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, 40447, Taiwan.; School of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, 40402, Taiwan.; Genetic Center, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, 40447, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Integrated Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, 40402, Taiwan.; Center for Personalized Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, 40447, Taiwan.; Genetic Center, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, 40447, Taiwan.; Big Data Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, 40447, Taiwan.; Million-Person Precision Medicine Initiative, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, 40447, Taiwan.; Million-Person Precision Medicine Initiative, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, 40447, Taiwan.; Big Data Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, 40447, Taiwan.; School of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, 40402, Taiwan. 000704@tool.caaumed.org.tw.; Genetic Center, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, 40447, Taiwan. 000704@tool.caaumed.org.tw.; Division of Medical Genetics, China Medical University Children's Hospital, Taichung, 40447, Taiwan. 000704@tool.caaumed.org.tw.; Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Asia University, Taichung, 413305, Taiwan. 000704@tool.caaumed.org.tw.",10.1007/s40618-024-02397-0

Aggregation of medical record data from multiple sites creates new challenges prompting the need to identify and correct errant values. We sought to characterize and correct issues with height and weight measurement values within the All of Us (AoU) Research Program. Using the AoU Researcher Workbench, we assessed site-level measurement value distributions to infer unit types. We also used plausibility checks with exceptions for conditions with possible outlier values, eg obesity, and assessed for excess deviation within individual participant's records. 15.8% of height and 22.4% of weight values had missing unit type information. We identified several measurement unit related issues: the use of different units of measure within and between sites, missing units, and incorrect labeling of units. Failure to account for these in patient data repositories may lead to erroneous study results and conclusions. Discrepancies in height and weight measurement data may arise from missing or mislabeled units. Using site- and participant-level analyses while accounting for outlier value-associated clinical conditions, we can infer measurement units and apply corrections. These methods are adaptable and expandable within AoU and other data repositories.","Khan, Mirza S; Carroll, Robert J",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2022,Body Height; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Humans; Medical Records; Obesity; Population Health,biomedical research; body height; body mass index; body weight; electronic health records/statistics and numerical data,"Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), Tennessee Valley Health System Veterans Administration Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Division of General Internal Medicine and Public Health, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.",10.1093/jamia/ocab251

We estimated prevalence, overlap, and sociodemographic correlates for psychiatric disorders as reported in electronic health records for All of Us release 5 (N = 331 380). Social and demographic covariates. Psychiatric disorders derived from International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, codes across 6 broad domains: mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, stress-related disorders, schizophrenia, and personality disorders. The analytic sample (N = 329 038) was 60.7% female (mean [SD] age, 50.9 [16.8] years). The prevalence of disorders ranged from 11.00% (95% CI, 10.68% to 11.32%) for any mood disorder to less than 1% (eg, obsessive-compulsive disorder, 0.18%; 95% CI, -0.16% to 0.52%), with mood disorders being the most common and personality disorders being the least. There was substantial overlap among disorders, with the majority of participants with a disorder (30 113/58 806, approximately 51%) having 2 or more registered diagnoses and tetrachoric correlations ranging from 0.43 to 0.74. Comparisons of prevalence across demographic categories revealed that non-Hispanic White people, individuals with low socioeconomic status, women and individuals assigned female at birth, and sexual minority individuals are at greatest risk for most disorders. Although rates of disorders among the All of Us cohort are lower than in the general population, considerable variation, comorbidity, and disparities exist across social groups.

All of Us,36396674,Investigation of hypertension and type 2 diabetes as risk factors for dementia in the All of Us cohort.,"The World Health Organization recently defined hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as modifiable comorbidities leading to dementia and Alzheimer's disease. In the United States (US), hypertension and T2D are health disparities, with higher prevalence seen for Black and Hispanic minority groups compared to the majority White population. We hypothesized that elevated prevalence of hypertension and T2D risk factors in Black and Hispanic groups may be associated with dementia disparities. We interrogated this hypothesis using a cross-sectional analysis of participant data from the All of Us (AoU) Research Program, a large observational cohort study of US residents. The specific objectives of our study were: (1) to compare the prevalence of dementia, hypertension, and T2D in the AoU cohort to previously reported prevalence values for the US population, (2) to investigate the association of hypertension, T2D, and race/ethnicity with dementia, and (3) to investigate whether race/ethnicity modify the association of hypertension and T2D with dementia. AoU participants were recruited from 2018 to 2019 as part of the initial project cohort (R2019Q4R3). Participants aged 40-80 with electronic health records and demographic data (age, sex, race, and ethnicity) were included for analysis, yielding a final cohort of 125,637 individuals. AoU participants show similar prevalence of hypertension (32.1%) and T2D (13.9%) compared to the US population (32.0% and 10.5%, respectively); however, the prevalence of dementia for AoU participants (0.44%) is an order of magnitude lower than seen for the US population (5%). AoU participants with dementia show a higher prevalence of hypertension (81.6% vs. 31.9%) and T2D (45.9% vs. 11.4%) compared to non-dementia participants. Dominance analysis of a multivariable logistic regression model with dementia as the outcome shows that hypertension, age, and T2D have the strongest associations with dementia. Hispanic was the only race/ethnicity group that showed a significant association with dementia, and the association of sex with dementia was non-significant. The association of T2D with dementia is likely explained by concurrent hypertension, since > 90% of participants with T2D also had hypertension. Black race and Hispanic ethnicity interact with hypertension, but not T2D, to increase the odds of dementia. This study underscores the utility of the AoU participant cohort to study disease prevalence and risk factors. We do notice a lower participation of aged minorities and participants with dementia, revealing an opportunity for targeted engagement. Our results indicate that targeting hypertension should be a priority for risk factor modifications to reduce dementia incidence.","Nagar, Shashwat Deepali; Pemu, Priscilla; Qian, Jun; Boerwinkle, Eric; Cicek, Mine; Clark, Cheryl R; Cohn, Elizabeth; Gebo, Kelly; Loperena, Roxana; Mayo, Kelsey; Mockrin, Stephen; Ohno-Machado, Lucila; Ramirez, Andrea H; Schully, Sheri; Able, Ashley; Green, Ashley; Zuchner, Stephan; Jordan, I King; Meller, Robert",Scientific reports,2022,"Humans; United States; Child, Preschool; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Cross-Sectional Studies; Population Health; Hypertension; Risk Factors; Cohort Studies",,"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA.; Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, USA.; University of Miami, Coral Gables, USA.; All of Us Demonstration Projects Subcommittee, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, USA.; All of Us Demonstration Projects Subcommittee, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, USA.; All of Us Demonstration Projects Subcommittee, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA.; All of Us Demonstration Projects Subcommittee, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, USA.; All of Us Demonstration Projects Subcommittee, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; Hunter College, New York, USA.; All of Us Demonstration Projects Subcommittee, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; All of Us Demonstration Projects Subcommittee, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, USA.; All of Us Demonstration Projects Subcommittee, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, USA.; All of Us Demonstration Projects Subcommittee, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; All of Us Demonstration Projects Subcommittee, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; University of California, San Diego, USA.; All of Us Demonstration Projects Subcommittee, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, USA.; All of Us Demonstration Projects Subcommittee, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, USA.; All of Us Demonstration Projects Subcommittee, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, USA.; All of Us Demonstration Projects Subcommittee, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA.; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, USA.; University of Miami, Coral Gables, USA.; Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA. king.jordan@biology.gatech.edu.; Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, USA. rmeller@msm.edu.; University of Miami, Coral Gables, USA. rmeller@msm.edu.",10.1038/s41598-022-23353-z

Hypertension (HTN) is a major public health concern. The validity of HTN data and definition of hypertension cases in the All of Us (AoU) Research Program for use in rule-based algorithms is unknown. In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we compare HTN prevalence in the AoU Research Program to HTN prevalence in the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We used AoU baseline data from patient (age ≥ 18) measurements (PM), surveys, and electronic health record (EHR) blood pressure measurements. We retrospectively examined the prevalence of HTN in the EHR cohort using Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes and blood pressure medications recorded in the EHR. We defined HTN as the participant having at least 2 HTN diagnosis/billing codes on separate dates in the EHR data AND at least one HTN medication. We calculated an age-standardized HTN prevalence according to the age distribution of the U.S. Census, using 3 groups (18-39, 40-59, and ≥ 60). Among the 185,770 participants enrolled in the AoU Cohort (mean age at enrollment = 51.2 years) available in a Researcher Workbench as of October 2019, EHR data was available for at least one SNOMED code from 112,805 participants, medications for 104,230 participants, and 103,490 participants had both medication and SNOMED data. The total number of persons with SNOMED codes on at least two distinct dates and at least one antihypertensive medication was 33,310 for a crude prevalence of HTN of 32.2%. AoU age-adjusted HTN prevalence was 27.9% using 3 groups compared to 29.6% in NHANES. The AoU cohort is a growing source of diverse longitudinal data to study hypertension nationwide and develop precision rule-based algorithms for use in hypertension treatment and prevention research. The prevalence of hypertension in this cohort is similar to that in prior population-based surveys.","Chandler, Paulette D; Clark, Cheryl R; Zhou, Guohai; Noel, Nyia L; Achilike, Confidence; Mendez, Lizette; Ramirez, Andrea H; Loperena-Cortes, Roxana; Mayo, Kelsey; Cohn, Elizabeth; Ohno-Machado, Lucila; Boerwinkle, Eric; Cicek, Mine; Qian, Jun; Schully, Sheri; Ratsimbazafy, Francis; Mockrin, Stephen; Gebo, Kelly; Dedier, Julien J; Murphy, Shawn N; Smoller, Jordan W; Karlson, Elizabeth W",Scientific reports,2021,Adolescent; Adult; Biomedical Research; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Minority Groups; Prevalence; United States; Young Adult,,"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA. pchandler@bwh.harvard.edu.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.; Boston Medical Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.; Boston Medical Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.; Boston Medical Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Hunter College, New York, NY, USA.; University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.; University of Texas Health Science Center School of Public Health, Houston, TX, USA.; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Life Sciences Division, Leidos, Inc, Frederick, MD, USA.; Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Boston Medical Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.; Research Information Science and Computing, Mass General Brigham, Boston, MA, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.",10.1038/s41598-021-92143-w

All of Us,37418391,Learning important common data elements from shared study data: The All of Us program analysis.,"There are many initiatives attempting to harmonize data collection across human clinical studies using common data elements (CDEs). The increased use of CDEs in large prior studies can guide researchers planning new studies. For that purpose, we analyzed the All of Us (AoU) program, an ongoing US study intending to enroll one million participants and serve as a platform for numerous observational analyses. AoU adopted the OMOP Common Data Model to standardize both research (Case Report Form [CRF]) and real-world (imported from Electronic Health Records [EHRs]) data. AoU standardized specific data elements and values by including CDEs from terminologies such as LOINC and SNOMED CT. For this study, we defined all elements from established terminologies as CDEs and all custom concepts created in the Participant Provided Information (PPI) terminology as unique data elements (UDEs). We found 1 033 research elements, 4 592 element-value combinations and 932 distinct values. Most elements were UDEs (869, 84.1%), while most CDEs were from LOINC (103 elements, 10.0%) or SNOMED CT (60, 5.8%). Of the LOINC CDEs, 87 (53.1% of 164 CDEs) originated from previous data collection initiatives, such as PhenX (17 CDEs) and PROMIS (15 CDEs). On a CRF level, The Basics (12 of 21 elements, 57.1%) and Lifestyle (10 of 14, 71.4%) were the only CRFs with multiple CDEs. On a value level, 61.7% of distinct values are from an established terminology. AoU demonstrates the use of the OMOP model for integrating research and routine healthcare data (64 elements in both contexts), which allows for monitoring lifestyle and health changes outside the research setting. The increased inclusion of CDEs in large studies (like AoU) is important in facilitating the use of existing tools and improving the ease of understanding and analyzing the data collected, which is more challenging when using study specific formats.","Mayer, Craig S; Huser, Vojtech",PloS one,2023,Humans; Common Data Elements; Population Health; Data Collection; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; Delivery of Health Care,,"Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communication, National Library of Medicine, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.; Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communication, National Library of Medicine, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.",10.1371/journal.pone.0283601
All of Us,36549934,Sociodemographic characteristics differ across routine adult vaccine cohorts: An All of Us descriptive study.,"The National Institutes of Health All of Us (AoU) Research Program is currently building a database of 1million+ adult subjects. With it, we describe the characteristics of those with documented vaccinations. To describe the sociodemographic, health status, and lifestyle factors associated with vaccinations. This is a retrospective study involving data from the AoU program (R2020Q4R2, N = 315,297). Five vaccine cohorts [influenza, hepatitis B (HBV), pneumococcal <65 years old, pneumococcal ≥65 years old, and human papillomavirus (HPV)] were generated based on vaccination history. The influenza cohort comprised participants with documented influenza vaccinations in electronic health records (EHRs) from September 2017 to May 2018. Other vaccine cohorts comprised participants with ≥1 lifetime record(s) of vaccination documented in the EHR by December 2018. The vaccine cohorts were compared to the overall AoU cohort. Descriptive statistics were generated using EHR- and survey-based sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle information. The SAMBA (0.9.0) R package was utilized to adjust for EHR selection and outcome misclassification biases to infer sources of disparity for pneumococcal vaccinations in older adults. Cohort counts were as follows: influenza (n = 15,346), HBV (n = 6323), pneumococcal <65 (n = 15,217), pneumococcal ≥65 (n = 15,100), and HPV (n = 2125). All vaccine cohorts had higher proportions of White and non-Hispanic/Latino participants compared to the overall AoU cohort. The largest differences were found in pneumococcal age ≥65, with 80.2% White participants compared to 52.9% in the overall study population. Multivariable analysis revealed that race/ethnic disparities in pneumococcal vaccination among older adults were explained by biological sex, income, health insurance, and education-related variables. Racial, ethnic, education, and income characteristics differ across the vaccine cohorts among AoU participants. These findings inform future utilization of large health databases in vaccine epidemiology research and emphasize the need for more targeted interventions that address differences in vaccine uptake.","Ng, Ding Quan; Jia, Stanley; Wisseh, Cheryl; Cadiz, Christine; Nguyen, Megan; Lee, Joyce; McBane, Sarah; Nguyen, Lee; Chan, Alexandre; Hurley-Kim, Keri",Journal of the American Pharmacists Association : JAPhA,2023,"Humans; Aged; Influenza, Human; Retrospective Studies; Papillomavirus Infections; Population Health; Vaccination; Influenza Vaccines; Pneumococcal Vaccines",,,10.1016/j.japh.2022.11.005

Given their dense phenotype data, biobanks can also facilitate replication studies on a phenome-wide scale. Here, we introduce the phenotype-genotype reference map (PGRM), a set of 5,879 genetic associations from 523 GWAS publications that can be used for high-throughput replication experiments. PGRM phenotypes are standardized as phecodes, ensuring interoperability between biobanks. We applied the PGRM to five ancestry-specific cohorts from four independent biobanks and found evidence of robust replications across a wide array of phenotypes. We show how the PGRM can be used to detect data corruption and to empirically assess parameters for phenome-wide studies. Finally, we use the PGRM to explore factors associated with replicability of GWAS results.","Bastarache, Lisa; Delozier, Sarah; Pandit, Anita; He, Jing; Lewis, Adam; Annis, Aubrey C; LeFaive, Jonathon; Denny, Joshua C; Carroll, Robert J; Altman, Russ B; Hughey, Jacob J; Zawistowski, Matthew; Peterson, Josh F",American journal of human genetics,2023,Humans; Biological Specimen Banks; Data Science; Phenomics; Phenotype; Genotype,GWAS; PheWAS; biobanks; data quality; electronic health records; phecodes; phenotyping; replication,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.

All of Us,40167483,Prediction of Breast Cancer Remission.,"This study aims to use electronic health records (EHR) and social determinants of health (SDOH) data to predict breast cancer remission. The emphasis is placed on utilizing easily accessible information to improve predictive models, facilitate the early detection of high-risk patients, and facilitate targeted interventions and personalized care strategies. This study identifies individuals who are unlikely to respond to standard treatment of breast cancer. The study identified 1621 patients with breast cancer by selecting patients who received tamoxifen in the All of Us Research Database. The dependent variable, remission, was defined using tamoxifen exposure as a proxy. Data preprocessing involved creating dummy variables for diseases, demographic, and socioeconomic factors and handling missing values to maintain data integrity. For the feature selection phase, we utilized the strong rule for feature elimination and then logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression with 5-fold cross-validation to reduce the number of predictors by retaining only those with coefficients with an absolute value greater than 0.01. We then trained machine learning models using logistic regression, random forest, naïve Bayes, and extreme gradient boost using area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) metric to score model performance. This created race-neutral model performance. Finally, we analyzed model performance for race and ethnicity test populations including Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Other Race or Ethnicity. These generated race-specific model performance. The model achieved an AUROC range between 0.68 and 0.75, with logistic regression and random forest trained on data without interaction terms demonstrating the best performance. Feature selection identified significant factors such as melanocytic nevus and bone disorders, highlighting the importance of these factors in predictive accuracy. Race-specific model performance was lower than race-neutral model performance for Non-Hispanic Blacks, and Other Race and Ethnicity Groups. In conclusion, our research demonstrates the feasibility of predicting breast cancer non-remission using EHR and SDOH data, achieving acceptable performance without complex predictors. Addressing the data quality limitations and refining remission indicators can further improve the models' utility for early treatment decisions, fostering improved patient outcomes and support throughout the cancer journey.","Cardenas, Vladimir; Li, Yalin; Shrestha, Samika; Xue, Hong",Quality management in health care,2025,"Humans; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Middle Aged; Electronic Health Records; Tamoxifen; Remission Induction; Machine Learning; Social Determinants of Health; Aged; Adult; United States; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Logistic Models; Socioeconomic Factors",breast cancer; electronic health records; non-remission; predictive modeling; social determinants of health,"Author Affiliations: Health and Administration Policy Department, College of Public Health, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia.",10.1097/QMH.0000000000000513

Retrospective cohort study from June 2014 through June 2021. Adults 18 years of age or older with a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, or age-related macular degeneration. For All of Us, research participants completed online survey forms as part of a nationwide prospective cohort study. In local EHRs, patients were selected based on diagnosis codes. Social determinants of health data coverage, characterized by the proportion of each disease cohort with available data regarding demographics and socioeconomic factors. In All of Us, we identified 23 806 unique adult patients, of whom 2246 had a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, 13 448 had a diagnosis of glaucoma, 6634 had a diagnosis of cataracts, and 1478 had a diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration. Survey completion rates were high (99.5%-100%) across all cohorts for demographic information, overall health, income, education, and lifestyle. However, health care access (12.7%-29.4%), housing (0.7%-1.1%), social isolation (0.2%-0.3%), and food security (0-0.1%) showed significantly lower response rates. In local EHRs, we identified 80 548 adult patients, of whom 6616 had a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, 26 793 had a diagnosis of glaucoma, 40 427 had a diagnosis of cataracts, and 6712 had a diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration. High data coverage was found across all cohorts for variables related to tobacco use (82.84%-89.07%), alcohol use (77.45%-83.66%), and intravenous drug use (84.76%-93.14%). However, low data coverage (< 50% completion) was found for all other variables, including education, finances, social isolation, stress, physical activity, food insecurity, and transportation. We used chi-square testing to assess whether the data coverage varied across different disease cohorts and found that all fields varied significantly (P < 0.001). The limited and highly variable data coverage in both local EHRs and All of Us highlights the need for researchers and providers to develop SDoH data collection strategies and to assemble complete datasets.","Lee, Terrence C; Saseendrakumar, Bharanidharan Radha; Nayak, Mahasweta; Chan, Alison X; McDermott, John J; Shahrvini, Bita; Ye, Gordon Y; Sitapati, Amy M; Nebeker, Camille; Baxter, Sally L",Ophthalmology science,2022,,Biomedical informatics; Clinical informatics; Data availability; Electronic health record; Social determinants of health,"Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.",10.1016/j.xops.2022.100151
All of Us,37642512,Identification and Prediction of Clinical Phenotypes in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19: Machine Learning From Medical Records.,"There is significant heterogeneity in disease progression among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is attributed to a complex interplay between virus and host immune response that in some patients unpredictably and rapidly leads to ""hyperinflammation"" associated with increased risk of mortality. The early identification of patients at risk of progression to hyperinflammation may help inform timely therapeutic decisions and lead to improved outcomes. The primary objective of this study was to use machine learning to reproducibly identify specific risk-stratifying clinical phenotypes across hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and compare treatment response characteristics and outcomes. A secondary objective was to derive a predictive phenotype classification model using routinely available early encounter data that may be useful in informing optimal COVID-19 bedside clinical management. This was a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data of adult patients (N=4379) who were admitted to a Johns Hopkins Health System hospital for COVID-19 treatment from 2020 to 2021. Phenotypes were identified by clustering 38 routine clinical observations recorded during inpatient care. To examine the reproducibility and validity of the derived phenotypes, patient data were randomly divided into 2 cohorts, and clustering analysis was performed independently for each cohort. A predictive phenotype classifier using the gradient-boosting machine method was derived using routine clinical observations recorded during the first 6 hours following admission. A total of 2 phenotypes (designated as phenotype 1 and phenotype 2) were identified in patients admitted for COVID-19 in both the training and validation cohorts with similar distributions of features, correlations with biomarkers, treatments, comorbidities, and outcomes. In both the training and validation cohorts, phenotype-2 patients were older; had elevated markers of inflammation; and were at an increased risk of requiring intensive care unit-level care, developing sepsis, and mortality compared with phenotype-1 patients. The gradient-boosting machine phenotype prediction model yielded an area under the curve of 0.89 and a positive predictive value of 0.83. Using machine learning clustering, we identified and internally validated 2 clinical COVID-19 phenotypes with distinct treatment or response characteristics consistent with similar 2-phenotype models derived from other hospitalized populations with COVID-19, supporting the reliability and generalizability of these findings. COVID-19 phenotypes can be accurately identified using machine learning models based on readily available early encounter clinical data. A phenotype prediction model based on early encounter data may be clinically useful for timely bedside risk stratification and treatment personalization.","Velez, Tom; Wang, Tony; Garibaldi, Brian; Singman, Eric; Koutroulis, Ioannis",JMIR formative research,2023,,COVID; big data; biomarkers; clinical phenotypes; critical care; early warning; electronic medical record; immune response; infection; machine learning; mortality; pathogenesis; phenotype; respiratory distress; sepsis; support tool; training; treatment; utility,"Computer Technology Associates, Cardiff, CA, United States.; Imedacs, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.; Biocontainment Unit, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Department of Neurology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Division of Emergency Medicine, Childrens National Hospital, Washington, DC, United States.",10.2196/46807

The All of Us database offers extensive survey data pertaining to social determinants that is not routinely available in electronic health records. This study assesses whether social determinants were associated with an increased risk of developing proliferative diabetic retinopathy or related complications (e.g. related diagnoses or procedures). We identified 729 adult participants in the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program data repository with diabetic retinopathy (DR) who answered survey questions pertaining to healthcare access and utilization. Electronic health record data regarding co-morbidities, laboratory values, and procedures were extracted. Multivariable logistic regression with bi-directional stepwise variable selection was performed from a wide range of predictors. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. The mean (standard deviation) age of our cohort was 64.9 (11.4) years. 15.2% identified as Hispanic or Latino, 20.4% identified as Black, 60.6% identified as White, and 19.3% identified as Other. 10-20% of patients endorsed several reasons for avoiding or delaying care, including financial concerns and lack of access to transportation. Additional significant social determinants included race and religion discordance between healthcare provider and patient (odds ratio [OR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.41, p = 0.03) and caregiver responsibilities toward others (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.01-9.50, p = 0.04). Nationwide data demonstrate substantial barriers to healthcare access among DR patients. In addition to financial and social determinants, race and religion discordance between providers and patients may increase the likelihood of PDR and related complications.","Chan, Alison X; McDermott Iv, John J; Lee, Terrence C; Ye, Gordon Y; Shahrvini, Bita; Radha Saseendrakumar, Bharanidharan; Baxter, Sally L",PloS one,2022,Adult; Aged; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Retinopathy; Humans; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Population Health; Retinal Diseases; Surveys and Questionnaires,,"Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.",10.1371/journal.pone.0269231

This study investigated an automatic error detection algorithm for adult height and weight measurements in EHR for the All of Us Research Program (All of Us). We developed reference charts for adult heights and weights that were stratified on participant sex. Our analysis included 4,076,534 height and 5,207,328 wt measurements from ∼ 150,000 participants. Errors were identified using modified standard deviation scores, differences from their expected values, and significant changes between consecutive measurements. We evaluated our method with chart-reviewed heights (8,092) and weights (9,039) from 250 randomly selected participants and compared it with the current cleaning algorithm in All of Us. The proposed algorithm classified 1.4 % of height and 1.5 % of weight errors in the full cohort. Sensitivity was 90.4 % (95 % CI: 79.0-96.8 %) for heights and 65.9 % (95 % CI: 56.9-74.1 %) for weights. Precision was 73.4 % (95 % CI: 60.9-83.7 %) for heights and 62.9 (95 % CI: 54.0-71.1 %) for weights. In comparison, the current cleaning algorithm has inferior performance in sensitivity (55.8 %) and precision (16.5 %) for height errors while having higher precision (94.0 %) and lower sensitivity (61.9 %) for weight errors. Our proposed algorithm outperformed in detecting height errors compared to weights.

All of Us,35641135,Forecasting the future clinical events of a patient through contrastive learning.,"Deep learning models for clinical event forecasting (CEF) based on a patient's medical history have improved significantly over the past decade. However, their transition into practice has been limited, particularly for diseases with very low prevalence. In this paper, we introduce CEF-CL, a novel method based on contrastive learning to forecast in the face of a limited number of positive training instances. CEF-CL consists of two primary components: (1) unsupervised contrastive learning for patient representation and (2) supervised transfer learning over the derived representation. We evaluate the new method along with state-of-the-art model architectures trained in a supervised manner with electronic health records data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the All of Us Research Program, covering 48 000 and 16 000 patients, respectively. We assess forecasting for over 100 diagnosis codes with respect to their area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). We investigate the correlation between forecasting performance improvement and code prevalence via a Wald Test. CEF-CL achieved an average AUROC and AUPRC performance improvement over the state-of-the-art of 8.0%-9.3% and 11.7%-32.0%, respectively. The improvement in AUROC was negatively correlated with the number of positive training instances (P < .001). This investigation indicates that clinical event forecasting can be improved significantly through contrastive representation learning, especially when the number of positive training instances is small.","Zhang, Ziqi; Yan, Chao; Zhang, Xinmeng; Nyemba, Steve L; Malin, Bradley A",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2022,Electronic Health Records; Forecasting; Humans; Population Health,clinical event forecasting; contrastive learning; electronic health records; unsupervised representation learning,"Department of Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.",10.1093/jamia/ocac086
All of Us,34930020,Arrhythmia Variant Associations and Reclassifications in the eMERGE-III Sequencing Study.,"Sequencing Mendelian arrhythmia genes in individuals without an indication for arrhythmia genetic testing can identify carriers of pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants. However, the extent to which these variants are associated with clinically meaningful phenotypes before or after return of variant results is unclear. In addition, the majority of discovered variants are currently classified as variants of uncertain significance, limiting clinical actionability. The eMERGE-III study (Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Phase III) is a multicenter prospective cohort that included 21 846 participants without previous indication for cardiac genetic testing. Participants were sequenced for 109 Mendelian disease genes, including 10 linked to arrhythmia syndromes. Variant carriers were assessed with electronic health record-derived phenotypes and follow-up clinical examination. Selected variants of uncertain significance (n=50) were characterized in vitro with automated electrophysiology experiments in HEK293 cells. As previously reported, 3.0% of participants had P/LP variants in the 109 genes. Herein, we report 120 participants (0.6%) with P/LP arrhythmia variants. Compared with noncarriers, arrhythmia P/LP carriers had a significantly higher burden of arrhythmia phenotypes in their electronic health records. Fifty-four participants had variant results returned. Nineteen of these 54 participants had inherited arrhythmia syndrome diagnoses (primarily long-QT syndrome), and 12 of these 19 diagnoses were made only after variant results were returned (0.05%). After in vitro functional evaluation of 50 variants of uncertain significance, we reclassified 11 variants: 3 to likely benign and 8 to P/LP. Genome sequencing in a large population without indication for arrhythmia genetic testing identified phenotype-positive carriers of variants in congenital arrhythmia syndrome disease genes. As the genomes of large numbers of people are sequenced, the disease risk from rare variants in arrhythmia genes can be assessed by integrating genomic screening, electronic health record phenotypes, and in vitro functional studies.

The present study characterized differences between men and women with SLE. We examined cross-sectionally participants with SLE in the All of Us Research Program, a US cohort with a participant survey at enrollment (May 2018 to June 2022) and linked electronic health record (EHR) data. We described and compared characteristics of men and women with SLE encompassing disease manifestations and prescribed medications from EHR data and socioeconomic factors, including health literacy and health care access and utilization, from surveys. We reported racial variations stratified by sex. Of 1,462 participants with SLE, 126 (9%) were male. Men reported lower educational attainment and less fatigue than women. Myocardial infarction was significantly more common in men. Men had significantly less confidence in completing medical forms than women and exhibited a trend toward requiring more help in reading health-related materials. Barriers to health care access and utilization were common in both men and women (40% versus 47%, respectively, reporting some reason for delay in care; P = 0.35). Women of race other than Black or African American or White more often reported delaying care due to cultural differences between patient and provider. Our study demonstrated major clinical and health literacy differences in men and women with SLE. Socioeconomic factors were significant barriers to health care in both sexes. Our study suggests men have disproportionately poorer health literacy, which may exacerbate preexisting disparities. Further large prospective studies, focusing on recruiting men, are needed to better characterize racial differences in men with SLE.","Rice, Christopher; Ayyala, Deepak Nag; Shi, Hong; Madera-Acosta, Adria; Bell, Stephen; Qureshi, Anam; Carbone, Laura D; Coughlin, Steven S; Elam, Rachel E",Arthritis care & research,2023,"Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Race Factors; Prospective Studies; Population Health; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; White",,"Cone Health, Greensboro, North Carolina.; Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.; Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.; Augusta University and Charlie Norwood Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Augusta, Georgia.; Augusta University and Charlie Norwood Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Augusta, Georgia.; Augusta University and Charlie Norwood Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Augusta, Georgia.; Augusta University and Charlie Norwood Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Augusta, Georgia.; Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.; Augusta University and Charlie Norwood Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Augusta, Georgia.",10.1002/acr.25093

In this article, we describe functions that address common challenges we encountered while working with All of Us Research Program data, and we demonstrate this functionality with an example of creating a cohort of All of Us participants by synthesizing electronic health record and survey data with time dependencies. All of Us Research Program data are widely available to health researchers. The allofus R package is aimed at a wide range of researchers who wish to conduct complex analyses using best practices for reproducibility and transparency, and who have a range of experience using R. Because the All of Us data are transformed into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM), researchers familiar with existing OMOP CDM tools or who wish to conduct network studies in conjunction with other OMOP CDM data will also find value in the package. We developed an initial set of functions that solve problems we experienced across survey and electronic health record data in our own research and in mentoring student projects. The package will continue to grow and develop with the All of Us Research Program.

However, the effect of neuropsychiatric conditions on long-term adolescent and young adult cancer (AYAC) survivors has not been formally investigated. Thus, the impact and management of late neuropsychiatric complications in AYAC survivors compared to non-cancer-matched controls (NCMC) in the US were evaluated using the All of Us (AoU) Research Program. Participants in the AoU Controlled Tier Dataset (v6) diagnosed with cancer between ages 15 and 39 were identified from electronic health records and surveys. AYAC survivors were matched with NCMC using the optimal pair-matching algorithm at a 1:4 ratio. Data on past diagnoses, current follow-up care, and treatment patterns of neuropsychiatric complications were collected. Analysis was performed on 788 AYAC survivors and 3152 NCMC. AYAC survivors, with an average of 8.8 years since their first cancer diagnosis, were more likely than NCMC to receive a diagnosis of neuropathy, memory loss and epilepsy (p  < 0.001). Survivors also had a higher rate of follow-up care and treatment utilization for these neurological conditions compared to NCMC (p  < 0.05). Treatment utilization was highest among survivors receiving care for epilepsy (88%), and lower for neuropathy (70%), memory loss (61%), and chronic fatigue (59%). This large study reveals that AYAC survivors, on average 9 years after their cancer diagnosis, require more frequent follow-up care for neurological complications compared to non-cancer individuals. However, the management of neuropathy, memory loss, and chronic fatigue is hindered by a lack of mechanism-based effective therapies.","Agapito, Ivann; Ng, Ding Quan; Milam, Joel; Ziogas, Argyrios; Anton-Culver, Hoda; Chan, Alexandre",Cancer medicine,2023,"Humans; Adolescent; Young Adult; United States; Adult; Cancer Survivors; Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic; Population Health; Neoplasms; Memory Disorders; Epilepsy",All of Us; adolescent and young adult cancer; matched controls; neuropsychiatric; past medical history; survivor,"School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.; School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.; School of Medicine, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.; Program in Public Health, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.; School of Medicine, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.; School of Medicine, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.; School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California, USA.",10.1002/cam4.6641

Usually, the symptomatology is preceded by a viral infection including influenza, parainfluenza, rotavirus, and mycoplasma. The case series was conducted in four pediatric hospitals in Catania, Italy, over a 12-year observational period. Clinical examination, laboratory data, course, treatment, and complications of the affected children were extracted from electronic medical records of each hospital. For the case series, 50 children diagnosed with BACM were enrolled: the mean age of affected children was 5.35 years, 86% of were males, and in 56% the affections occurred during the winter. In the affected children, the clinical picture was characterized by previous fever and/or symptoms of inflammation of the upper airways, and followed by pain in the lower extremities up to uncoordinated gait.

All of Us,36540962,Risk for Poor Post-Operative Quality of Life Among Wearable Use Subgroups in an All of Us Research Cohort.,"The objective of this research was to build and assess the performance of a prediction model for post-operative recovery status measured by quality of life among individuals experiencing a variety of surgery types. In addition, we assessed the performance of the model for two subgroups (high and moderately consistent wearable device users). Study variables were derived from the electronic health records, questionnaires, and wearable devices of a cohort of individuals with one of 8 surgery types and that were part of the NIH All of Us research program. Through multivariable analysis, high frailty index (OR 1.69, 95% 1.05-7.22, p<0.006), and older age (OR 1.76, 95% 1.55-4.08, p<0.024) were found to be the driving risk factors of poor recovery post-surgery. Our logistic regression model included 15 variables, 5 of which included wearable device data. In wearable use subgroups, the model had better accuracy for high wearable users (81%). Findings demonstrate the potential for models that use wearable measures to assess frailty to inform clinicians of patients at risk for poor surgical outcomes. Our model performed with high accuracy across multiple surgery types and were robust to variable consistency in wearable use.","Soley, Nidhi; Song, Shanshan; Flaks-Manov, Natalie; Taylor, Casey Overby",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

All of Us,39976965,Cancer Risk and Estimated Lithium Exposure in Drinking Groundwater in the US.,"Lithium is a naturally occurring element in drinking water and is commonly used as a mood-stabilizing medication. Although clinical studies have reported associations between receiving lithium treatment and reduced cancer risk among patients with bipolar disorder, to our knowledge, the association between environmental lithium exposure and cancer risk has never been studied in the general population. To evaluate the association between exposure to lithium in drinking groundwater and cancer risk in the general population. This cohort study included participants with electronic health record and residential address information but without cancer history at baseline from the All of Us Research Program between May 31, 2017, and June 30, 2022. Participants were followed up until February 15, 2023. Statistical analysis was performed from September 2023 through October 2024. Lithium concentration in groundwater, based on kriging interpolation of publicly available US Geological Survey data on lithium concentration for 4700 wells across the contiguous US between May 12, 1999, and November 6, 2018. The main outcome was cancer diagnosis or condition, obtained from electronic health records. Stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for risk of cancer overall and individual cancer types for increasing quintiles of the estimated lithium exposure in drinking groundwater, adjusting for socioeconomic, behavioral, and neighborhood-level variables. The analysis was further conducted in the western and eastern halves of the US and restricted to long-term residents living at their current address for at least 3 years. A total of 252 178 participants were included (median age, 52 years [IQR, 36-64 years]; 60.1% female). The median follow-up time was 3.6 years (IQR, 3.0-4.3 years), and 7573 incident cancer cases were identified. Higher estimated lithium exposure was consistently associated with reduced cancer risk. Compared with the first (lowest) quintile of lithium exposure, the HR for all cancers was 0.49 (95% CI, 0.31-0.78) for the fourth quintile and 0.29 (95% CI, 0.15-0.55) for the fifth quintile. These associations were found for all cancer types investigated in both females and males, among long-term residents, and in both western and eastern states. For example, for the fifth vs first quintile of lithium exposure for all cancers, the HR was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.07-0.42) in females and 0.13 (95% CI, 0.04-0.38) in males; for long-term residents, the HR was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.15-0.66) in females and 0.24 (95% CI, 0.11-0.52) in males; and the HR was 0.01 (95% CI, 0.00-0.09) in western states and 0.34 (95% CI, 0.21-0.57) in eastern states. In this cohort study of 252 178 participants, estimated lithium exposure in drinking groundwater was associated with reduced cancer risk. Given the sparse evidence and unknown mechanisms of this association, follow-up investigation is warranted.","Luo, Jiajun; Zheng, Liang; Jin, Zhihao; Yang, Yuqing; Krakowka, William Isaac; Hong, Eric; Lombard, Melissa; Ayotte, Joseph; Ahsan, Habibul; Pinto, Jayant M; Aschebrook-Kilfoy, Briseis",JAMA network open,2025,"Humans; Female; Male; Groundwater; Middle Aged; Lithium; Adult; Drinking Water; United States; Neoplasms; Environmental Exposure; Cohort Studies; Aged; Risk Factors; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Proportional Hazards Models",,"Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago Biological Science Division, Chicago, Illinois.; Institute for Population and Precision Health, The University of Chicago Biological Science Division, Chicago, Illinois.; Department of Thyroid Surgery, The First Hospital Affiliated With Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.; Gangarosa Department of Environmental Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.; Institute for Population and Precision Health, The University of Chicago Biological Science Division, Chicago, Illinois.; Institute for Population and Precision Health, The University of Chicago Biological Science Division, Chicago, Illinois.; Institute for Population and Precision Health, The University of Chicago Biological Science Division, Chicago, Illinois.; New England Water Science Center, US Geological Survey, Pembroke, New Hampshire.; New England Water Science Center, US Geological Survey, Pembroke, New Hampshire.; Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago Biological Science Division, Chicago, Illinois.; Institute for Population and Precision Health, The University of Chicago Biological Science Division, Chicago, Illinois.; Department of Family Medicine, The University of Chicago Biological Science Division, Chicago, Illinois.; Department of Surgery, The University of Chicago Biological Science Division, Chicago, Illinois.; Department of Public Health Sciences, The University of Chicago Biological Science Division, Chicago, Illinois.; Institute for Population and Precision Health, The University of Chicago Biological Science Division, Chicago, Illinois.; Department of Family Medicine, The University of Chicago Biological Science Division, Chicago, Illinois.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.60854

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of opioid use and its association with sociodemographic characteristics from survey data and electronic health record (EHR). A total of 214,206 participants were included in this study who competed survey modules and shared EHR data. Adjusted logistic regressions were used to explore the associations between sociodemographic characteristics and opioid use. The lifetime prevalence of street opioids was 4%, and the nonmedical use of prescription opioids was 9%. Men had higher odds of lifetime opioid use (aOR: 1.4 to 3.1) but reduced odds of current nonmedical use of prescription opioids (aOR: 0.6). Participants from other racial and ethnic groups were at reduced odds of lifetime use (aOR: 0.2 to 0.9) but increased odds of current use (aOR: 1.9 to 9.9) compared with non-Hispanic White participants. Foreign-born participants were at reduced risks of opioid use and diagnosed with opioid use disorders (OUD) compared with US-born participants (aOR: 0.36 to 0.67). Men, Younger, White, and US-born participants are more likely to have OUD. All of Us research data can be used as an indicator of national trends for monitoring the prevalence of receiving prescription opioids, diagnosis of OUD, and non-medical use of opioids in the US. The program employs a longitudinal design for routinely collecting health-related data including EHR data, that will contribute to the literature by providing important clinical information related to opioids over time. Additionally, this data will enhance the estimates of the prevalence of OUD among diverse populations, including groups that are underrepresented in the national survey data.","Yeh, Hsueh-Han; Peltz-Rauchman, Cathryn; Johnson, Christine C; Pawloski, Pamala A; Chesla, David; Waring, Stephen C; Stevens, Alan B; Epstein, Mara; Joseph, Christine; Miller-Matero, Lisa R; Gui, Hongsheng; Tang, Amy; Boerwinkle, Eric; Cicek, Mine; Clark, Cheryl R; Cohn, Elizabeth; Gebo, Kelly; Loperena, Roxana; Mayo, Kelsey; Mockrin, Stephen; Ohno-Machado, Lucila; Schully, Sheri; Ramirez, Andrea H; Qian, Jun; Ahmedani, Brian K",PloS one,2023,"Male; Humans; Analgesics, Opioid; Population Health; Opioid-Related Disorders; Electronic Health Records; Ethnicity",,"Center for Health Policy and Health Services Research, Henry Ford Health, Detroit, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Public Health Sciences, Henry Ford Health, Detroit, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Public Health Sciences, Henry Ford Health, Detroit, Michigan, United States of America.; HealthPartners Institute, Bloomington, Minnesota, United States of America.; Office of Research and Education, Spectrum Health, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States of America.; Essentia Health, Essentia Institute of Rural Health, Duluth, Minnesota, United States of America.; Center for Applied Health Research, Baylor Scott & White Health, Temple, Texas, United States of America.; Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Department of Public Health Sciences, Henry Ford Health, Detroit, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Health Policy and Health Services Research, Henry Ford Health, Detroit, Michigan, United States of America.; Behavioral Health Services, Henry Ford Health, Detroit, Michigan, United States of America.; Behavioral Health Services, Henry Ford Health, Detroit, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Public Health Sciences, Henry Ford Health, Detroit, Michigan, United States of America.; School of Public Health, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, United States of America.; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America.; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing, Hunter College, City University of New York, New York, New York, United States of America.; Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.; Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; All of Us Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, UCSD Health, La Jolla, California, United States of America.; All of Us Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Center for Health Policy and Health Services Research, Henry Ford Health, Detroit, Michigan, United States of America.; Behavioral Health Services, Henry Ford Health, Detroit, Michigan, United States of America.",10.1371/journal.pone.0290416

A comprehensive literature review was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), investigating the efficacy of endoscopic treatments for the management of 6-20 mm nonpedunculated colorectal polyps. Primary outcomes were complete and en bloc resection rates and adverse event rate was the secondary. Effect size on outcomes is presented as risk ratio (RR; 95% confidence interval [CI]). Fourteen RCTs (5219 polypectomies) were included. Endoscopic mucosal resection(EMR) significantly outperformed cold snare polypectomy(CSP) in terms of complete [(RR 95%CI): 1.04(1.00-1.07)] and en bloc resection rate [RR:1.12(1.04-1.21)]. EMR was superior to hot snare polypectomy (HSP) [RR:1.04(1.00-1.08)] regarding complete resection, while underwater EMR (U-EMR) achieved significantly higher rate of en bloc resection compared to CSP [RR:1.15(1.01-1.30)]. EMR yielded the highest ranking for complete resection(SUCRA-score 0.81), followed by cold-snare EMR(CS-EMR,SUCRA-score 0.76). None of the modalities was different regarding adverse event rate compared to CSP, however EMR and CS-EMR resulted in fewer adverse events compared to HSP [RR:0.44(0.26-0.77) and 0.43(0.21-0.87),respectively].

Studies investigating the relationship between LP and clinically diagnosed anxiety and depression are limited. We aimed to determine the association of LP with anxiety and depression by conducting a cross-sectional population study of the All of Us research database, a National Institutes of Health cohort. Patients with LP were identified through electronic health record data using codes from the International Classification of Diseases and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess associations between LP and anxiety and depression before and after controlling for relevant covariates. Among 239,552 participants, 1083 individuals with LP were identified, with an average age of 67.20 years (standard deviation, 11.79) and a female predominance (74% female). The prevalence of depression and anxiety were higher among individuals with LP than in those without (41.6% vs 27.7%, p < 0.001; 43.5% vs 29.6%, p < 0.001).

All of Us,35583884,Proposing a Sex-Adjusted Sodium-Adjusted MELD Score for Liver Transplant Allocation.,"Liver allocation is determined by the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), a scoring system based on 4 laboratory measurements. During the MELD era, sex disparities in liver transplant have increased and there are no modifications to MELD based on sex. To use laboratory values stored in electronic health records to describe population-level sex differences in all MELD laboratory values (in healthy individuals and patients with liver disease) and propose a sex adjustment. A retrospective cohort study was conducted from March 2019 to April 2020 to evaluate sex differences in laboratory values in liver transplant patients, patients with liver disease who did not undergo transplant, and healthy controls. Primary analyses were conducted in Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC)'s deidentified electronic health record system. Replication analyses were conducted in the All of Us Research Program. Simulations of a sex-adjusted sodium-adjusted MELD (MELDNa) score were completed using liver transplant waiting list data from the liver simulated allocation modeling system. Patients who regularly used VUMC with measurements for any MELDNa component laboratory were included in the analyses. Analysis took place from November 2019 to March 2021. Electronic health record-reported sex. Creatinine, bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and sodium levels. The VUMC sample was composed of 623 931 individuals (359 976 [57.7%] female) with a median (IQR) age of 44 (23-61) years. All component MELDNa laboratory values and calculated MELDNa scores yielded significant sex differences within VUMC (mean [SD] creatinine: male, 0.99 [0.39] mg/dL; female, 0.79 [0.30] mg/dL; P < .001; bilirubin: male, 0.76 [0.83] mg/dL; female, 0.58 [0.64] mg/dL; P < .001; international normalized ratio of prothrombin rate: male, 1.24 [0.42]; female, 1.20 [0.40]; P < .001; sodium: male, 139.00 [2.36] mEq/L; female, 139.03 [2.28] mEq/L; P < .001), resulting in MELDNa scoring that disadvantaged female individuals. This pattern persisted when the sample was divided into healthy controls, individuals with liver disease who did not undergo transplant, and patients who did undergo liver transplant. Female transplant patients had a greater number of decompensation traits (mean [SD]: male, 1.34 [1.11]; female, 1.60 [1.09]; P = .005), despite having lower MELDNa scores (mean [SD]: male, 21.72 [6.11]; female, 20.21 [6.15]; P = .005), indicating MELDNa scores are not accurately representing disease severity in female individuals. In simulations, the sex-adjusted MELDNa score modestly increased female transplant rate and decreased overall death. These results demonstrate pervasive sex differences in all laboratory values used in MELDNa scoring and highlight the need and utility of a sex-adjustment to the MELDNa protocol.","Sealock, Julia M; Ziogas, Ioannis A; Zhao, Zhiguo; Ye, Fei; Alexopoulos, Sophoclis P; Matsuoka, Lea; Chen, Guanhua; Davis, Lea K",JAMA surgery,2022,Adult; Bilirubin; Creatinine; End Stage Liver Disease; Female; Humans; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Population Health; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Sodium; Waiting Lists,,"Division of Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Division of Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Division of Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Division of Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison.; Division of Genetic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Medicine and Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.",10.1001/jamasurg.2022.1548

Aim of this study was to explore the distribution of subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D) by cardiovascular risk groups according to the ESC classification and to describe the quality indicators of care. The study is based on data extracted from electronic medical records of patients treated at the 258 Italian diabetes centers participating in the AMD (Associazione Medici Diabetologi) Annals initiative. Patients with T1D were stratified by cardiovascular risk. Measures of intermediate outcomes, intensity/appropriateness of pharmacological treatment, and overall quality of care were evaluated. Overall, 29.368 subjects with type 1 diabetes (64.7% at very high cardiovascular risk, 28.5% at high risk and 6.8% at moderate risk) were evaluated. A lack of use of drugs in case of high values and an inadequate control despite the antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment was recognized. The overall quality of care tended to be lower as the level of cardiovascular risk increased. A large proportion of subjects with T1D is at high or very high risk. Antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment seem not adequately used.

All of Us,40074206,Association of daily steps over time with adult asthma incidence.,"Higher daily step counts is associated with reduced risk of many chronic diseases. Increased physical activity improves asthma outcomes. There are no known prevention strategies for adult incident asthma. We sought to determine whether objective physical activity affects adult asthma incidence. Participants in the All of Us Research Program retrospective cohort aged ≥18 years with linked personal activity tracker and electronic health record data met the inclusion criteria. Asthma was defined as two relevant ICD-9/10 codes and prescription of ≥1 medication. Participants with an asthma diagnosis date before or within 6 months of activity-monitor initiation were assigned to the prevalent asthma group; participants diagnosed after 6 months of activity monitoring were assigned to the incident asthma group. A total of 8,360 participants were included. Median average steps per day were higher among asthma-free participants (7,795; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5,879-9,921, n = 7,700) than participants with prevalent (6,968; 95% CI, 5,036-9,014, n = 450) or incident (6,953; 95% CI, 5,215-8,261, n = 210) asthma (P < .0001). Significant time-by-incident asthma interaction was observed with a greater decline in steps per day over time in the incident asthma cohort (P = .018). An inverse relationship was observed between average steps per day and asthma incidence after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, major depressive disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive lung disease (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.93, 95% CI, 0.88-0.98 per 1,000 average daily step increase). Objectively measured daily steps are lower in adults who develop incident asthma and may represent a modifiable risk factor to reduce asthma incidence. Future studies should objectively monitor physical activity among adults at risk for and with asthma.","Halevi, Joshua C; Annis, Jeffrey; Master, Hiral; Kahwash, Basil M; Brittain, Evan L; Cahill, Katherine N",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2025,Humans; Asthma; Male; Female; Incidence; Adult; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Exercise; United States; Aged,Incident asthma; activity; exercise; risk factors; step counts; wearable electronic devices,"Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn; Vanderbilt Institute of Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn; Vanderbilt Institute of Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn; Vanderbilt Institute of Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tenn.

Essential to the verification of biobanks is a replication of known associations to establish validity. Here, we evaluated how well All of Us data replicated known cigarette smoking associations. We defined smoking exposure as follows: (1) an EHR Smoking exposure that used International Classification of Disease codes; (2) participant provided information (PPI) Ever Smoking; and, (3) PPI Current Smoking, both from the lifestyle survey. We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) for each smoking exposure measurement type. For each, we compared the effect sizes derived from the PheWAS to published meta-analyses that studied cigarette smoking from PubMed. We defined two levels of replication of meta-analyses: (1) nominally replicated: which required agreement of direction of effect size, and (2) fully replicated: which required overlap of confidence intervals. PheWASes with EHR Smoking, PPI Ever Smoking, and PPI Current Smoking revealed 736, 492, and 639 phenome-wide significant associations, respectively. We identified 165 meta-analyses representing 99 distinct phenotypes that could be matched to EHR phenotypes. At P < .05, 74 were nominally replicated and 55 were fully replicated. At P < 2.68 × 10-5 (Bonferroni threshold), 58 were nominally replicated and 40 were fully replicated. Most phenotypes found in published meta-analyses associated with smoking were nominally replicated in All of Us. Both survey and EHR definitions for smoking produced similar results.

Our objective was to analyze weight trends in the U.S. using a nationally representative dataset that incorporates longitudinal electronic health record data. Using the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program (AoU) dataset, we identified patients aged 18-70 years old who had at least two height and weight measurements within a 5-year period from 2008 to 2021. Baseline and most recent BMI values were used to calculate total body weight (%TBW) changes. %TBW change predictors were determined using multivariable linear regression. We included 30,862 patients (mean age 48.9 [ ± 12.6] years; 60.5% female). At the 5-year follow-up, the prevalences of obesity and severe obesity were 37.4% and 20.7%, respectively. The frequency of patients with normal weight or overweight BMI who gained ≥5% TBW at follow-up was 37.8% and 33.1%, respectively. Nearly 24% of the cohort lost ≥ 5% TBW, and 6.5% with severe obesity lost weight to achieve a BMI < 30 kg/m This evaluation of an NIH-partnered dataset suggests that patients are continuing to gain weight in the U.S. AoU represents a unique tool for obesity prediction, prevention, and treatment given its longitudinal nature and unique behavioral and genetic data.","Jawara, Dawda; Krebsbach, Craig M; Venkatesh, Manasa; Murtha, Jacqueline A; Hanlon, Bret M; Lauer, Kate V; Stalter, Lily N; Funk, Luke M",International journal of obesity (2005),2025,Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Female; Adult; United States; Longitudinal Studies; Obesity; Aged; National Institutes of Health (U.S.); Young Adult; Adolescent; Body Mass Index; Prevalence; Body Weight,,"Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.; Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.; Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.; Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.; Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.; Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.; Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.; Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.; Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA. funk@surgery.wisc.edu.; Department of Surgery, William S.

From 5677 participants in the All of Us Research Program (median age 51 years; 74% female; 89% White), there were 97 (2%) cases of incident T2DM over a median follow-up period of 3.8 years between 2010 to 2021. In models adjusted for age, sex, and race, the hazard of incident diabetes was reduced by 44% (95% CI, 15%-63%; P = 0.01) when comparing those with an average daily step count of 10 700 to those with 6000. Similar benefits were seen comparing groups based on average duration of various intensities of activity (eg, lightly active, fairly active, very active). There was no evidence for effect modification by age, sex, BMI, or sedentary time. Greater time in any type of physical activity intensity was associated with lower risk of T2DM irrespective of age, sex, BMI, or sedentary time.","Perry, Andrew S; Annis, Jeffrey S; Master, Hiral; Nayor, Matthew; Hughes, Andrew; Kouame, Aymone; Natarajan, Karthik; Marginean, Kayla; Murthy, Venkatesh; Roden, Dan M; Harris, Paul A; Shah, Ravi; Brittain, Evan L",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2023,"Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Male; United States; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Risk Factors; Population Health; Body Mass Index; National Institutes of Health (U.S.); Incidence",activity monitoring; diabetes; physical activity; risk factors,"Vanderbilt Translational and Clinical Cardiovascular Research Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.; Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.; Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.; Sections of Cardiovascular Medicine and Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118, USA.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.; Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.; Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.; Department of Medicine and Radiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.; Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.; Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.; Vanderbilt Translational and Clinical Cardiovascular Research Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.; Vanderbilt Translational and Clinical Cardiovascular Research Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37203, USA.",10.1210/clinem/dgac695

Aim of this study was to explore the distribution of subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) by cardiovascular risk groups according to the ESC classification and to describe the quality indicators of care, with particular regard to cardiovascular risk factors. The study is based on data extracted from electronic medical records of patients treated at the 258 Italian diabetes centers participating in the AMD Annals initiative. Patients with T2D were stratified by cardiovascular risk. General descriptive indicators, measures of intermediate outcomes, intensity/appropriateness of pharmacological treatment for diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, presence of other complications and overall quality of care were evaluated. Overall, 473,740 subjects with type 2 diabetes (78.5% at very high cardiovascular risk, 20.9% at high risk and 0.6% at moderate risk) were evaluated. Among people with T2D at very high risk: 26.4% had retinopathy, 39.5% had albuminuria, 18.7% had a previous major cardiovascular event, 39.0% had organ damage, 89.1% had three or more risk factors. The use of DPP4-i markedly increased as cardiovascular risk increased. The prescription of secretagogues also increased and that of GLP1-RAs tended to increase. The use of SGLT2-i was still limited, and only slightly higher in subjects with very high cardiovascular risk. The overall quality of care, as summarized by the Q score, tended to be lower as the level of cardiovascular risk increased. A large proportion of subjects with T2D is at high or very high risk. Glucose-lowering drug therapies seem not to be adequately used with respect to their potential advantages in terms of cardiovascular risk reduction. Several actions are necessary to improve the quality of care.","Pintaudi, Basilio; Scatena, Alessia; Piscitelli, Gabriella; Frison, Vera; Corrao, Salvatore; Manicardi, Valeria; Graziano, Giusi; Rossi, Maria Chiara; Gallo, Marco; Mannino, Domenico; Di Bartolo, Paolo; Nicolucci, Antonio",Cardiovascular diabetology,2021,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors; Electronic Health Records; Female; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incretins; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",Cardiovascular risk; Quality of care; Type 2 diabetes,"Diabetes Unit, Niguarda Cà Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy.; San Donato Hospital, Arezzo, Italy.; Diabetology, ASST Nord Milan, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy.; Internal Medicine and Diabetology Service, ULSS6, Cittadella, Italy.; Department of Internal Medicine, ARNAS Civico Benfratelli Hospital, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.; Diabetes Clinic, Azienda USL-IRCCS Di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.; Center for Outcomes Research and Clinical Epidemiology, CORESEARCH, Corso Umberto I, 65122, Pescara, Italy.; Center for Outcomes Research and Clinical Epidemiology, CORESEARCH, Corso Umberto I, 65122, Pescara, Italy.; AOU Città Della Salute E Della Scienza, Presidio Ospedaliero Molinette, Torino, Italy.; Endocrinology and Metabolic Unit, GOM, Reggio Calabria, Italy.; AUSL Diabetes Unit Romagna, Ravenna, Italy.; Center for Outcomes Research and Clinical Epidemiology, CORESEARCH, Corso Umberto I, 65122, Pescara, Italy. nicolucci@coresearch.it.",10.1186/s12933-021-01251-4
All of Us,40266617,Detection Bias in EHR-Based Research on Clinical Exposures and Dementia.,"Detection bias occurs when an exposure is associated with a systematic difference in outcome ascertainment or diagnosis. For dementia research, diagnosed health conditions that bring patients into frequent interaction with health care may increase the chance that an individual receives a dementia diagnosis. To evaluate potential detection bias or misdiagnosis bias in evaluation of clinical factors associated with dementia using electronic health record (EHR) data. This prospective cohort study used data from 2 population-based volunteer cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB) and All of Us (AOU). Participants were aged 55 years or older, were dementia-free at baseline, and had linked EHRs. Participants in UKB were followed up from baseline (2006-2010) until December 2022, and in AOU, from baseline (2017-2022) until July 2022. Data were analyzed from November 2023 through February 2025. Diagnoses of type 2 diabetes, depression, hypertension, urinary tract infection, kidney stones, forearm fracture, and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Rate of incident all-cause dementia diagnosis from EHRs and associations between clinical exposures and incident dementia diagnosis, assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Among 228 392 participants from UKB (n = 137 374; mean [SD] age at baseline, 62.5 [4.1] years; 53.8% female) and AOU (n = 91 018; mean [SD] age at baseline, 66.9 [7.8] years; 57.1% female), those with a history of a clinical exposure at baseline had higher dementia incidence rates compared with those without such history. For example, among participants with a history of GI bleeding, the dementia incidence rates were 3.0 (UKB) and 7.7 (AOU) per 1000 person-years compared with 2.2 (UKB) and 2.4 (AOU) per 1000 person-years among those without a history of GI bleeding. All exposures were significantly associated with incident dementia, with hazard ratios (HRs) ranging from 1.18 (95% CI, 1.00-1.40) to 3.51 (95% CI, 3.08-4.01). Risk of incident dementia was typically highest in the first year following exposure diagnosis and attenuated thereafter. For example, in the first year after GI bleeding, there were larger elevations in risk of incident dementia (HR, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.46-3.22] in UKB; HR, 2.56 [95% CI, 1.62-4.04] in AOU) compared with 1 to 5 years after bleeding (HR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.15-1.86] in UKB; HR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.63-2.81] in AOU). In this cohort study of 2 large datasets, diagnoses of several conditions associated with varying risks of dementia were associated with a higher short-term likelihood of dementia diagnosis. This finding suggests that diagnostic bias or misdiagnoses may lead to spurious associations between conditions requiring clinical care and subsequent dementia diagnoses.","Wang, Jingxuan; Choi, Minhyuk; Buto, Peter; Kelly, J Daniel; La Joie, Renaud; Kornak, John; Zimmerman, Scott C; Chen, Ruijia; Raphael, Eva; Schaefer, Catherine A; Blacker, Deborah; Glymour, M Maria",JAMA network open,2025,"Humans; Dementia; Female; Male; Electronic Health Records; Aged; Prospective Studies; Middle Aged; Bias; United Kingdom; United States; Diagnostic Errors; Aged, 80 and over",,"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; F.I.

A retrospective, longitudinal cohort study leveraging a national electronic health record (EHR) database administered by the National Institutes of Health. Eye patients in the All of Us Research Program database with at least 15 months of follow-up and 1 BP measurement. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models predicted the risk of developing incident open-angle glaucoma (OAG). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the number of BP medication classes were entered as time-varying predictors to account for changes over time. The risk of developing incident OAG, as defined by billing diagnosis codes. Of 20 815 eligible eye patients who qualified for this study, 462 developed OAG. Low BP (MAP < 83.0 mmHg) was associated with increased risk of developing OAG (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.67). High BP (MAP > 101.3 mmHg) and the number of BP medication classes were not associated with OAG after adjustment for covariates. Other risk factors associated with OAG included being Black (HR, 3.31, 95% CI, 2.63-4.17), Hispanic or Latino (HR, 2.53, 95% CI, 1.94-3.28), Asian (HR, 2.22, 95% CI, 1.24-3.97), older in age (80+ years, HR, 20.1, 95% CI, 9.10-44.5), and diabetic (HR, 1.32, 95% CI, 1.04-1.67). Female gender was associated with decreased hazard of developing OAG (HR, 0.66, 95% CI, 0.55-0.80). No significant interaction was observed between MAP and the number of BP medications on the risk of developing OAG. We found that low BP is associated with increased risk of developing OAG in a national longitudinal EHR database. We did not find evidence supporting a differential effect of medically treated and untreated low BP. This study adds to the body of literature implicating vascular dysregulation as a potential etiology for the development of OAG, particularly emphasizing the lack of influence of BP medications on this relationship.","Lee, Eric B; Hu, Wendeng; Singh, Kuldev; Wang, Sophia Y",Ophthalmology,2022,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antihypertensive Agents; Blood Pressure; Databases, Factual; Electronic Health Records; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; United States",Blood pressure; Blood pressure medications; Electronic health records; Glaucoma; Risk factors,"Byers Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.; Byers Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.; Byers Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.; Byers Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.

A better understanding of the molecular features of mccRCC could identify a prognostic and/or predictive role for ccRCC genomic alterations. In this real-world observational study based on the nationwide (US-based) de-identified Flatiron Health-Foundation Medicine, Inc. clinico-genomic database (FH-FMI-CGDB), we investigate the frequency and co-occurrence of genomic alterations in mccRCC patients and assess their prognostic role. Patients (n = 858) were adults diagnosed with mccRCC, with FH electronic health records between 2011 and 2022. The top 10 mutated genes were VHL (73.9%), PBRM1 (42.4%), SETD2 (25.3%), CDKN2A (20.0%), BAP1 (16.4%), CDKN2B (16.0%), KDM5C (14.5%), TP53 (12.9%), PTEN (11.7%), and TERT (9.2%). Eight genes showed prognostic value: CDKN2A, CDKN2B, TP53, PTEN, NF2, PIK3CA, and MTAP were linked to worse prognosis, whereas PBRM1 was associated with better overall survival (OS). Two of the three identified gene clusters had prognostic value: cluster 1 (VHL, SETD2, PBRM1, KDM5C, NFE2L2) correlated with better OS [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.63, P < 0.001], whereas cluster 3 (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, BAP1, NF2, MTAP) correlated with shorter OS (aHR 1.36, P = 0.023). We identified eight genes and two gene clusters with prognostic significance for mccRCC.

The human genomics enterprise is now in the midst of an important transition, as the growing foundation of genomic knowledge is being used by researchers and clinicians to tackle increasingly complex problems in biomedicine. Of particular prominence is the use of revolutionary new DNA sequencing technologies for generating prodigious amounts of DNA sequence data to elucidate the complexities of genome structure, function, and evolution, as well as to unravel the genomic bases of rare and common diseases. Together, these developments are ushering in the era of genomic medicine. Augmenting the advances in human genomics have been innovations in technologies for measuring environmental and lifestyle information, electronic health records, and data science; together, these provide opportunities of unprecedented scale and scope for investigating the underpinnings of health and disease. To capitalize on these opportunities, U.S. President Barack Obama recently announced a major new research endeavor - the U.S. Precision Medicine Initiative. This bold effort will be framed around several key aims, which include accelerating the use of genomically informed approaches to cancer care, making important policy and regulatory changes, and establishing a large research cohort of >1 million volunteers to facilitate precision medicine research. The latter will include making the partnership with all participants a centerpiece feature in the cohort's design and development.

All of Us,37301967,Using machine learning to develop a clinical prediction model for SSRI-associated bleeding: a feasibility study.,"Adverse drug events (ADEs) are associated with poor outcomes and increased costs but may be prevented with prediction tools. With the National Institute of Health All of Us (AoU) database, we employed machine learning (ML) to predict selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated bleeding. The AoU program, beginning in 05/2018, continues to recruit ≥ 18 years old individuals across the United States. Participants completed surveys and consented to contribute electronic health record (EHR) for research. Using the EHR, we determined participants who were exposed to SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, vortioxetine). Features (n = 88) were selected with clinicians' input and comprised sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidities, and medication use information. We identified bleeding events with validated EHR algorithms and applied logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boost to predict bleeding during SSRI exposure. We assessed model performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistic (AUC) and defined clinically significant features as resulting in > 0.01 decline in AUC after removal from the model, in three of four ML models. There were 10,362 participants exposed to SSRIs, with 9.6% experiencing a bleeding event during SSRI exposure. For each SSRI, performance across all four ML models was relatively consistent. AUCs from the best models ranged 0.632-0.698. Clinically significant features included health literacy for escitalopram, and bleeding history and socioeconomic status for all SSRIs. We demonstrated feasibility of predicting ADEs using ML. Incorporating genomic features and drug interactions with deep learning models may improve ADE prediction.","Goyal, Jatin; Ng, Ding Quan; Zhang, Kevin; Chan, Alexandre; Lee, Joyce; Zheng, Kai; Hurley-Kim, Keri; Nguyen, Lee; He, Lu; Nguyen, Megan; McBane, Sarah; Li, Wei; Cadiz, Christine Luu",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2023,"Humans; United States; Adolescent; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; Feasibility Studies; Escitalopram; Models, Statistical; Population Health; Prognosis; Machine Learning",Adverse drug events; Bleeding; Electronic health records; Machine learning; Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors,"Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy Practice, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California Irvine, 802 W Peltason Dr, Irvine, CA, 92697-4625, USA.; Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy Practice, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California Irvine, 802 W Peltason Dr, Irvine, CA, 92697-4625, USA.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy Practice, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California Irvine, 802 W Peltason Dr, Irvine, CA, 92697-4625, USA.; Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy Practice, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California Irvine, 802 W Peltason Dr, Irvine, CA, 92697-4625, USA.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy Practice, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California Irvine, 802 W Peltason Dr, Irvine, CA, 92697-4625, USA.; Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy Practice, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California Irvine, 802 W Peltason Dr, Irvine, CA, 92697-4625, USA.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy Practice, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California Irvine, 802 W Peltason Dr, Irvine, CA, 92697-4625, USA.; Division of Computational Biomedicine, Department of Biological Chemistry, School of Medicine, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy Practice, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California Irvine, 802 W Peltason Dr, Irvine, CA, 92697-4625, USA.

All of Us,39401251,Health disparities in the risk of severe acidosis: real-world evidence from the All of Us cohort.,"To assess the health disparities across social determinants of health (SDoH) domains for the risk of severe acidosis independent of demographical and clinical factors. A retrospective case-control study (n = 13 310, 1:4 matching) is performed using electronic health records (EHRs), SDoH surveys, and genomics data from the All of Us participants. The propensity score matching controls confounding effects due to EHR data availability. Conditional logistic regressions are used to estimate odds ratios describing associations between SDoHs and the risk of acidosis events, adjusted for demographic features, and clinical conditions. Those with employer-provided insurance and those with Medicaid plans show dramatically different risks [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 0.761 vs 1.41]. Low-income groups demonstrate higher risk (household income less than $25k, AOR: 1.3-1.57) than high-income groups ($100-$200k, AOR: 0.597-0.867). Other high-risk factors include impaired mobility (AOR: 1.32), unemployment (AOR: 1.32), renters (AOR: 1.41), other non-house-owners (AOR: 1.7), and house instability (AOR: 1.25). Education was negatively associated with acidosis risk. Our work provides real-world evidence of the comprehensive health disparities due to socioeconomic and behavioral contributors in a cohort enriched in minority groups or underrepresented populations. SDoHs are strongly associated with systematic health disparities in the risk of severe metabolic acidosis. Types of health insurance, household income levels, housing status and stability, employment status, educational level, and mobility disability play significant roles after being adjusted for demographic features and clinical conditions. Comprehensive solutions are needed to improve equity in healthcare and reduce the risk of severe acidosis.","Gatz, Allison E; Xiong, Chenxi; Chen, Yao; Jiang, Shihui; Nguyen, Chi Mai; Song, Qianqian; Li, Xiaochun; Zhang, Pengyue; Eadon, Michael T; Su, Jing",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Humans; Acidosis; United States; Case-Control Studies; Female; Retrospective Studies; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Social Determinants of Health; Risk Factors; Health Status Disparities; Electronic Health Records; Logistic Models; Socioeconomic Factors; Aged; Propensity Score; Young Adult; Adolescent,All of Us; acidosis; electronic health records; health inequities; social determinants of health,"Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States.; Department of Computer and Information Technology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, United States.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States.; Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32608, United States.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States.; Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States.",10.1093/jamia/ocae256

All of Us,39953795,Association of migraine treatments with reduced ischemic stroke risk: Evidence from two large-scale real-world data analyses.,"To compare the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with migraine treated with first-line medications, including valproate, topiramate, metoprolol, timolol, or propranolol, versus those not receiving these treatments, using data from two large electronic health records datasets. The impact of first-line migraine medications on ischemic stroke risk in patients with migraine remains uncertain, highlighting the need for further investigation. We conducted a retrospective case-control study using data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and the All of Us Research Program. Cases were patients with a primary ischemic stroke diagnosis after their first migraine diagnosis, while controls had no ischemic stroke following their initial migraine diagnosis. In the VUMC database, 356 cases and 15,231 controls were identified; the All of Us database included 256 cases and 6590 controls. Propranolol was the only medication significantly associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke in female patients with migraine (VUMC: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33-0.86, p = 0.013; All of Us: aOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.77, p = 0.010), particularly in those with migraine without aura (VUMC: aOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.90, p = 0.027; All of Us: aOR 0.28, 95% CI 0.10-0.62, p = 0.006). The Cox model showed lower ischemic stroke rates in propranolol-treated female patients with migraine at 10 years in the VUMC data (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.45, 95% CI 0.24-0.83; p = 0.011, log-rank p < 0.001) and 10 years in the All of Us data (aHR 0.29, 95% CI 0.09-0.87; p = 0.048, log-rank p = 0.003). Among various migraine treatments, propranolol was notably associated with a significant reduction in ischemic stroke risk among female patients with migraine, particularly those without aura. These findings suggest a potential dual benefit of propranolol in managing migraine and reducing stroke risk, highlighting the need for further prospective studies to confirm these results and potentially inform clinical practice.","Jeong, Eugene; Mogos, Mulubrhan F; Chen, You",Headache,2025,"Humans; Female; Migraine Disorders; Ischemic Stroke; Retrospective Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Case-Control Studies; Adult; Propranolol; Databases, Factual; Topiramate; Valproic Acid; Aged; Metoprolol; Timolol; Electronic Health Records",electronic health records; ischemic stroke; migraine; migraine treatments; propranolol,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; School of Nursing, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Computer Science, School of Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.",10.1111/head.14918

To determine cost-related barriers to medication adherence by race and ethnicity in a nationwide cohort of patients with glaucoma. This cross-sectional study included patients with glaucoma enrolled in the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program, a nationwide longitudinal cohort of US adults, with more than 300 000 currently enrolled. Individuals with a diagnosis of glaucoma based on electronic health record diagnosis codes who participated in the Health Care Access and Utilization survey and had complete data on all covariates were studied. Data were collected from June 2016 to March 2021, and data were analyzed from August to November 2021. Race and ethnicity defined as non-Hispanic African American, non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between reported cost-related barriers to medication adherence (could not afford prescription medication, skipped medication doses to save money, took less medication to save money, delayed filling a prescription to save money, asked for lower-cost medication to save money, bought prescriptions from another country to save money, and used alternative therapies to save money) and race and ethnicity, adjusting multivariable models by age, gender, health insurance status, education, and income. Odds ratios of these barriers were obtained by race and ethnicity, with non-Hispanic White race as the reference group. Of 3826 included patients with glaucoma, 481 (12.6%) were African American, 119 (3.1%) were non-Hispanic Asian, 351 (9.2%) were Hispanic, and 2875 (75.1%) were non-Hispanic White. The median (IQR) age was 69 (60-75) years, and 2307 (60.3%) were female. After adjusting for confounders, non-Hispanic African American individuals (odds ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.34-2.44) and Hispanic individuals (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.25-2.49) were more likely than non-Hispanic White individuals to report not being able to afford medications. Further, despite having the lowest rate of endorsing difficulty affording medications, non-Hispanic White individuals were equally likely to ask for lower-cost medication from their clinicians as individuals of racial and ethnic minority groups. In this study, there was significantly higher odds of self-reported difficulty affording medications among non-Hispanic African American and Hispanic individuals compared with non-Hispanic White individuals. Clinicians should be proactive and initiate discussions about costs in an effort to promote medication adherence and health equity among patients.","Delavar, Arash; Radha Saseendrakumar, Bharanidharan; Weinreb, Robert N; Baxter, Sally L",JAMA ophthalmology,2022,Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnicity; Female; Glaucoma; Humans; Male; Medication Adherence; Minority Groups; National Institutes of Health (U.S.); Population Health; United States,,"Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.",10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2022.0055
All of Us,40163093,EHR-Based Risk Prediction for Kidney Cancer.,"The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not currently recommend routine screening for kidney cancer, even though approximately 14 390 people are expected to die from this disease in the United States in 2024. Individualized risk-based kidney cancer screening offers the potential to effectively detect cancer at an early stage and avoid unnecessarily screening the rest of the population who are at low risk. This study proposes electronic health records (EHR) risk evaluation for kidney cancer by examining a comprehensive set of medical history including diagnoses, comorbidities, viruses, and rare diseases. The relevant medical history for predicting kidney cancer occurrence was identified from the analysis of All of Us data in three steps. First, a Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) code binary indicator variable in EHR was set for the presence of kidney cancer. Second, the relationship between this binary indicator of cancer and all prior health conditions was examined using the Strong Rule for Feature Elimination and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator logistic regression methods of variable selection. Third, the accuracy of the model was reported using cross-validated McFadden's R2 and Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AROC) values. The analysis identified 133 out of an initial set of 25 683 clinical diagnoses (represented by SNOMED codes) that were predictive of kidney cancer. The model achieved a cross-validated McFadden's R2 of 0.195 and an AROC of 0.799. Most of the identified codes are consistent with the known risk factors for kidney cancer. It is possible to accurately predict the risk of kidney cancer from medical history using this method. Additional studies to establish high-dimensional predictive risk factors are needed to see if EHR personalized risk prediction can lead to cost-effective cancer screening and eventually better clinical outcomes.","Lee, Kyung Hee; Alemi, Farrokh; Wang, Xia",Quality management in health care,2025,Humans; Electronic Health Records; Kidney Neoplasms; Risk Assessment; Male; Female; United States; Risk Factors; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; Middle Aged; Aged; ROC Curve; Early Detection of Cancer,cancer prediction modeling; electronic health records; high-dimensional predictive risk factors; kidney cancer,"Author Affiliations: Department of Recreation, Parks and Leisure Services Administration, Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, MI (Dr Lee); Health Informatics, Health Administration and Policy, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia (Dr Alemi); and Internal Medicine, Central Michigan University Medical Education Partners, Saginaw, Michigan (Dr Wang).",10.1097/QMH.0000000000000526
All of Us,40169705,Effects of smoking behavior on lung metastasis in the All of Us Research Program.,"Smoking may be associated with an increased risk of lung metastasis in cancers of non-lung origin. We leverage survey and electronic health record data from the diverse All of Us Research Program (AoURP) database to investigate whether smoking and smoking-related behaviors increase the risk of lung metastasis in non-lung primary cancers. The results suggest that cigarette use, measured by four continuous variables, does not increase the risk of lung metastasis in seven common cancer types but demonstrates a small significant effect in a cohort including all types of cancer in the database in both univariable and multivariable analyses. An increased odds ratio of electronic smoke use in patients with lung metastasis was seen in multivariable analyses of the all cancer (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.04-1.59, P = 0.02) and liver cancer (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.06-2.28, P = 0.02) groups. After adjusting for estimated cigarette pack years in the multivariable model, the result remained significant for liver cancer (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.02-2.47, P = 0.04) but not the all cancer cohort. These results warrant further inquiry and suggest that smoking and e-cigarettes may be associated with lung metastasis risk in patients with non-lung tumors.","Shaw, Vikram R; Byun, Jinyoung; Han, Younghun; Amos, Christopher I",Scientific reports,2025,Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Female; Male; Middle Aged; United States; Smoking; Aged; Risk Factors; Adult; Liver Neoplasms; Neoplasm Metastasis,,"Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.; Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.; Section of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.; University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA.; Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.; Section of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.; University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA.; Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. ciamos@salud.unm.edu.; Section of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. ciamos@salud.unm.edu.; University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA. ciamos@salud.unm.edu.",10.1038/s41598-025-89209-4
All of Us,34431358,Cardiovascular Health Disparities in Racial and Other Underrepresented Groups: Initial Results From the All of Us Research Program.,"Background All of Us is a novel research program that aims to accelerate research in populations traditionally underrepresented in biomedical research. Our objective was to evaluate the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in broadly defined underrepresented groups. Methods and Results We evaluated the latest data release of All of Us. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis combining survey and electronic health record data to estimate the prevalence of CVD upon enrollment in underrepresented groups defined by race, ethnicity, age (>75 years), disability (not able to carry out everyday physical activities), sexual orientation and gender identity lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA+), income (annual household income <$35 000 US dollars) and education (less than a high school degree). We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and product terms to test for interaction. The latest All of Us data release includes 315 297 participants. Of these, 230 577 (73%) had information on CVD and 17 958 had CVD (overall prevalence, 7.8%; 95% CI, 7.7-7.9). Multivariate analyses adjusted by hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, body mass index, and smoking indicated that, compared with White participants, Black participants had a higher adjusted odds of CVD (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.16-1.27). Higher adjusted odds of CVD were also observed in underrepresented groups defined by other factors, including age >75 years (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.81-1.99), disability (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.53-1.68), and income <$35 000 US dollars (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.17-1.27). Sex significantly modified the odds of CVD in several of the evaluated groups. Conclusions Among participants enrolled in All of Us, underrepresented groups defined based on race, ethnicity and other factors have a disproportionately high burden of CVD. The All of Us research program constitutes a powerful platform to accelerate research focused on individuals in underrepresented groups.","Acosta, Julián N; Leasure, Audrey C; Both, Cameron P; Szejko, Natalia; Brown, Stacy; Torres-Lopez, Victor; Abdelhakim, Safa; Schindler, Joseph; Petersen, Nils; Sansing, Lauren; Gill, Thomas M; Sheth, Kevin N; Falcone, Guido J",Journal of the American Heart Association,2021,Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnicity; Female; Gender Identity; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; Population Health; Racial Groups; Risk Factors; United States,All of Us; cardiovascular disease; disparities research; myocardial infarction; stroke,Department of Neurology Yale School of Medicine New Haven CT.; Department of Neurology Yale School of Medicine New Haven CT.; Department of Neurology Yale School of Medicine New Haven CT.; Department of Neurology Yale School of Medicine New Haven CT.; John A.

All of Us,39003521,Model-based estimation of individual-level social determinants of health and its applications in All of Us.,"We introduce a widely applicable model-based approach for estimating individual-level Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and evaluate its effectiveness using the All of Us Research Program. Our approach utilizes aggregated SDoH datasets to estimate individual-level SDoH, demonstrated with examples of no high school diploma (NOHSDP) and no health insurance (UNINSUR) variables. Models are estimated using American Community Survey data and applied to derive individual-level estimates for All of Us participants. We assess concordance between model-based SDoH estimates and self-reported SDoHs in All of Us and examine associations with undiagnosed hypertension and diabetes. Compared to self-reported SDoHs, the area under the curve for NOHSDP is 0.727 (95% CI, 0.724-0.730) and for UNINSUR is 0.730 (95% CI, 0.727-0.733) among the 329 074 All of Us participants, both significantly higher than aggregated SDoHs. The association between model-based NOHSDP and undiagnosed hypertension is concordant with those estimated using self-reported NOHSDP, with a correlation coefficient of 0.649. Similarly, the association between model-based NOHSDP and undiagnosed diabetes is concordant with those estimated using self-reported NOHSDP, with a correlation coefficient of 0.900. The model-based SDoH estimation method offers a scalable and easily standardized approach for estimating individual-level SDoHs. Using the All of Us dataset, we demonstrate reasonable concordance between model-based SDoH estimates and self-reported SDoHs, along with consistent associations with health outcomes. Our findings also underscore the critical role of geographic contexts in SDoH estimation and in evaluating the association between SDoHs and health outcomes.","Kim, Bo Young; Anthopolos, Rebecca; Do, Hyungrok; Zhong, Judy",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,"Humans; Social Determinants of Health; United States; Male; Female; Adult; Middle Aged; Diabetes Mellitus; Models, Statistical; Hypertension; Self Report; Aged",All of Us; Social Determinant of Health (SDoH); electronic health records (EHRs); individual-level SDoH; model-based estimation,"Division of Biostatistics, Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, United States.; Division of Biostatistics, Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, United States.; Division of Biostatistics, Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, United States.; Division of Biostatistics, Department of Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, United States.",10.1093/jamia/ocae168
All of Us,38622899,Illuminating the landscape of high-level clinical trial opportunities in the All of Us Research Program.,"With its size and diversity, the All of Us Research Program has the potential to power and improve representation in clinical trials through ancillary studies like Nutrition for Precision Health. We sought to characterize high-level trial opportunities for the diverse participants and sponsors of future trial investment. We matched All of Us participants with available trials on ClinicalTrials.gov based on medical conditions, age, sex, and geographic location. Based on the number of matched trials, we (1) developed the Trial Opportunities Compass (TOC) to help sponsors assess trial investment portfolios, (2) characterized the landscape of trial opportunities in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), and (3) assessed the relationship between trial opportunities and social determinants of health (SDoH) to identify potential barriers to trial participation. Our study included 181 529 All of Us participants and 18 634 trials. The TOC identified opportunities for portfolio investment and gaps in currently available trials across federal, industrial, and academic sponsors. PheWAS results revealed an emphasis on mental disorder-related trials, with anxiety disorder having the highest adjusted increase in the number of matched trials (59% [95% CI, 57-62]; P < 1e-300).

We used data from the National Institutes of Health's All of Us Research Program, an ongoing nationwide study of more than 300,000 diverse individuals in the United States. Height and weight were measured at baseline, and participants completed questionnaires about demographics, health care access, and quality of life. Women aged 18-50 years with IIH were identified through electronic health record data, excluding those with venous thrombosis, meningitis, hydrocephalus, or central nervous system neoplasms. We used logistic regression to compare questionnaire responses for IIH cases and controls, adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, annual income, and body mass index (BMI). We included 416 women with IIH and 107,111 women without IIH. The mean age was 38 years, and 49.3% identified as non-White. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and BMI, women with IIH were more likely to be unemployed (odds ratio [OR] 1.40, 95% confidential interval [CI]: 1.14-1.71) and report delaying care because of difficulty affording copays (OR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.02-2.10) or specialist care (OR 1.52, 95% CI: 1.06-2.18). They also delayed care because of rural residence (OR 2.08, 95% CI: 1.25-3.47) and transportation limitations (OR 2.23, 95% CI: 1.55-3.20). Although women with IIH were more likely to be non-Hispanic Black (OR 1.66, 95% CI: 1.32-2.09), this association lost significance when controlling for BMI and income (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 0.96-1.68).

All of Us,27028435,Opportunities for the Cardiovascular Community in the Precision Medicine Initiative.,"The Precision Medicine Initiative recently announced by President Barack Obama seeks to move the field of precision medicine more rapidly into clinical care. Precision medicine revolves around the concept of integrating individual-level data including genomics, biomarkers, lifestyle and other environmental factors, wearable device physiological data, and information from electronic health records to ultimately provide better clinical care to individual patients. The Precision Medicine Initiative as currently structured will primarily fund efforts in cancer genomics with longer-term goals of advancing precision medicine to all areas of health, and will be supported through creation of a 1 million person cohort study across the United States. This focused effort on precision medicine provides scientists, clinicians, and patients within the cardiovascular community an opportunity to work together boldly to advance clinical care; the community needs to be aware and engaged in the process as it progresses. This article provides a framework for potential involvement of the cardiovascular community in the Precision Medicine Initiative, while highlighting significant challenges for its successful implementation.","Shah, Svati H;

All of Us,27435944,Implementing partnership-driven clinical federated electronic health record data sharing networks.,"Building federated data sharing architectures requires supporting a range of data owners, effective and validated semantic alignment between data resources, and consistent focus on end-users. Establishing these resources requires development methodologies that support internal validation of data extraction and translation processes, sustaining meaningful partnerships, and delivering clear and measurable system utility. We describe findings from two federated data sharing case examples that detail critical factors, shared outcomes, and production environment results. Two federated data sharing pilot architectures developed to support network-based research associated with the University of Washington's Institute of Translational Health Sciences provided the basis for the findings. A spiral model for implementation and evaluation was used to structure iterations of development and support knowledge share between the two network development teams, which cross collaborated to support and manage common stages. We found that using a spiral model of software development and multiple cycles of iteration was effective in achieving early network design goals. Both networks required time and resource intensive efforts to establish a trusted environment to create the data sharing architectures. Both networks were challenged by the need for adaptive use cases to define and test utility. An iterative cyclical model of development provided a process for developing trust with data partners and refining the design, and supported measureable success in the development of new federated data sharing architectures.","Stephens, Kari A; Anderson, Nicholas; Lin, Ching-Ping; Estiri, Hossein",International journal of medical informatics,2016,"Computer Communication Networks; Cooperative Behavior; Databases as Topic; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Dissemination; Information Storage and Retrieval; Models, Organizational; Software; United States; User-Computer Interface",Data sharing; Electronic health records; Federated networks; Implementation; Information systems,"Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington, Box 356560, Seattle, WA 98195, United States; Department of Biomedical Informatics & Medical Education, University of Washington, Box 358051, Seattle, WA 98109, United States; Institute of Translational Health Sciences, University of Washington, Box 358051, Seattle, WA 98109, United States.

All of Us,33444781,Dissemination of a telehealth cardiovascular risk service: The CVRS live protocol.,"Medical clinics are increasingly hiring clinical pharmacists to improve management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the limited number of clinical pharmacists employed in a clinic may not impact the large number of complex patients needing the services. We have developed a remote telehealth service provided by clinical pharmacists to complement CVD services provided by on-site clinical pharmacists and aid sites without a clinical pharmacist. This cardiovascular risk service (CVRS) has been studied in two NIH-funded trials, however, we identified barriers to optimal intervention implementation. The purpose of this study is to examine how to implement the CVRS into medical offices and see if the intervention will be sustained. This is a 5-year, pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial in 13 primary care clinics across the US. We randomized clinics to receive CVRS or usual care and will enroll 325 patient subjects and 288 key stakeholder subjects. We have obtained access to the electronic medical records (EMRs) of all study clinics to recruit subjects and provide the pharmacist intervention. The intervention is staggered so that after 12 months, the usual care sites will receive the intervention for 12 months. Follow-up will be accomplished though medical record abstraction at baseline, 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months. This study will enroll subjects through 2021 and results will be available in 2024. This study will provide unique information on how the CVRS provided by remote clinical pharmacists can be effectively implemented in medical offices, many of which already employ on-site clinical pharmacists.

We sought to replicate these differences and evaluate newly emerging data from the All of Us Research Program (AoU). We compared body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio from the baseline physical examination, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) from the electronic health record in up to 88,195 Non-Hispanic White (NHW), 40,770 Non-Hispanic Black (NHB), 35,640 Hispanic, and 5,648 Asian participants. We compared AoU sociodemographic variable distribution to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data and applied the pseudo-weighting method for adjusting selection biases of AoU recruitment. Our findings replicate previous observations with respect to gender differences in BMI. In particular, we replicate the large gender disparity in obesity rates among NHB participants, in which obesity and mean BMI are much higher in NHB women than NHB men (33.34 kg/m2 versus 28.40 kg/m2 respectively; p<2.22x10-308). The overall age-adjusted obesity prevalence in AoU participants is similar overall but lower than the prevalence found in NHANES for NHW participants. ALT was higher in men than women, and lower among NHB participants compared to other racial/ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings.

Despite this difficulty, the urgent public health considerations around Long COVID make it especially important to ensure the rigor and reproducibility of Long COVID phenotyping algorithms such that they can be made available to a broad audience of researchers. As part of the NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, researchers with the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) devised and trained an ML-based phenotype to identify patients highly probable to have Long COVID. Supported by RECOVER, N3C and NIH's All of Us study partnered to reproduce the output of N3C's trained model in the All of Us data enclave, demonstrating model extensibility in multiple environments.

From the All of Us research database, we identified 21,687 adult participants with both patient-reported and EHR data. We compared differences in age, sex, race, education, employment status and healthcare access between patients with self-reported kidney stone history without EHR data to those with EHR-based diagnoses. In this population, the self-reported prevalence of kidney stones was 8.6% overall (n = 1877), including 4.6% (n = 1004) who had self-reported diagnoses but no EHR data. Among those with self-reported kidney stone diagnoses only, the median age was 66. The EHR-based prevalence of kidney stones was 5.7% (n = 1231), median age 67. No differences were observed in age, sex, education, employment status, rural/urban status, or ability to afford healthcare between groups with EHR diagnosis or self-reported diagnosis only. Of patients who had a self-reported history of kidney stones, 24% reported actively seeing a provider for kidney stones. Kidney stone prevalence by self-report is higher than EHR-based prevalence in this national dataset. Using either method alone to estimate kidney stone prevalence may exclude some patients with the condition, although the demographic profile of both groups is similar. Approximately 1 in 4 patients report actively seeing a provider for stone disease.","Forbes, Connor M; Nimmagadda, Naren; Kavoussi, Nicholas L; Xu, Yaomin; Bejan, Cosmin A; Miller, Nicole L; Hsi, Ryan S",Urology,2023,Humans; Kidney Calculi; Male; Female; Adult; Middle Aged; Aged; Electronic Health Records; Prevalence; Population Health,,"Department of Urology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; Department of Urologic Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

We applied a regularized logistic regression model and predicted 30-day readmission risk for 1210 unique patients. Our validation cohort resulted in a C-statistic of 0.84. Our top predictors of readmission were prior diagnosis of heart failure, vascular and renal diseases, and malnutrition as comorbidities, compliance with outpatient follow-up, and low socioeconomic status. This validated risk prediction scheme delivered better performance than the published models so far (C-Statistics: 0.69). It can be used to stratify patients for readmission and to aid clinicians in delivering precise health interventions.","Mahajan, Satish M; Burman, Prabir; Newton, Ana; Heidenreich, Paul A",Studies in health technology and informatics,2017,Electronic Health Records; Heart Failure; Humans; Logistic Models; Patient Readmission; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors,Heart Failure; Models; Patient Readmission; Theoretical,"Veterans Health Administration, Palo Alto, California, USA.; Department of Statistics, University of California Davis, Davis, California, USA.; College of Public Health, University of San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.; Veterans Health Administration, Palo Alto, California, USA.",

Understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection risk after vaccination among PWH is essential for informing vaccination guidelines. To estimate the rate and risk of breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated PWH and people without HIV (PWoH) in the United States. This cohort study used the Corona-Infectious-Virus Epidemiology Team (CIVET)-II (of the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design [NA-ACCORD], which is part of the International Epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS [IeDEA]), collaboration of 4 prospective, electronic health record-based cohorts from integrated health systems and academic health centers. Adult PWH who were fully vaccinated prior to June 30, 2021, were matched with PWoH on date of full vaccination, age, race and ethnicity, and sex and followed up through December 31, 2021. HIV infection. COVID-19 breakthrough infections, defined as laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 diagnosis after a patient was fully vaccinated. Among 113 994 patients (33 029 PWH and 80 965 PWoH), most were 55 years or older (80 017 [70%]) and male (104 967 [92%]); 47 098 (41%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 43 218 (38%) were non-Hispanic White. The rate of breakthrough infections was higher in PWH vs PWoH (55 [95% CI, 52-58] cases per 1000 person-years vs 43 [95% CI, 42-45] cases per 1000 person-years). Cumulative incidence of breakthroughs 9 months after full vaccination was low (3.8% [95% CI, 3.7%-3.9%]), albeit higher in PWH vs PWoH (4.4% vs 3.5%; log-rank P < .001; risk difference, 0.9% [95% CI, 0.6%-1.2%]) and within each vaccine type. Breakthrough infection risk was 28% higher in PWH vs PWoH (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.19-1.37]). Among PWH, younger age (<45 y vs 45-54 y), history of COVID-19, and not receiving an additional dose (aHR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.58-0.88]) were associated with increased risk of breakthrough infections. There was no association of breakthrough with HIV viral load suppression, but high CD4 count (ie, ≥500 cells/mm3) was associated with fewer breakthroughs among PWH. In this study, COVID-19 vaccination, especially with an additional dose, was effective against infection with SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating through December 31, 2021. PWH had an increased risk of breakthrough infections compared with PWoH. Expansion of recommendations for additional vaccine doses to all PWH should be considered.","Coburn, Sally B; Humes, Elizabeth; Lang, Raynell; Stewart, Cameron; Hogan, Brenna C; Gebo, Kelly A; Napravnik, Sonia; Edwards, Jessie K; Browne, Lindsay E; Park, Lesley S; Justice, Amy C; Gordon, Kirsha S; Horberg, Michael A; Certa, Julia M; Watson, Eric; Jefferson, Celeena R; Silverberg, Michael J; Skarbinski, Jacek; Leyden, Wendy A; Williams, Carolyn F; Althoff, Keri N",JAMA network open,2022,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Adult; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cohort Studies; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Prospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; United States,,"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland.; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland.; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland.; Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland.; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland.; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland.; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.; Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.; Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.; Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.; Stanford Center for Population Health Sciences, Palo Alto, California.; Department of Health Policy and Management, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven.; Department of Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven.; Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States, Mid-Atlantic Permanente Research Institute, Rockville, Maryland.; Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States, Mid-Atlantic Permanente Research Institute, Rockville, Maryland.; Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States, Mid-Atlantic Permanente Research Institute, Rockville, Maryland.; Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States, Mid-Atlantic Permanente Research Institute, Rockville, Maryland.; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland.; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Oakland Medical Center, Oakland, California.; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland.; Epidemiology Branch, Division of AIDS at National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland.; Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.15934

PheWAS is an analysis method to study phenotype associations utilizing longitudinal EHR data. Previous PheWAS packages were developed mostly with smaller datasets and with earlier PheWAS approaches. PheTK was designed to simplify analysis and efficiently handle biobank-scale data. PheTK uses multithreading and supports a full PheWAS workflow including extraction of data from OMOP databases and Hail matrix tables as well as PheWAS analysis for both phecode version 1.2 and phecodeX. Benchmarking results showed PheTK took 64% less time than the R PheWAS package to complete the same workflow. PheTK can be run locally or on cloud platforms such as the All of Us Researcher Workbench (All of Us) or the UK Biobank (UKB) Research Analysis Platform (RAP). The PheTK package is freely available on the Python Package Index, on GitHub under GNU General Public License (GPL-3) at https://github.com/nhgritctran/PheTK, and on Zenodo, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14217954, at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14217954.

All of Us,35590255,Psychiatric manifestations of rare variation in medically actionable genes: a PheWAS approach.,"As genomic sequencing moves closer to clinical implementation, there has been an increasing acceptance of returning incidental findings to research participants and patients for mutations in highly penetrant, medically actionable genes. A curated list of genes has been recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) for return of incidental findings. However, the pleiotropic effects of these genes are not fully known. Such effects could complicate genetic counseling when returning incidental findings. In particular, there has been no systematic evaluation of psychiatric manifestations associated with rare variation in these genes. Here, we leveraged a targeted sequence panel and real-world electronic health records from the eMERGE network to assess the burden of rare variation in the ACMG-56 genes and two psychiatric-associated genes (CACNA1C  and TCF4) across common mental health conditions in 15,181 individuals of European descent. As a positive control, we showed that this approach replicated the established association between rare mutations in LDLR and hypercholesterolemia with no visible inflation from population stratification. However, we did not identify any genes significantly enriched with rare deleterious variants that confer risk for common psychiatric disorders after correction for multiple testing. Suggestive associations were observed between depression and rare coding variation in PTEN (P = 1.5 × 10 Our results do not support an association between psychiatric disorders and incidental findings in medically actionable gene mutations, but power was limited with the available sample sizes. Given the phenotypic and genetic complexity of psychiatric phenotypes, future work will require a much larger sequencing dataset to determine whether incidental findings in these genes have implications for risk of psychopathology.","Feng, Yen-Chen A; Stanaway, Ian B; Connolly, John J; Denny, Joshua C; Luo, Yuan; Weng, Chunhua; Wei, Wei-Qi; Weiss, Scott T; Karlson, Elizabeth W; Smoller, Jordan W",BMC genomics,2022,Exome; Genetic Testing; Genetic Variation; Genomics; Humans; Mutation; Phenotype,Genomic sequencing; Incidental findings; Psychiatric disorders; Rare variation,"Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. yef314@mail.harvard.edu.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, 415 Main Street, Cambridge, MA, USA. yef314@mail.harvard.edu.; Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. yef314@mail.harvard.edu.; Master of Public Health Program, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. yef314@mail.harvard.edu.; Division of Nephrology, School of Medicine, Kidney Research Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.; Center for Applied Genomics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; All of Us Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Besthesda, MD, USA.; Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Inflammation and Immunity, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. jsmoller@mgh.harvard.edu.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, 415 Main Street, Cambridge, MA, USA. jsmoller@mgh.harvard.edu.; Center for Precision Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. jsmoller@mgh.harvard.edu.",10.1186/s12864-022-08600-x
All of Us,35157022,Cox regression is robust to inaccurate EHR-extracted event time: an application to EHR-based GWAS.,"Logistic regression models are used in genomic studies to analyze the genetic data linked to electronic health records (EHRs), and do not take full usage of the time-to-event information available in EHRs. Previous work has shown that Cox regression, which can account for left truncation and right censoring in EHRs, increased the power to detect genotype-phenotype associations compared to logistic regression. We extend this to evaluate the relative performance of Cox regression and various logistic regression models in the presence of positive errors in event time (delayed event time), relating to recorded event time accuracy. One Cox model and three logistic regression models were considered under different scenarios of delayed event time. Extensive simulations and a genomic study application were used to evaluate the impact of delayed event time. While logistic regression does not model the time-to-event directly, various logistic regression models used in the literature were more sensitive to delayed event time than Cox regression. Results highlighted the importance to identify and exclude the patients diagnosed before entry time. Cox regression had similar or modest improvement in statistical power over various logistic regression models at controlled type I error. This was supported by the empirical data, where the Cox models steadily had the highest sensitivity to detect known genotype-phenotype associations under all scenarios of delayed event time.

This study aims to determine the clinical impact of a systematic risk assessment in diverse primary care populations. Hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial of a family health history-based health risk assessment (HRA) tied to risk-based guideline recommendations enrolling from 2014-2017 with 12 months of post-intervention survey data and 24 months of electronic medical record (EMR) data capture. 19 primary care clinics at four geographically and culturally diverse U.S. healthcare systems. any English or Spanish-speaking adult with an upcoming appointment at an enrolling clinic. A personal and family health history based HRA with integrated guideline-based clinical decision support (CDS) was completed by each participant prior to their appointment. Risk reports were provided to patients and providers to discuss at their clinical encounter. provider and patient discussion and provider uptake (i.e. ordering) and patient uptake (i.e. recommendation completion) of CDS recommendations. patient and provider surveys and EMR data. One thousand eight hundred twenty nine participants (mean age 56.2 [SD13.9], 69.6% female) completed the HRA and had EMR data available for analysis. 762 (41.6%) received a recommendation (29.7% for genetic counseling (GC); 15.2% for enhanced breast/colon cancer screening). Those with recommendations frequently discussed disease risk with their provider (8.7%-38.2% varied by recommendation, p-values ≤ 0.004). In the GC subgroup, provider discussions increased referrals to counseling (44.4% with vs. 5.9% without, P < 0.001). Recommendation uptake was highest for colon cancer screening (provider = 67.9%; patient = 86.8%) and lowest for breast cancer chemoprevention (0%). Systematic health risk assessment revealed that almost half the population were at increased disease risk based on guidelines. Risk identification resulted in shared discussions between participants and providers but variable clinical action uptake depending upon the recommendation. Understanding the barriers and facilitators to uptake by both patients and providers will be essential for optimizing HRA tools and achieving their promise of improving population health.

The diversity and size of AoU's data network result in multifaceted obstacles to data integration that may undermine the usability of patient EHR. Consequently, the AoU team implemented data quality tools to regularly evaluate and communicate EHR data quality issues at scale. The use of systematic feedback and educational tools ultimately increased site engagement and led to quantitative improvements in EHR quality as measured by program- and externally-defined metrics. These improvements enabled the AoU team to save time on troubleshooting EHR and focus on the development of alternate mechanisms to improve the quality of future EHR submissions. While this framework has proven effective, further efforts to automate and centralize communication channels are needed to deepen the program's efforts while retaining its scalability.","Engel, Noah; Wang, Hongjue; Jiang, Xinzhuo; Lau, Chun Yee; Patterson, Jason; Acharya, Nripendra; Beaton, Maura; Sulieman, Lina; Pavinkurve, Nishanth; Natarajan, Karthik",AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

All of Us,38015485,The descriptive epidemiology of melanoma in Italy has changed - for the better.,"A recent research project using data from a total of 40 cancer registries has provided new epidemiologic insights into the results of efforts for melanoma control in Italy between the 1990s and the last decade. In this article, the authors present a summary and a commentary of their findings. Incidence increased significantly throughout the study period in both sexes. However, the rates showed a stabilization or a decrease in men and women aged below 35 years. The risk of disease increased for successive cohorts born until 1973 (women) and 1975 (men) while subsequently tending to decline. The trend towards decreasing tumor thickness and increasing survival has continued, but a novel favorable prognostic factor has emerged since 2013 for patients - particularly for males - with thick melanoma, most likely represented by molecular targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Due to this, the survival gap between males and females has been filled out. In the meanwhile, and despite the incidence increase, dermatologists have not lowered their threshold to perform skin biopsy. Skin biopsy rate has increased because of the increasingly greater volume of dermatologic office visits, but the proportion of skin biopsies out of dermatologic office visits has remained constant. In summary, an important breakthrough in melanoma control in Italy has taken place. Effective interventions have been implemented across the full scope of care, which involve many large local populations - virtually the whole national population. The strategies adopted during the last three decades represent a valuable basis for further steps ahead in melanoma control in Italy.","Bucchi, Lauro; Mancini, Silvia; Crocetti, Emanuele; Dal Maso, Luigino;

All of Us,37860921,Participant-guided development of bilingual genomic educational infographics for Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Phase IV study.,"Developing targeted, culturally competent educational materials is critical for participant understanding of engagement in a large genomic study that uses computational pipelines to produce genome-informed risk assessments. Guided by the Smerecnik framework that theorizes understanding of multifactorial genetic disease through 3 knowledge types, we developed English and Spanish infographics for individuals enrolled in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network. Infographics were developed to explain concepts in lay language and visualizations. We conducted iterative sessions using a modified ""think-aloud"" process with 10 participants (6 English, 4 Spanish-speaking) to explore comprehension of and attitudes towards the infographics. We found that all but one participant had ""awareness knowledge"" of genetic disease risk factors upon viewing the infographics. Many participants had difficulty with ""how-to"" knowledge of applying genetic risk factors to specific monogenic and polygenic risks. Participant attitudes towards the iteratively-refined infographics indicated that design saturation was reached. There were several elements that contributed to the participants' comprehension (or misunderstanding) of the infographics. Visualization and iconography techniques best resonated with those who could draw on prior experiences or knowledge and were absent in those without.

The experiences of patients and physicians in routine clinical practice are often different from those in a controlled clinical trial setting. We present data from the entire Italian cohort of patients with squamous NSCLC enrolled in a worldwide nivolumab NSCLC expanded access program. Patients with pretreated advanced squamous NSCLC received nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for up to 24 months. Safety was monitored throughout; efficacy data collected included objective tumor response, date of progression, and survival information. The Italian cohort comprised 371 patients who received at least one dose of nivolumab. In the overall population, the objective response rate (ORR) was 18%, the disease control rate (DCR) was 47%, and median overall survival (OS) was 7.9 months (95% confidence interval 6.2-9.6). In subgroup analyses, ORR, DCR, and median OS were, respectively, 17%, 48%, and 9.1 months in patients previously treated with two or more lines of therapy ( To date, this report represents the most extensive clinical experience with nivolumab in advanced squamous NSCLC in current practice outside the controlled clinical trial setting. These data suggest that the efficacy and safety profiles of nivolumab in a broad, real-world setting are consistent with those obtained in clinical trials. Nivolumab is approved in the U.S. and Europe for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy. In this cohort of Italian patients with previously treated, advanced squamous NSCLC treated in a real-world setting as part of the nivolumab expanded access program, the efficacy and safety of nivolumab was consistent with that previously reported in nivolumab clinical trials.","Crinò, Lucio; Bidoli, Paolo; Delmonte, Angelo; Grossi, Francesco; De Marinis, Filippo; Ardizzoni, Andrea; Vitiello, Fabiana; Lo Russo, Giuseppe; Parra, Hector Soto; Cortesi, Enrico; Cappuzzo, Federico; Calabrò, Luana; Tiseo, Marcello; Turci, Daniele; Gamucci, Teresa; Antonelli, Paola; Morabito, Alessandro; Chella, Antonio; Giannarelli, Diana; Galetta, Domenico",The oncologist,2019,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cohort Studies; Compassionate Use Trials; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Humans; Immunotherapy; Italy; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Nivolumab; Safety; Treatment Outcome",Expanded access program; Immunotherapy; Nivolumab; Real‐world; Squamous non‐small cell lung cancer; Treatment beyond disease progression,"Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy lucio.crino@irst.emr.it.; Department of Oncology, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST) Monza, Presidio San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.; Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.; Division of Medical Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Cà Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.; Department of Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milano, Italy.; Medical Oncology, Policlinico Sant'Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy.; Department of Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera (AO) dei Colli-Monaldi-Cotugno-Centro Traumatrico Ortopedico (CTO), Napoli, Italy.; Department of Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milano, Italy.; Department of Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria (AOU) Policlinico Vittorio Emanuele, Catania, Italy.; Department of Oncology, Policlinico Umberto I, Roma, Italy.; Department Azienda Unità Sanitaria Locale (AUSL), Romagna Viale Randi, Ravenna, Italy.; Medical Oncology and Immunotherapy, Center for Immuno-Oncology, University Hospital of Siena, Siena, Italy.; Medical Oncology Unit, University Hospital of Parma, Parma, Italy.; Department Azienda Unità Sanitaria Locale (AUSL), Romagna Viale Randi, Ravenna, Italy.; Medical Oncology Unit, Azienda Sanitaria Locale (ASL) Frosinone, Presidio Ospedaliero Servizi Sanitari (SS) Trinità, Sora (Frosinone), Italy.; Department of Oncology, Presidio Ospedaliero di Busto Arsizio, Busto Arsizio, Italy.; Thoracic Medical Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Fondazione G.

In addition, we highlight a gap in the use of diagnosis codes. The purpose of this study was to analyze patterns of diagnosis coding usage and validate epidemiologic patterns of glaucoma onset and severity among primary glaucoma patients within the National Institutes of Health All of Us database. We used International Classification of Disease diagnosis codes to build 4 cohorts of patients with mild, moderate, severe, and unspecified stage glaucoma (N=2982). Descriptive analyses were stratified by disease stage, and mean age at diagnosis was compared across racial and ethnic groups. Multivariable ordinal regression was used to examine risk factors for increasing glaucoma severity. Of 2982 participants, 1714 (57%) had unspecified severity staging. Black/African Americans and other races were diagnosed with glaucoma at significantly younger ages compared with Whites (means 60 and 60 vs. 66 y; P <0.001). Hispanic/Latino participants also had an earlier mean age of diagnosis (61 vs. 65 y; P =0.001). Black/African Americans had higher odds of more severe glaucoma (odds ratio: 2.20, 95% CI, 1.62-3.30; P <0.001) than Whites when adjusting for socioeconomic characteristics. Black, Hispanic/Latino, and other minority participants are diagnosed with glaucoma at younger ages, and Blacks are more likely to be diagnosed with moderate-to-severe glaucoma. These findings validate prior population-based studies. Furthermore, we observed a gap in the use of diagnosis codes, as only 43% of participants had a specified severity stage in this national cohort. This may have implications for large-scale observational research concerning glaucoma severity, as electronic health records and claims databases typically lack other measures of disease progression, such as imaging and visual field data.","Acuff, Kaela; Radha Saseendrakumar, Bharanidharan; Wu, Jo-Hsuan; Weinreb, Robert N; Baxter, Sally L",Journal of glaucoma,2023,Humans; United States; Socioeconomic Disparities in Health; Intraocular Pressure; Population Health; Racial Groups; Glaucoma,,"Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.",10.1097/IJG.0000000000002261

All of Us,30689846,Overview of the BioCreative VI Precision Medicine Track: mining protein interactions and mutations for precision medicine.,"The Precision Medicine Initiative is a multicenter effort aiming at formulating personalized treatments leveraging on individual patient data (clinical, genome sequence and functional genomic data) together with the information in large knowledge bases (KBs) that integrate genome annotation, disease association studies, electronic health records and other data types. The biomedical literature provides a rich foundation for populating these KBs, reporting genetic and molecular interactions that provide the scaffold for the cellular regulatory systems and detailing the influence of genetic variants in these interactions. The goal of BioCreative VI Precision Medicine Track was to extract this particular type of information and was organized in two tasks: (i) document triage task, focused on identifying scientific literature containing experimentally verified protein-protein interactions (PPIs) affected by genetic mutations and (ii) relation extraction task, focused on extracting the affected interactions (protein pairs). To assist system developers and task participants, a large-scale corpus of PubMed documents was manually annotated for this task. Ten teams worldwide contributed 22 distinct text-mining models for the document triage task, and six teams worldwide contributed 14 different text-mining systems for the relation extraction task. When comparing the text-mining system predictions with human annotations, for the triage task, the best F-score was 69.06%, the best precision was 62.89%, the best recall was 98.0% and the best average precision was 72.5%. For the relation extraction task, when taking homologous genes into account, the best F-score was 37.73%, the best precision was 46.5% and the best recall was 54.1%. Submitted systems explored a wide range of methods, from traditional rule-based, statistical and machine learning systems to state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Given the level of participation and the individual team results we find the precision medicine track to be successful in engaging the text-mining research community. In the meantime, the track produced a manually annotated corpus of 5509 PubMed documents developed by BioGRID curators and relevant for precision medicine. The data set is freely available to the community, and the specific interactions have been integrated into the BioGRID data set. In addition, this challenge provided the first results of automatically identifying PubMed articles that describe PPI affected by mutations, as well as extracting the affected relations from those articles. Still, much progress is needed for computer-assisted precision medicine text mining to become mainstream. Future work should focus on addressing the remaining technical challenges and incorporating the practical benefits of text-mining tools into real-world precision medicine information-related curation.","Islamaj Dogan, Rezarta; Kim, Sun; Chatr-Aryamontri, Andrew; Wei, Chih-Hsuan; Comeau, Donald C; Antunes, Rui; Matos, Sérgio; Chen, Qingyu; Elangovan, Aparna; Panyam, Nagesh C; Verspoor, Karin; Liu, Hongfang; Wang, Yanshan; Liu, Zhuang; Altinel, Berna; Hüsünbeyi, Zehra Melce; Özgür, Arzucan; Fergadis, Aris; Wang, Chen-Kai; Dai, Hong-Jie; Tran, Tung; Kavuluru, Ramakanth; Luo, Ling; Steppi, Albert; Zhang, Jinfeng; Qu, Jinchan; Lu, Zhiyong",Database : the journal of biological databases and curation,2019,"Computational Biology; Data Mining; Databases, Protein; Humans; Mutation; Precision Medicine; Protein Interaction Mapping; Protein Interaction Maps; Software",,"National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada.; National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics (DETI)/Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro (IEETA), University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.; Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics (DETI)/Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro (IEETA), University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.; School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.; Department of Health Science Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Department of Health Science Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; School of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.; Department of Computer Engineering, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey.; Department of Computer Engineering, Bogaziçi University, Istanbul, Turkey.; School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Zografou, Athens, Greece.; Graduate Institute of Biomedical Informatics, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Electrical Engineering, National Kaousiung University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.; Department of Computer Science, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.; College of Computer Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.; Department of Statistics, Florida State University, Florida, USA.; Department of Statistics, Florida State University, Florida, USA.; Department of Statistics, Florida State University, Florida, USA.; National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.",10.1093/database/bay147

All of Us,40437102,Computable phenotypes to identify respiratory viral infections in the All of Us research program.,"Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich temporal data about respiratory viral infections, but methods to identify these infections from EHR data vary widely and lack robust validation. We developed computable phenotypes by integrating virus-specific International Classification of Diseases (ICD) billing codes, prescriptions, and laboratory results within 90-day episodes. Analysis of 265,222 participants with EHR data from the All of Us Research Program yielded national cohorts of varied size: large cohorts for SARS-CoV-2 (n = 28,729) and influenza (n = 19,784); medium cohorts for rhinovirus, human coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (n = 1,161-1,620); and smaller cohorts for the other viruses (n = 238-486). Using laboratory results as a reference standard, phenotypes using virus-specific ICD codes and medications had variable sensitivity (8-67%) but high positive predictive value (PPV, 90-97%) for most viruses, while influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 phenotypes had lower PPV (69-70%) that improved with the inclusion of additional ICD codes. Identified infections exhibited expected seasonal patterns matching CDC data. This integrated approach identified infections more effectively than individual components alone and demonstrated utility for severe infections in hospital settings. This method enables large-scale studies of host genetics, health disparities, and clinical outcomes across episodic diseases, with flexibility to optimize sensitivity or PPV depending on the specific research question.","Waxse, Bennett J; Bustos Carrillo, Fausto Andres; Tran, Tam C; Mo, Huan; Ricotta, Emily E; Denny, Joshua C",Scientific reports,2025,"Humans; Phenotype; United States; Respiratory Tract Infections; Electronic Health Records; International Classification of Diseases; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Virus Diseases; Female; Male; Influenza, Human; Adult; Middle Aged; Aged",Computable phenotype; Electronic health records; Influenza virus; Precision medicine; Reproducibility of results; Respiratory tract infections,"National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Department of Preventive Medicine and Biostatistics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. joshua.denny@nih.gov.; All of Us Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. joshua.denny@nih.gov.",10.1038/s41598-025-02183-9

Our objectives were to evaluate the burden of HIV and major depressive disorder (MDD) in underrepresented groups and the frequency of the HIV/MDD comorbidity. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis combining collected survey and electronic health record (EHR) data. We ascertained HIV and MDD cases using Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership codes. We used multivariable logistic regression to obtain the odds ratio of HIV in AoU participants and MDD in AoU participants with HIV. The latest AoU data release includes 412 211 participants: 254 700 have at least one medical condition concept in their EHR, of whom 5193 (1.3%) had HIV, and 2238 (43%) of those with HIV had a diagnosis of MDD. Black AoU participants had approximately 4.58 times the odds of having an HIV diagnosis compared with the combined odds of all other racial groups. AoU participants with HIV were more likely to have MDD (p = 0.001) than were participants without HIV. Among AoU participants, Black individuals have a disproportionately high burden of HIV, pointing to underlying factors such as social determinants of health, limited access to healthcare or prevention resources, and potential systemic biases that contribute to these differences.

Employing the Logic Learning Machine (LLM), an advanced artificial intelligence system, we scrutinized electronic health records of 1.5 million patients treated in 271 diabetes clinics affiliated with the Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists from 2005 to 2019. Inclusion criteria comprised patients on metformin monotherapy with two consecutive mean HbA1c levels exceeding 7.0%. The cohort was divided into ""inertia-NO"" (20,067 patients with prompt intensification) and ""inertia-YES"" (13,029 patients without timely intensification). The LLM model demonstrated robust discriminatory ability among the two groups (ROC-AUC = 0.81, accuracy = 0.71, precision = 0.80, recall = 0.71, F1 score = 0.75). The main novelty of our results is indeed the identification of two main distinct subtypes of therapeutic inertia. The first exhibited a gradual but steady HbA1c increase, while the second featured a moderate, non-uniform rise with substantial fluctuations. Our analysis sheds light on the significant impact of HbA1c levels over time on therapeutic inertia in patients with T2D, emphasizing the importance of early intervention in the presence of specific HbA1c patterns.","Musacchio, Nicoletta; Zilich, Rita; Masi, Davide; Baccetti, Fabio; Nreu, Besmir; Bruno Giorda, Carlo; Guaita, Giacomo; Morviducci, Lelio; Muselli, Marco; Ozzello, Alessandro; Pisani, Federico; Ponzani, Paola; Rossi, Antonio; Santin, Pierluigi; Verda, Damiano; Di Cianni, Graziano; Candido, Riccardo",International journal of medical informatics,2024,"Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Metformin; Glycated Hemoglobin; Machine Learning; Female; Hypoglycemic Agents; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Electronic Health Records; Algorithms; Treatment Failure; Blood Glucose",Artificial intelligence; HbA1c; Machine learning; Metformin failure; Metformin monotherapy; Therapeutic inertia; Type 2 diabetes,"AMD-AI National Group Coordinator, UOS Integrating Primary and Specialist Care, ASST Nord Milano, Via Filippo Carcano 17, 20149 Milan, Italy.; Mix-x Partner, Via Circonvallazione 5, Ivrea (TO), Italy.

All of Us,39747168,Integrating electronic health records and GWAS summary statistics to predict the progression of autoimmune diseases from preclinical stages.,"Autoimmune diseases often exhibit a preclinical stage before diagnosis. Electronic health record (EHR) based-biobanks contain genetic data and diagnostic information, which can identify preclinical individuals at risk for progression. Biobanks typically have small numbers of cases, which are not sufficient to construct accurate polygenic risk scores (PRS). Importantly, progression and case-control phenotypes may have shared genetic basis, which we can exploit to improve prediction accuracy. We propose a novel method Genetic Progression Score (GPS) that integrates biobank and case-control study to predict the disease progression risk. Via penalized regression, GPS incorporates PRS weights for case-control studies as prior and forces model parameters to be similar to the prior if the prior improves prediction accuracy. In simulations, GPS consistently yields better prediction accuracy than alternative strategies relying on biobank or case-control samples only and those combining biobank and case-control samples. The improvement is particularly evident when biobank sample is smaller or the genetic correlation is lower. We derive PRS for the progression from preclinical rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus in the BioVU biobank and validate them in All of Us. For both diseases, GPS achieves the highest prediction ","Wang, Chen; Markus, Havell; Diwadkar, Avantika R; Khunsriraksakul, Chachrit; Carrel, Laura; Li, Bingshan; Zhong, Xue; Wang, Xingyan; Zhan, Xiaowei; Foulke, Galen T; Olsen, Nancy J; Liu, Dajiang J; Jiang, Bibo",Nature communications,2025,"Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Electronic Health Records; Disease Progression; Case-Control Studies; Autoimmune Diseases; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Multifactorial Inheritance; Female; Biological Specimen Banks; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,"Bioinformatics and Genomics Graduate Program, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, USA.; Department of Public Health Sciences, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, USA.; Bioinformatics and Genomics Graduate Program, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, USA.; Bioinformatics and Genomics Graduate Program, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, USA.; Department of Public Health Sciences, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, USA.; Bioinformatics and Genomics Graduate Program, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, USA.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, USA.; Department of Molecular Physiology & Biophysics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Medicine, Division of Genetic Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Public Health Sciences, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, USA.; Department of Statistical Science, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA.; Department of Population and Data Sciences, Quantitative Biomedical Research Center, Southwestern Medical Center University of Texas, Dallas, TX, USA.; Center for Genetics of Host Defense, Southwestern Medical Center University of Texas, Dallas, TX, USA.; Department of Public Health Sciences, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, USA.; Department of Dermatology, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, USA.; Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, USA.; Bioinformatics and Genomics Graduate Program, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, USA. dajiang.liu@psu.edu.; Department of Public Health Sciences, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, USA. dajiang.liu@psu.edu.; Department of Public Health Sciences, College of Medicine, Penn State University, Hershey, PA, USA. bjiang@phs.psu.edu.",10.1038/s41467-024-55636-6

All of Us,39813673,"Building a Digital Health Research Platform to Enable Recruitment, Enrollment, Data Collection, and Follow-Up for a Highly Diverse Longitudinal US Cohort of 1 Million People in the All of Us Research Program: Design and Implementation Study.","Longitudinal cohort studies have traditionally relied on clinic-based recruitment models, which limit cohort diversity and the generalizability of research outcomes. Digital research platforms can be used to increase participant access, improve study engagement, streamline data collection, and increase data quality; however, the efficacy and sustainability of digitally enabled studies rely heavily on the design, implementation, and management of the digital platform being used. We sought to design and build a secure, privacy-preserving, validated, participant-centric digital health research platform (DHRP) to recruit and enroll participants, collect multimodal data, and engage participants from diverse backgrounds in the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) All of Us Research Program (AOU). AOU is an ongoing national, multiyear study aimed to build a research cohort of 1 million participants that reflects the diversity of the United States, including minority, health-disparate, and other populations underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR). We collaborated with community members, health care provider organizations (HPOs), and NIH leadership to design, build, and validate a secure, feature-rich digital platform to facilitate multisite, hybrid, and remote study participation and multimodal data collection in AOU. Participants were recruited by in-person, print, and online digital campaigns. Participants securely accessed the DHRP via web and mobile apps, either independently or with research staff support. The participant-facing tool facilitated electronic informed consent (eConsent), multisource data collection (eg, surveys, genomic results, wearables, and electronic health records [EHRs]), and ongoing participant engagement. We also built tools for research staff to conduct remote participant support, study workflow management, participant tracking, data analytics, data harmonization, and data management. We built a secure, participant-centric DHRP with engaging functionality used to recruit, engage, and collect data from 705,719 diverse participants throughout the United States. As of April 2024, 87% (n=613,976) of the participants enrolled via the platform were from UBR groups, including racial and ethnic minorities (n=282,429, 46%), rural dwelling individuals (n=49,118, 8%), those over the age of 65 years (n=190,333, 31%), and individuals with low socioeconomic status (n=122,795, 20%). We built a participant-centric digital platform with tools to enable engagement with individuals from different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds and other UBR groups. This DHRP demonstrated successful use among diverse participants.

All of Us,38583580,Discovering clinical drug-drug interactions with known pharmacokinetics mechanisms using spontaneous reporting systems and electronic health records.,"Although the mechanisms behind pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are well-documented, bridging the gap between this knowledge and clinical evidence of DDIs, especially for serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs), remains challenging. While leveraging the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database along with disproportionality analysis tends to detect a vast number of DDI signals, this abundance complicates further investigation, such as validation through clinical trials. Our study proposed a framework to efficiently prioritize these signals and assessed their reliability using multi-source Electronic Health Records (EHR) to identify top candidates for further investigation. We analyzed FAERS data spanning from January 2004 to March 2023, employing four established disproportionality methods: Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS), and Bayesian Confidence Propagating Neural Network (BCPNN). Building upon these models, we developed four ranking models to prioritize DDI-SADR signals and cross-referenced signals with DrugBank. To validate the top-ranked signals, we employed longitudinal EHRs from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the All of Us research program. The performance of each model was assessed by counting how many of the top-ranked signals were confirmed by EHRs and calculating the average ranking of these confirmed signals. Out of 189 DDI-SADR signals identified by all four disproportionality methods, only two were documented in the DrugBank database. By prioritizing the top 20 signals as determined by each of the four disproportionality methods and our four ranking models, 58 unique DDI-SADR signals were selected for EHR validations. Of these, five signals were confirmed. The ranking model, which integrated the MGPS and BCPNN, demonstrated superior performance by assigning the highest priority to those five EHR-confirmed signals. The fusion of disproportionality analysis with ranking models, validated through multi-source EHRs, presents a groundbreaking approach to pharmacovigilance. Our study's confirmation of five significant DDI-SADRs, previously unrecorded in the DrugBank database, highlights the essential role of advanced data analysis techniques in identifying ADRs.","Jeong, Eugene; Su, Yu; Li, Lang; Chen, You",Journal of biomedical informatics,2024,"Electronic Health Records; Humans; Drug Interactions; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Bayes Theorem; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration; Databases, Factual; Neural Networks, Computer; Pharmacokinetics; Reproducibility of Results",EHR; FAERS; Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions; Ranking algorithms; Serious adverse drug reactions; Translational informatics,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States; Department of Computer Science, School of Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States.

We analyzed 410 298 patient records from the All of Us Research Program, including 9375 lung cancer cases identified through SNOMED coding. Using Logistic LASSO regression, we developed predictive models based on diagnoses grouped by body systems and their interactions. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and immune systems showed three-fold greater association with lung cancer than other systems. Brain metastasis showed the strongest association (odds ratio 5.0, 95% CI: 4.2-5.8). The final model achieved an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.80-0.84) and 78% sensitivity in validation. Patients with documented social determinants showed 2.5-fold higher risk (95% CI: 2.1-2.9).

All of Us,30779778,Data model harmonization for the All Of Us Research Program: Transforming i2b2 data into the OMOP common data model.,"The All Of Us Research Program (AOU) is building a nationwide cohort of one million patients' EHR and genomic data. Data interoperability is paramount to the program's success. AOU is standardizing its EHR data around the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model. OMOP is one of several standard data models presently used in national-scale initiatives. Each model is unique enough to make interoperability difficult. The i2b2 data warehousing and analytics platform is used at over 200 sites worldwide, which uses a flexible ontology-driven approach for data storage. We previously demonstrated this ontology system can drive data reconfiguration, to transform data into new formats without site-specific programming. We previously implemented this on our 12-site Accessible Research Commons for Health (ARCH) network to transform i2b2 into the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network model. Here, we leverage our investment in i2b2 high-performance transformations to support the AOU OMOP data pipeline. Because the ARCH ontology has gained widespread national interest (through the Accrual to Clinical Trials network, other PCORnet networks, and the Nebraska Lexicon), we leveraged sites' existing investments into this standard ontology. We developed an i2b2-to-OMOP transformation, driven by the ARCH-OMOP ontology and the OMOP concept mapping dictionary. We demonstrated and validated our approach in the AOU New England HPO (NEHPO). First, we transformed into OMOP a fake patient dataset in i2b2 and verified through AOU tools that the data was structurally compliant with OMOP. We then transformed a subset of data in the Partners Healthcare data warehouse into OMOP. We developed a checklist of assessments to ensure the transformed data had self-integrity (e.g., the distributions have an expected shape and required fields are populated), using OMOP's visual Achilles data quality tool. This i2b2-to-OMOP transformation is being used to send NEHPO production data to AOU. It is open-source and ready for use by other research projects.","Klann, Jeffrey G; Joss, Matthew A H; Embree, Kevin; Murphy, Shawn N",PloS one,2019,"Biomedical Research; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Delivery of Health Care; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; United States",,"Research Information Science and Computing, Partners Healthcare, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Laboratory of Computer Science, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Research Information Science and Computing, Partners Healthcare, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Personalized Medicine, Partners Healthcare, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Research Information Science and Computing, Partners Healthcare, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Laboratory of Computer Science, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.",10.1371/journal.pone.0212463
All of Us,39574876,Reducing Information and Selection Bias in EHR-Linked Biobanks via Genetics-Informed Multiple Imputation and Sample Weighting.,"Electronic health records (EHRs) are valuable for public health and clinical research but are prone to many sources of bias, including missing data and non-probability selection. Missing data in EHRs is complex due to potential non-recording, fragmentation, or clinically informative absences. This study explores whether polygenic risk score (PRS)-informed multiple imputation for missing traits, combined with sample weighting, can mitigate missing data and selection biases in estimating disease-exposure associations. Simulations were conducted for missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR) conditions under different sampling mechanisms. PRS-informed multiple imputation showed generally lower bias, particularly when combined with sample weighting. For example, in biased samples of 10,000 with exposure and outcome MAR data, PRS-informed imputation had lower percent bias (3.8%) and better coverage rate (0.883) compared to PRS-uninformed (4.5%; 0.877) and complete case analyses (10.3%; 0.784) in covariate-adjusted, weighted, multiple imputation scenarios. In a case study using Michigan Genomics Initiative (n=50,026) data, PRS-informed imputation aligned more closely with a sample-weighted All of Us-derived benchmark than analyses ignoring missing data and selection bias. Researchers should consider leveraging genetic data and sample weighting to address biases from missing data and non-probability sampling in biobanks.","Salvatore, Maxwell; Kundu, Ritoban; Du, Jiacong; Friese, Christopher R; Mondul, Alison M; Hanauer, David; Lu, Haidong; Pearce, Celeste Leigh; Mukherjee, Bhramar",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024,,biobank; electronic health records; exposome; missing data; selection bias,"Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Systems, Populations, and Leadership, School of Nursing, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Health Management and Policy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Systems, Populations, and Leadership, School of Nursing, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Learning Health Sciences, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Section of General Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Public Health Modeling Unit, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Systems, Populations, and Leadership, School of Nursing, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.",10.1101/2024.10.28.24316286

The introduction of CFTR modulators, including elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI), offers promise for improving sinonasal outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort multicenter study analyzing electronic medical records of 45 adult CF patients with CRS, predominantly heterozygous for the ΔF508 mutation, treated with ETI between January 2018 and December 2023. Assessments included Sinonasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT-22), Nasal Polyp Score (NPS), modified Lund-Kennedy Score (mLKS), Lund-Mackay Score (LMS), and olfactory function using smell loss visual analog scale (VAS) and Sniffin' Sticks identification test (SSIT). After 12 months of ETI therapy, significant improvements were observed in pulmonary function parameters (FEV1, FVC), CRS severity scores (SNOT-22, NPS, mLKS), radiological findings (LMS), and olfactory function. Subgroup analysis suggested enhanced efficacy in patients with prior endoscopic sinonasal surgery. ETI therapy demonstrates comprehensive improvements in CRS and olfactory function in CF patients, highlighting the potential of CFTR modulators in managing sinonasal manifestations.","Minzoni, Alberto; Mazzetti, Luca; Orlando, Pietro; Licci, Giuseppe; Taccetti, Giovanni; Bresci, Silvia; Maggiore, Giandomenico",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,2024,Humans; Sinusitis; Rhinitis; Cystic Fibrosis; Female; Male; Chronic Disease; Retrospective Studies; Adult; Aminophenols; Drug Combinations; Quinolones; Indoles; Benzodioxoles; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator; Pyrazoles; Pyridines; Middle Aged; Nasal Polyps; Young Adult; Quality of Life; Thiophenes; Sino-Nasal Outcome Test; Treatment Outcome; Chloride Channel Agonists; Rhinosinusitis; Quinolines,CFTR modulators; Chronic rhinosinusitis; Cystic fibrosis; Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor; Smell,"Department of Human Science, Università degli studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy.; Department of Human Science, Università degli studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy.; Department of Otolaryngology, AOU Careggi, Largo Piero Palagi, 1, 50139, Firenze, FI, Italy. rlnptr91@gmail.com.; Department of Human Science, Università degli studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy.; Meyer IRCCS, Cystic Fibrosis Unit, Firenze, Italy.; AOU Careggi, Cystic Fibrosis Unit, Firenze, Italy.; Department of Otolaryngology, AOU Careggi, Largo Piero Palagi, 1, 50139, Firenze, FI, Italy.",10.1007/s00405-024-08888-3

However, to date the genetic determinants of human T-cell abundance have not been studied at scale because assays quantifying T-cell abundance are not widely used in clinical or research settings. The complete blood count clinical assay quantifies lymphocyte abundance which includes T-cells, B-cells, and NK-cells. To address this gap, we directly estimate T-cell fractions from whole genome sequencing data in over 200,000 individuals from the multi-ethnic TOPMed and All of Us studies. We identified 27 loci associated with T-cell fraction. Interrogating electronic health records identified clinical phenotypes associated with T-cell fraction, including notable changes in T-cell proportions that were highly dynamic over the course of pregnancy. In summary, by estimating T-cell fraction, we obtained new insights into the genetic regulation of T-cells and identified disease consequences of T-cell fractions across the human phenome.","Poisner, Hannah; Faucon, Annika; Cox, Nancy; Bick, Alexander G",Nature communications,2024,"Humans; T-Lymphocytes; Phenotype; Female; Pregnancy; Male; Genome-Wide Association Study; Whole Genome Sequencing; Lymphocyte Count; Adult; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,"Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.; Division of Genetic Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA. alexander.bick@vumc.org.; Division of Genetic Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. alexander.bick@vumc.org.",10.1038/s41467-024-51095-1
All of Us,39243700,Hispanic individuals' cervical cancer screening disparities amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.,"To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cervical cancer screening rates of Hispanic individuals compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals in the United States, whether a responsive surge in catch-up screenings occurred as society adapted to pandemic changes, and to investigate the sociodemographic characteristics between the study populations. Using cross-sectional data from the All of Us Research Program, which incorporates electronic health record data and survey data from a demographically, geographically, and medically diverse participant group, we assessed the annual cervical cancer screening rates during 2019-2021 by race/ethnicity among eligible individuals ages 21-64. Among 116,052 unique individuals (78,829 NHW and 37,223 Hispanic), Hispanic individuals had lower annual cervical cancer screening rates than NHWI across the three years studied. They experienced a more significant decrease in screening from 2019 to 2020 (39.27 %) compared to NHWIs (21.15 %) and less of a rebound increase in the following year, 2021 (10.33 % vs 13.83 %). Hispanic individuals aged 50-64 experienced the sharpest decline in screening rates (-43.01 % from 2019 to 2020). Hispanic individuals also experienced greater adverse social conditions, including lack of insurance or employment, lower educational attainment, and lower household income. Hispanic individuals experienced a more significant decrease in cervical cancer screening rates with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with NHW individuals and did not experience a robust rebound in cervical cancer screening rates in 2021. As a result, the disparity in cervical cancer screening rates between NHW and Hispanic individuals considerably worsened with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nguyen, Linh; Chung, Tong Han; Le, Yen-Chi L; Reygaerts, Hannah; Olguin, Xochitl; Zamorano, Abigail",Gynecologic oncology,2024,Adult; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Young Adult; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Healthcare Disparities; Hispanic or Latino; United States; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; White,COVID-19; Cancer screening; Cervical cancer disparities; Hispanics/Latinas; Social determinants of health; Underserved,"The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, UT Physicians Center of Population Health Management & Quality, 1200 Binz Street, Suite 730, Houston, TX 77004, United States of America.

With this paper we aimed to identify, adopting topological data analysis, the risk factors for therapeutic failure (in-hospital death or intensive care unit transfer), the in-hospital occurrence of stroke/TIA and major bleeding in a cohort of critically ill patients with pre-existing atrial fibrillation admitted to a stepdown unit; to engineer newer prediction models based on machine learning in the same cohort. We selected all medical patients admitted for critical illness and a history of pre-existing atrial fibrillation in the timeframe 01/01/2002-03/08/2007. All data regarding patients' medical history, comorbidities, drugs adopted, vital parameters and outcomes (therapeutic failure, stroke/TIA and major bleeding) were acquired from electronic medical records. Risk factors for each outcome were analyzed adopting topological data analysis. Machine learning was used to generate three different predictive models. We were able to identify specific risk factors and to engineer dedicated clinical prediction models for therapeutic failure (AUC: 0.974, 95%CI: 0.934-0.975), stroke/TIA (AUC: 0.931, 95%CI: 0.896-0.940; Brier score: 0.13) and major bleeding (AUC: 0.930:0.911-0.939; Brier score: 0.09) in critically-ill patients, which were able to predict accurately their respective clinical outcomes. Topological data analysis and machine learning techniques represent a concrete viewpoint for the physician to predict the risk at the patients' level, aiding the selection of the best therapeutic strategy in critically ill patients affected by pre-existing atrial fibrillation.","Falsetti, Lorenzo; Rucco, Matteo; Proietti, Marco; Viticchi, Giovanna; Zaccone, Vincenzo; Scarponi, Mattia; Giovenali, Laura; Moroncini, Gianluca; Nitti, Cinzia; Salvi, Aldo",Scientific reports,2021,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Atrial Fibrillation; Critical Illness; Female; Hemorrhage; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Machine Learning; Male; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Stroke; Treatment Failure",,"Internal and Sub-Intensive Medicine Department, A.O.U.

All of Us,39095751,"Sexual orientation, gender identity and virologic failure among people with HIV: a cohort study in all of US research program.","Sexual and gender minorities (SGMs) are at higher risk of HIV incidence compared to their heterosexual cisgender counterparts. Despite the high HIV disease burden among SGMs, there was limited data on whether they are at higher risk of virologic failure, which may lead to potential disease progression and increased transmission risk. The All of Us (AoU) Research Program, a national community-engaged program aiming to improve health and facilitate health equity in the United States by partnering with one million participants, provides a promising resource for identifying a diverse and large volunteer TGD cohort. Leveraging various data sources available through AoU, the current study aims to explore the association between sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) and longitudinal virologic failure among adult people with HIV (PWH) in the US. This retrospective cohort study used integrated electronic health records (EHR) and self-reported survey data from the All of Us (AoU) controlled tier data, version 7, which includes participants enrolled in the AoU research program from May 31, 2017, to July 1, 2022. Based on participants' sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex assigned at birth, their SOGI were categorized into six groups, including cisgender heterosexual women, cisgender heterosexual men, cisgender sexual minority women, cisgender sexual minority men, gender minority people assigned female at birth of any sexual orientation, and gender minority people assigned male at birth of any sexual orientation. Yearly virologic failure was defined yearly after one's first viral load testing, and individuals with at least one viral load test > 50 copies/mL during a year were defined as having virologic failure at that year. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to explore the association between SOGI and longitudinal virologic failure while adjusting for potential confounders, including age, race, ethnicity, education attainment, income, and insurance type. A total of 1,546 eligible PWH were extracted from the AoU database, among whom 1,196 (77.36%) had at least one viral failure and 773 (50.00%) belonged to SGMs. Compared to cisgender heterosexual women, cisgender sexual minority women (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.05-3.27) were at higher risk of HIV virologic failure. Additionally, PWH who were Black vs. White (aOR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.52-3.04) and whose insurance type was Medicaid vs. Private insurance (aOR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.33-3.21) were more likely to experience virologic failure. Maintaining frequent viral load monitoring among sexual minority women with HIV is warranted because it allows early detection of virologic failure, which could provide opportunities for interventions to strengthen treatment adherence and prevent HIV transmission. To understand the specific needs of subgroups of SGMs, future research needs to examine the mechanisms for SOGI-based disparities in virologic failure and the combined effects of multi-level psychosocial and health behavior characteristics.","Shi, Fanghui; Cai, Ruilie; He, Buwei; Li, Xiaoming; Yang, Xueying; Weissman, Sharon; Olatosi, Bankole; Zhang, Jiajia",BMC public health,2024,Humans; HIV Infections; Female; Male; Adult; United States; Retrospective Studies; Gender Identity; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Middle Aged; Sexual Behavior; Viral Load; Young Adult; Treatment Failure,Gender identity; HIV; Sexual orientation; Virologic failure,"South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, 29208, USA.

Using a de-identified electronic health record (EHR) database with an associated DNA biobank, we identified 789 SLE cases and 2,261 controls with available MEGA SLE cases had a significantly higher PheRS (mean ± SD 7.7 ± 8.0 versus 0.8 ± 2.0 in controls; P < 0.001) and GRS (mean ± SD 12.2 ± 2.3 versus 11.0 ± 2.0 in controls; P < 0.001). Black individuals with SLE had a higher PheRS compared to White individuals (mean ± SD 10.0 ± 10.1 versus 7.1 ± 7.2, respectively; P = 0.002) but a lower GRS (mean ± SD 9.0 ± 1.4 versus 12.3 ± 1.7, respectively; P < 0.001). Models predicting SLE that used only the PheRS had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87. Adding the GRS to the PheRS resulted in a minimal difference with an AUC of 0.89. On chart review, controls with the highest PheRS and GRS had undiagnosed SLE. We developed a SLE PheRS to identify established and undiagnosed SLE individuals. A SLE GRS using known risk SNPs did not add value beyond the PheRS and was of limited utility in Black individuals with SLE. More work is needed to understand the genetic risks of SLE in diverse populations.","Barnado, April; Wheless, Lee; Camai, Alex; Green, Sarah; Han, Bryan; Katta, Anish; Denny, Joshua C; Sawalha, Amr H","Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",2023,"Humans; Electronic Health Records; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Risk Factors; Phenotype; White",,"Division of Rheumatology & Immunology, Department of Medicine, and Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Division of Epidemiology, Department of Dermatology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Division of Rheumatology & Immunology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Division of Rheumatology & Immunology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Division of Rheumatology & Immunology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Division of Rheumatology & Immunology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; All of Us Research Program, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.; Departments of Pediatrics, Medicine, and Immunology, and Lupus Center of Excellence, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",10.1002/art.42544

We used the beta release of the All of Us Researcher Workbench with clinical and survey data from a population of 225 000 subjects. We identified 3 cohorts of individuals at high risk to develop lung cancer based on (1) the 2013 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force criteria, (2) the long-term quitters of cigarette smoking criteria, and (3) the younger age of onset criteria. We applied the logistic regression analysis to identify the significant associations between individuals' phenotypes and their risk categories. We validated our findings against a lung cancer cohort from the same population and conducted an expert review to understand whether these associations are known or potentially novel. We found a total of 214 statistically significant associations (P < .05 with a Bonferroni correction and odds ratio > 1.5) enriched in the high-risk individuals from 3 cohorts, and 15 enriched in the low-risk individuals. Forty significant associations enriched in the high-risk individuals and 13 enriched in the low-risk individuals were validated in the cancer cohort. Expert review identified 15 potentially new associations enriched in the high-risk individuals. It is feasible to conduct a phenome-wide association study to characterize phenotypic abnormalities associated in high-risk individuals developing lung cancer using electronic health records.

All of Us,39181122,Characterizing apparent treatment resistant hypertension in the United States: insights from the All of Us Research Program.,"Hypertension (HTN) remains a significant public health concern and the primary modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in the United States. We applied our validated HTN computable phenotypes within the All of Us Research Program to uncover prevalence and characteristics of HTN and apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (aTRH) in United States. Within the All of Us Researcher Workbench, we built a retrospective cohort (January 1, 2008-July 1, 2023), identifying all adults with available age data, at least one blood pressure (BP) measurement, prescribed at least one antihypertensive medication, and with at least one SNOMED ""Essential hypertension"" diagnosis code. We identified 99 461 participants with HTN who met the eligibility criteria. Following the application of our computable phenotypes, an overall population of 81 462 were further categorized to aTRH (14.4%), stable-controlled HTN (SCH) (39.5%), and Other HTN (46.1%). Compared to participants with SCH, participants with aTRH were older, more likely to be of Black or African American race, had higher levels of social deprivation, and a heightened prevalence of comorbidities such as hyperlipidemia and diabetes. Heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes were the comorbidities most strongly associated with aTRH. β-blockers were the most prescribed antihypertensive medication. At index date, the overall BP control rate was 62%. All of Us provides a unique opportunity to characterize HTN in the United States.

Maternal weight and offspring anthropometric outcomes before 36 months were extracted from Electronic Medical Record of Zhoushan, China. GWG trajectory was modeled using latent-class trajectory analysis. Multiple generalized estimating equations models were applied to analyze associations of GWG trajectory categories with early children growth. Three GWG trajectory classes were identified in all participants (n = 13 424), the non-GDM (n = 10 984) and GDM (n = 2440) groups, respectively. In all participants, the Slow-Rapid pattern was significantly associated with lower length z-scores of offspring (β = -0.084; se = 0.015), compared to the Moderate pattern, while the Rapid-Slow pattern was significantly associated with higher length z-scores (β = 0.083; se = 0.022), with no significant effects on other anthropometric outcomes. Similar results were also observed in the non-GDM group. However, in the GDM group, offspring of mothers with the Rapid-Slow pattern showed significantly higher weight z-scores (β = 0.093; se = 0.046), BMI z-scores (β = 0.113; se = 0.052), and risk of overweight/obesity (OR = 1.40, 95%CI: 1.11, 1.76). GWG trajectory significantly impacted offspring growth before 36 months, with different effects observed based on GDM status. GWG trajectory primarily affected offspring length in the non-GDM group, whereas earlier high weight gain appeared to increase offspring weight, BMI, and risk of overweight/obesity in the GDM group.","Huang, Ye; Ainiwan, Diliyaer; Qiu, Yiwen; Zhang, Libi; Alifu, Xialidan; Cheng, Haoyue; Zhou, Haibo; Xu, Nuo; Wang, Boya; Wang, Shuhui; Liu, Hui; Chen, Danqing; Yu, Yunxian",Nutrition & diabetes,2025,"Humans; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Pregnancy; Gestational Weight Gain; Adult; Male; Child, Preschool; China; Child Development; Cohort Studies; Infant; Body-Weight Trajectory; Body Mass Index; Infant, Newborn",,"Department of Public Health, and Department of Anesthesiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Epidemiology & Health Statistics, School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Public Health, and Department of Anesthesiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Epidemiology & Health Statistics, School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Public Health, and Department of Anesthesiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Epidemiology & Health Statistics, School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Public Health, and Department of Anesthesiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Epidemiology & Health Statistics, School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Public Health, and Department of Anesthesiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Epidemiology & Health Statistics, School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Public Health, and Department of Anesthesiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Epidemiology & Health Statistics, School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Public Health, and Department of Anesthesiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Epidemiology & Health Statistics, School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Public Health, and Department of Anesthesiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Epidemiology & Health Statistics, School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Public Health, and Department of Anesthesiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Epidemiology & Health Statistics, School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Public Health, and Department of Anesthesiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Epidemiology & Health Statistics, School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Obstetrics, Women's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Public Health, and Department of Anesthesiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China. yunxianyu@zju.edu.cn.; Department of Epidemiology & Health Statistics, School of Public Health, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. yunxianyu@zju.edu.cn.",10.1038/s41387-025-00365-y
All of Us,39808608,Epidemiological trends and healthcare disparities in onychomycosis: An analysis of the All of Us research program.,"Onychomycosis is a common, difficult to treat nail disorder. Our objective was to explore disparities in current clinical management practices for onychomycosis in patients from underrepresented groups and with specific comorbidities. We conducted a cross-sectional study using the All of Us (AoU) research program. The AoU program gathers survey, and electronic health records from participants in the United States with the aim of increasing the representation of minorities groups in health research under the framework of precision medicine. We identified 18,763 onychomycosis patients (2017-2022) and compared the rates of diagnostic testing, prescription medications and surgical procedures. Younger patients were more likely to receive oral medications, while older patients were more likely to undergo surgical nail procedures. Patients with lower income and education, Black and Hispanic patients were less likely to receive testing to confirm diagnosis, and less likely to receive prescription medications (topical and/or oral) except in the case of fluconazole. Lower income and education were associated with a higher likelihood of debridement and trimming procedures, while Black and Hispanic patients were less likely to undergo these procedures. Patients with disabilities also received different treatments when compared to able-bodied individuals, being less likely to receive ciclopirox, efinaconazole and terbinafine, but more likely to undergo debridement and trimming procedures. There are clear differences in the management of onychomycosis in the different demographic and comorbid populations that we studied. Efforts to reduce these inequalities, such as expanded health coverage, reducing communication barriers and increasing patient and physician education are needed.","Gupta, Aditya K; Economopoulos, Vasiliki; Wang, Tong; Piguet, Vincent",PloS one,2025,Humans; Onychomycosis; Male; Female; Healthcare Disparities; United States; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Adult; Aged; Young Adult; Adolescent; Antifungal Agents,,"Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Mediprobe Research Inc., London, Ontario, Canada.; Mediprobe Research Inc., London, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Medical Biophysics, Schulich Scholl of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.; Mediprobe Research Inc., London, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, Women's College Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.",10.1371/journal.pone.0316681
All of Us,40028616,Leveraging diagnosis and biometric data from the All of Us Research Program to uncover disparities in obesity diagnosis.,"Despite extensive efforts to standardize definitions of obesity, clinical practices of diagnosing obesity vary widely. This study examined (1) discrepancies between biometric body mass index (BMI) measures of obesity and documented diagnoses of obesity in patient electronic health records (EHRs) and (2) how these discrepancies vary by patient gender and race and ethnicity from an intersectional lens. Observational study of 383,380 participants in the National Institutes of Health  Over half (60 %) of participants with a BMI indicating obesity had no clinical diagnosis of obesity in their EHRs. Adjusting for BMI, comorbidities, and other covariates, women's adjusted odds of diagnosis were far higher than men's (95 % confidence interval 1.66-1.75). However, the gender gap between women's and men's likelihood of diagnosis varied widely across racial groups. Overall, Non-Hispanic (NH) Black women and Hispanic women were the most likely to be diagnosed and NH-Asian men were the least likely to be diagnosed. Men, and particularly NH-Asian men, may be at heightened risk of underdiagnosis of obesity. Women, and especially Hispanic and NH-Black women, may be at heightened risk of unanticipated harms of obesity diagnosis, including stigma and competing demand with other health concerns. Leveraging diagnosis and biometric data from this unique public domain dataset from the All of Us project, this study revealed pervasive disparities in diagnostic attribution by gender, race, and ethnicity.","Arseniev-Koehler, Alina; Tai-Seale, Ming; Cené, Crystal W; Grunvald, Eduardo; Sitapati, Amy",Obesity pillars,2025,,Diagnosis; Gender; Intersectionality; Obesity; Race/ethnicity,"Department of Sociology, Purdue University, Beering Hall Suite 1114, 100 N University Street, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, USA.; Division of Biomedical Informatics, UC San Diego Medicine, 9500 Gilman Dr. MC 0728 La Jolla, California, 92093, USA.; Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering, Purdue University, Gerald D. and Edna E.

Using a custom genotyping array, we integrated deidentified electronic medical records (2003 to 2021) with genomic data to enable GWASs, phenome-wide association studies, and polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis. Among 413,000 participants, 323,397 passed ancestry and quality control filtering. GWASs covered 1085 traits, focusing on diseases prevalent in Taiwan such as type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, gout, and alcoholic liver damage. PRSs were calculated for 238 traits, with the strongest associations observed in musculoskeletal disorders. Incorporating PRS into clinical practice supports early risk prediction and personalized prevention. To further expand translational value, we also conducted pharmacogenomic analysis and human leukocyte antigen typing.

We selected individuals with whole-genome sequencing, Fitbit, and electronic health record data (N=920; 61,333 data points) from the All of Us Research Program. Anxiety PRS were derived with PRS-CS after meta-analyzing anxiety genome-wide association studies from three major cohorts-UK Biobank, FinnGen, and the Million Veterans Program (N Total =364,550). The standard deviation of average RR intervals (SDANN) was calculated using five-minute average RR intervals over full 24-hour heart rate measurements. Antidepressant exposure was defined as an active antidepressant prescription at the time of the HRV measurement in the EHR. The associations of daily SDANN measurements with the anxiety PRS, antidepressant classes, and antidepressant substances were tested. Participants with lifetime diagnoses of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus, and major depression were excluded in sensitivity analyses. One-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to assess potential causal effect of anxiety on SDANN. Anxiety PRS was independently associated with reduced SDANN (beta=-0.08; p=0.003).

We conducted an exploratory analysis using electronic health record (EHR) data from adult participants (N=242,828) in the version 7 Controlled Tier AoU Research Program data release. Data analysis was conducted using Python in a Jupyter notebook environment within the AoU Researcher Workbench. Descriptive statistics included condition frequencies, the number of chronic conditions per participant, and prevalence according to age categories. The presence of a chronic condition was determined by documentation of one or more ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) codes for the respective condition. Age categories were established and aligned with diagnosis dates and stages of adulthood (early adulthood: 18-39 years; middle adulthood: 40-49 years; late middle adulthood: 50-64 years; late adulthood: 65-74 years; advanced old age: 75-89 years). Our findings demonstrated that approximately 76% (n=183,753) of AoU participants were diagnosed with MCC, with over 40% (n=98,885) having 6 or more conditions and prevalence increasing with age (from 33.78% in early adulthood to 68.04% in advanced old age). The most frequently occurring MCC combinations varied by age category. Participants aged 18-39 years primarily presented mental health-related MCC combinations (eg, anxiety and depressive disorders; n=845), whereas those aged 40-64 years frequently had combinations of physical conditions such as fibromyalgia, chronic pain, fatigue, and arthritis (204 in middle adulthood and 457 in late middle adulthood). In late adulthood and advanced old age, hyperlipidemia and hypertension were the most commonly occurring MCC combinations (n=200 and n=59, respectively). We report notable prevalence of MCC throughout adulthood and variability in MCC combinations by age category in AoU participants. The significant prevalence of MCC underscores a considerable public health challenge, revealed by distinct condition combinations that shift across different life stages. Early adulthood is characterized predominantly by mental health conditions, transitioning to cardiometabolic and physical health conditions in middle, late, and advanced ages. These findings highlight the need for targeted, innovative care modalities and population health initiatives to address the burden of MCC throughout adulthood.","Li, Xintong; Dreisbach, Caitlin; Gustafson, Carolina M; Murali, Komal Patel; Koleck, Theresa A",JMIR formative research,2025,"Humans; Adult; Middle Aged; Male; Female; Prevalence; Aged; United States; Young Adult; Multiple Chronic Conditions; Adolescent; Electronic Health Records; Aged, 80 and over; Chronic Disease","

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and identify correlates of Lp(a) testing in a real-world, diverse sample. Participants were ≥18 years of age from the All of Us Research Study who shared electronic medical record information through 2022 (N = 266,612). Completion of Lp(a) testing was defined by the following: presence of Lp(a) values, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms or Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes electronic health record listings for Lp(a) testing, or an Internal Classification of Diseases-10 code for elevated Lp(a). Multivariable logistic regression assessed the association of demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables with Lp(a) testing. The mean age was 52 years, 61% were women, and 53% were non-Hispanic White. A total of 2,172 (0.8%) underwent Lp(a) testing, 86% of whom had clinical cardiovascular disease. Compared to non-Hispanic White individuals, non-Hispanic Black individuals (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.58-0.81) had 32% lower odds of Lp(a) testing. Less than high school education (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.25-0.44), unemployment (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.68-0.85), and disability (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.91) were associated with a 23% to 66% lower odds of Lp(a) testing. Among clinical factors, non-Lp(a) lipid abnormality (OR: 5.64, 95% CI: 4.72-6.79) and prevalent cardiovascular disease (OR: 3.21, 95% CI: 2.76-3.74) were strongly associated with Lp(a) testing. The prevalence of Lp(a) testing among US adults is exceedingly low, especially for non-Hispanic Black individuals and those with socioeconomic risk. These results underline the importance of emphasizing health equity in Lp(a) testing expansion.","Razavi, Alexander C; Richardson, LaTonia C; Coronado, Fátima; Vesper, Hubert W; Lyle, Alicia; Bhatia, Harpreet S; Tsimikas, Sotirios; Quyyumi, Arshed A; Vaccarino, Viola; Eapen, Danny J; Isiadinso, Ijeoma; Mehta, Anurag; Yadalam, Adithya K; Osei, Jeffery; Jacobson, Terry A; Yao, Zhiqi; Dzaye, Omar; Martin, Seth S; Nasir, Khurram; Shapiro, Michael D; Blaha, Michael J; Whelton, Seamus P; Blumenthal, Roger S; Sperling, Laurence S",JACC.

All of Us,39886795,From Paper to Digital: Evaluating Electronic Medical Records and their Compliance with EMA Guidelines in European Clinical Trials.,"Over the past decade, there has been a significant shift from paper-based to digital medical record management, driven largely by advances in digital technology. This transition has led to widespread adoption of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), with the expectation that paper documentation will soon be fully replaced. In response, the European Medicines Agency's ""Guideline on Computerised Systems in Clinical Trials"" outlines essential criteria for validated EMR systems to ensure data integrity and security, and sets standards for electronic source documents in clinical trials. From December 2023 to March 2024, the Italian Group of Data Managers and Clinical Research Coordinators (GIDMcrc) conducted an online survey across clinical research sites in Italy, France and Belgium to assess the characteristics of medical records and source documents. The survey was completed by 37 centres: 70.3% from Italy, 16.2% from France and 13.5% from Belgium. Most sites use a mixed paper/electronic Source Document (SD) system (72.3%), with fewer centres having fully electronic SD systems (13.5%) or fully paper-based systems (16.2%). EMR systems are used in 70.3% of sites, but only 23.8% comply with EMA guidelines for computerised systems. A country-specific analysis was also conducted to further explore the situations in Italy and France/Belgium. Despite the widespread use of electronic medical records (EMRs) in Italy, France and Belgium, Italy lags behind the other two countries in terms of digitization. Despite the presence of an EMR, many centres still use a mixed system of paper and electronic source documents. There is also a lack of awareness regarding EMA and GCP standards, particularly concerning training and system testing. The higher response rate from Italian centres highlights the need for a larger sample in France and Belgium, and a follow-up survey would be beneficial for assessing progress and refining corrective actions.","Stabile, Stefano; Testoni, Sara; Franchina, Veronica; Betti, Marta; Mannozzi, Francesca; Ferrari, Alessandra; Federici, Irene; Doungue, Ludovic; Cagnazzo, Celeste",Reviews on recent clinical trials,2025,,Electronic medical records; clinical research; clinical trials; digital transformation.,"SC Oncologia Falck, Niguarda Cancer Center, Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milano, Italy.; Unità di Biostatistica e Sperimentazioni Cliniche, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", Meldola, Italy.; A.O.

The aim was to assess the landscape and sharing capacities between endocrine researchers. A standardized survey (SurveyMonkey®) with 67 questions was sent to European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors centers. Answers were counted as absolute numbers and percentages. Comparisons between inclusiveness target countries (ITC) and non-ITC (defined by Cooperation in Science & Technology Action) were performed using Fisher's exact test. Seventy-three centers from 34 countries answered the survey. Electronic health record (EHR) systems are now the main source of data (90%). However, significant variability was reported, entailing >35 EHR providers, and variable data collected. Variable stakeholders' implication for enabling data sharing was reported, with more lawyers (P = .023), patient representatives (P < .001), ethicists (P = .002), methodologists (P = .023), and information technology experts (P < .001) in non-ITC centers. Implication of information technologies experts for data collection and sharing was underwhelming (33%). Funding for clinical research was higher in non-ITC than in ITC for clinical trials (P = .01) and for registry-based and cohort studies (P = .05). However, for retrospective studies addressing a specific clinical question, the funding was either very low (<10%) or nonexistent for both ITC and non-ITC (37% and 46%, respectively), with no dedicated funding for information technology (86%) and ethical and regulatory aspects (88%). In the absence of dedicated funding for retrospective research, current requirements for data sharing are obstacles.","Sojat, Antoan Stefan; Rance, Bastien; Neuraz, Antoine; Fassnacht, Martin; Beuschlein, Felix; Robledo, Mercedes; Luconi, Michaela; Vassiliadi, Dimitra; Stell, Anthony; Igaz, Peter; Dugic, Bogdan; Marina, Ljiljana V; Burgun, Anita; Kastelan, Darko; Assie, Guillaume",European journal of endocrinology,2025,Humans; Europe; Retrospective Studies; Information Dissemination; Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Biomedical Research; Electronic Health Records; Surveys and Questionnaires; Endocrinology,adrenal tumors; data sharing; endocrinology; information technologies; legal framework,"National Centre for Infertility and Endocrinology of Gender, Clinic for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, University Clinical Centre of Serbia, Savski venac, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; INSERM, UMR S 1138, Cordeliers Research Center, Université de Paris, 75270 Paris, France.; INSERM, UMR S 1138, Cordeliers Research Center, Université de Paris, 75270 Paris, France.; Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, University Hospital, University of Würzburg, 97080 Würzburg, Germany.; Department of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Clinical Nutrition, University Hospital Zurich (USZ) and University of Zurich (UZH), CH-8091, 1008091 Zurich, Switzerland.; Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Universität, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, 80336 München, Germany.; The LOOP Zurich-Medical Research Center, 8044 Zürich, Switzerland.; Hereditary Endocrine Cancer Group, Human Cancer Genetics Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain.; Biomedical Research Networking Centre on Rare Diseases (CIBERER), Institute of Health Carlos III, 028029 Madrid, Spain.; Endocrinology Unit, Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, 50121 Florence, Italy.; Centro di Ricerca e Innovazione sulle Patologie Surrenaliche, AOU Careggi, 50139 Florence, Italy.; Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, European Reference Network on Rare Endocrine Conditions (ENDO-ERN), Evangelismos Hospital, 10676 Athens, Greece.; Melbourne eResearch Group (D.A.S.), University of Melbourne, VIC 3010 Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Endocrinology, ENS@T Research Center of Excellence, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary.; Department of Internal Medicine and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary.; School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.; National Centre for Infertility and Endocrinology of Gender, Clinic for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, University Clinical Centre of Serbia, Savski venac, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.; INSERM, UMR S 1138, Cordeliers Research Center, Université de Paris, 75270 Paris, France.; School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.; Department of Endocrinology, University Hospital Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.; Department of Endocrinology, Reference Center for Rare Adrenal Diseases, Reference Center for Rare Adrenal Cancers, Hôpital Cochin, Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris, 75014 Paris, France.; Institut Cochin, Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale U1016, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 8104, Université Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, 75014 Paris, France.",10.1093/ejendo/lvaf005

Real-world data were collected in electronic medical records by 32 Italian diabetes clinics between 2011 and 2021. Primary endpoint was the proportion of insulin-naïve T2D patients treated with GLP-1 RA who initiated (add-on or switch) BI. Secondary endpoints were: treatment approaches, mean time to BI start, effectiveness and safety. Among 7,962 eligible patients, BI was prescribed to 3,164 (39.7%; 95%CI 38.7; 40.8): 67.6% switched to BI (22.1% also starting 1-3 injections of short-acting insulin), 22.7% added BI while maintaining GLP-1 RA, and 9.7% switched to a fixed-ratio combination of GLP-1 RA and BI (FRC). Median time since the first GLP-1 RA to BI/FRC prescription was 27.4 (IQ range 11.8-53.5) months. In this study 60.3% of patients did not start BI/FRC, among whom 15.2% intensified GLP-1 RA therapy with other oral agents. Effectiveness and safety were documented in all intensification approaches with BI/FRC, but HbA1c level at intensification time of ≥9.0% and suboptimal BI titration suggested clinical inertia. Use of second generation BI and add-on to GLP-1 RA schemes increased over time and effectiveness improved. Clinical inertia should be overcome using innovative insulin options. Timely combination therapy of BI and GLP-1 RA is a valuable choice.","Candido, Riccardo; Nicolucci, Antonio; Larosa, Monica; Rossi, Maria Chiara; Napoli, Raffaele","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2023,,Basal insulin; Effectiveness; Fixed-ratio combination; GLP-1 receptor agonists; Insulin naïve; Safety; Type 2 diabetes,"Diabetes Centre District 4, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata, Trieste, Italy.; CORESEARCH, Center for Outcomes Research and Clinical Epidemiology, Pescara, Italy.

To explore mental health disparities between SGM and non-SGM populations across sexual orientation, sex assigned at birth, and gender identity within the All of Us Research Program. This cross-sectional study used survey data and linked electronic health records of eligible All of Us Research Program participants from May 31, 2017, to June 30, 2022. Self-identified SGM status. Prevalence of common mental health conditions identified from linked electronic health records. Logistic regression adjusted for age, race and ethnicity, educational level, income, employment status, and geographic region was used to assess the association between SGM status and mental health conditions. Among 413 457 participants, 269 947 (65.3%) were included in the analysis (median age, 59 [IQR, 43-70] years), with 22 189 (8.2%) self-identified as SGM. Men with cisgender sexual minority identity had higher odds of bipolar disorder (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.70-2.56) compared with cisgender heterosexual men. Women with cisgender sexual minority identity had higher odds of bipolar disorder (AOR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.95-2.25) compared with cisgender heterosexual women. Gender diverse people assigned female sex at birth had higher odds of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared with both cisgender heterosexual men (AOR, 3.67; 95% CI, 2.99-4.50) and cisgender heterosexual women (AOR, 2.77; 95% CI, 2.26-3.40). Gender diverse individuals assigned male sex at birth had higher odds of bipolar disorder (AOR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.66-3.33) compared with cisgender heterosexual men and higher odds of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AOR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.48-3.23) compared with cisgender heterosexual women. Transgender men had higher odds of depression (AOR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.80-2.49) compared with cisgender heterosexual men, while transgender women had higher odds of any personality disorder (AOR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.84-3.99) compared with cisgender heterosexual women. In this cross-sectional study of participants in the All of Us Research Program, there were significant mental health disparities between participants in SGM and non-SGM groups.

Yet, the study and use of PRSs in clinical settings raise equity, clinical, and regulatory challenges that can be greater for individuals from historically marginalized racial, ethnic, and other minoritized communities. As part of the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics IV Network, we conducted online focus groups with patients/community members, clinicians, and members of institutional review boards to explore their views on key issues, including PRS research, return of PRS results, clinical translation, and barriers and facilitators to health behavioral changes in response to PRS results. Across stakeholder groups, our findings indicate support for PRS development and a strong interest in having PRS results returned to research participants. However, we also found multi-level barriers and significant differences in stakeholders' views about what is needed and possible for successful implementation.

All of Us,38960729,Fair prediction of 2-year stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.,"This study aims to develop machine learning models that provide both accurate and equitable predictions of 2-year stroke risk for patients with atrial fibrillation across diverse racial groups. Our study utilized structured electronic health records (EHR) data from the All of Us Research Program. Machine learning models (LightGBM) were utilized to capture the relations between stroke risks and the predictors used by the widely recognized CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores. We mitigated the racial disparity by creating a representative tuning set, customizing tuning criteria, and setting binary thresholds separately for subgroups. We constructed a hold-out test set that not only supports temporal validation but also includes a larger proportion of Black/African Americans for fairness validation. Compared to the original CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores, significant improvements were achieved by modeling their predictors using machine learning models (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve from near 0.70 to above 0.80). Furthermore, applying our disparity mitigation strategies can effectively enhance model fairness compared to the conventional cross-validation approach. Modeling CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors with LightGBM and our disparity mitigation strategies achieved decent discriminative performance and excellent fairness performance. In addition, this approach can provide a complete interpretation of each predictor. These highlight its potential utility in clinical practice. Our research presents a practical example of addressing clinical challenges through the All of Us Research Program data. The disparity mitigation framework we proposed is adaptable across various models and data modalities, demonstrating broad potential in clinical informatics.","Gao, Jifan; Mar, Philip; Tang, Zheng-Zheng; Chen, Guanhua",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Atrial Fibrillation; Black or African American; Electronic Health Records; Machine Learning; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; ROC Curve; Stroke; Racial Groups,atrial fibrillation; bias; fairness; machine learning; stroke,"Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53726, United States.; Department of Internal Medicine, Saint Louis University, School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO 63104, United States.; Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53726, United States.; Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53726, United States.",10.1093/jamia/ocae170

Data from the All of Us Research Program participants ≥50 years old were analyzed using marginal structural modelling to assess if frailty or healthcare delays mediated OSGM status and healthcare utilization. OSGM status, healthcare delays, and frailty were assessed using survey data. Electronic health record (EHR) data was used to measure the number of medical visits or mental health (MH) visit days, following 12 months from the calculated All of Us Frailty Index. Analyses adjusted for age, race and ethnicity, income, HIV, marital status ± general MH (only MH analyses). Compared to non-OSGM, OSGM adults have higher rates of medical visits (adjusted rate ratio [aRR]: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.24) and MH visits (aRR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.91). Frailty mediated the association between OSGM status medical visits (Controlled direct effect [Rcde] aRR: 1.03, 95% CI [0.87, 1.22]), but not MH visits (Rcde aRR: 0.37 [95% CI: 0.06, 1.47]).

Patient portal-based recruitment was implemented at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Patient engagement was assessed using patient's electronic health record (EHR) at four recruitment stages: Consenting to be contacted, opening messages, responding to messages, and showing interest in participating. Demographic and socioeconomic data were also collected from patient's EHR and univariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess patient engagement. Between October 2022 and November 2023, a total of 59 592 patients received patient portal messages inviting them to join the AoURP. Among them, 24 445 (41.0%) opened the message, 8983 (15.1%) responded, and 3765 (6.3%) showed interest in joining the program. Though we were unable to link enrollment data with EHR data, we estimate about 2% of patients contacted ultimately enrolled in the AoURP. Patients from underrepresented race and ethnicity communities had lower odds of consenting to be contacted and opening messages, but higher odds of showing interest after responding. Patient portal messaging provided both patients and recruitment staff with a more efficient approach to outreach, but patterns of engagement varied across UBR groups. Patient portal-based recruitment enables researchers to contact a substantial number of participants from diverse communities. However, more effort is needed to improve engagement from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups at the early stages of the recruitment process.","Beaton, Maura; Jiang, Xinzhuo; Minto, Elise; Lau, Chun Yee; Turner, Lennon; Hripcsak, George; Chaudhari, Kanchan; Natarajan, Karthik",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Humans; Patient Portals; Patient Selection; Biomedical Research; Male; Female; Adult; Middle Aged; Electronic Health Records; Patient Participation; Minority Groups; Ethnic and Racial Minorities; United States; Young Adult; Aged,patient portal; research recruitment; underrepresented in biomedical research,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States.; Center for Precision Medicine and Genomics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, United States.",10.1093/jamia/ocae135

Wearable devices such as Fitbit offer a unique opportunity to objectively measure physical activity metrics, providing insights into the association between different types of physical activity and chronic disease risk. This study aims to examine the association between physical activity metrics derived from Fitbit devices and the incidence of various chronic diseases among participants from the All of Us Research Program. Physical activity metrics included daily steps, elevation gain, and activity durations at different intensities (e.g., very active, lightly active, and sedentary). Cox proportional hazards models and multiple regression models were used to assess the relationship between these metrics and the incidence of chronic diseases represented by Phecodes. Age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were included as covariates. A total of 15,538 participants provided Fitbit activity data, of which 9,320 also had electronic health records (EHR). Increased daily step count, elevation gain, and very active minutes were significantly associated with a reduced risk of several chronic conditions, including obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and major depressive disorder. Conversely, increased sedentary time was linked to higher risks for conditions such as obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and essential hypertension. Multiple regression analyses confirmed these associations. Our findings highlight the beneficial effects of increased physical activity, particularly daily steps and elevation gain, on reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Conversely, sedentary behavior remains a significant risk factor for the development of several conditions. These insights may inform personalized activity recommendations aimed at reducing disease burden and improving population health outcomes.","Hou, Yu; Cui, Erjia; Ikramuddin, Sayeed; Zhang, Rui",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024,,,,10.1101/2024.11.11.24317124

Area-level factors and intersectionality framework, which considers overlapping personal identities, are used in this paper to get a nuanced picture of depression disparities. This cross-sectional study uses electronic health records data from the All of Us research network. Our study cohort includes 20,042 individuals who completed the SDOH surveys in All of Us and had at least one in-patient visit, with 27.3% diagnosed with depression since 2020. We used depression diagnosis as an outcome, while independent variables include US Religious Census and American urvey responses, area-level variables, sociodemographic characteristics: age group, income, gender, sexual orientation, immigration status, marital status, and race/ethnicity - and the interactions of the latter with each other and with other variables. The association between depression diagnosis and the variables is reported by fitting the logistic regression model on the subset of variables identified by LASSO method. The analysis revealed that area-level indicators, such as religious adherence and childbirth rates, significantly influenced depression outcomes when interacting with personal identity variables: area-level religious adherence was associated with increased depression odds for women (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.15-1.54) and non-binary individuals (OR 3.70, 95% CI 1.03-13.31).

EHR-linked biobanks should report recruitment and selection mechanisms and provide selection weights with defined target populations. Researchers should consider their intended estimands, specify source and target populations, and weight EHR-linked biobank analyses accordingly.","Salvatore, Maxwell; Kundu, Ritoban; Shi, Xu; Friese, Christopher R; Lee, Seunggeun; Fritsche, Lars G; Mondul, Alison M; Hanauer, David; Pearce, Celeste Leigh; Mukherjee, Bhramar",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Humans; Electronic Health Records; Biological Specimen Banks; Selection Bias; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Medical Record Linkage; United States; Aged; United Kingdom; Michigan,ICD codes; biobank; electronic health records; phenome; selection bias,"Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Rogel Cancer Center, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Center for Improving Patient and Population Health, School of Nursing, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Health Management and Policy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Graduate School of Data Science, Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Rogel Cancer Center, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Rogel Cancer Center, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Learning Health Sciences, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2054, United States.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Rogel Cancer Center, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.",10.1093/jamia/ocae098
All of Us,40146917,"Biases in Race and Ethnicity Introduced by Filtering Electronic Health Records for ""Complete Data"": Observational Clinical Data Analysis.","Integrated clinical databases from national biobanks have advanced the capacity for disease research. Data quality and completeness filters are used when building clinical cohorts to address limitations of data missingness. However, these filters may unintentionally introduce systemic biases when they are correlated with race and ethnicity. In this study, we examined the race and ethnicity biases introduced by applying common filters to 4 clinical records databases. Specifically, we evaluated whether these filters introduce biases that disproportionately exclude minoritized groups. We applied 19 commonly used data filters to electronic health record datasets from 4 geographically varied locations comprising close to 12 million patients to understand how using these filters introduces sample bias along racial and ethnic groupings. These filters covered a range of information, including demographics, medication records, visit details, and observation periods. We observed the variation in sample drop-off between self-reported ethnic and racial groups for each site as we applied each filter individually. Applying the observation period filter substantially reduced data availability across all races and ethnicities in all 4 datasets. However, among those examined, the availability of data in the white group remained consistently higher compared to other racial groups after applying each filter. Conversely, the Black or African American group was the most impacted by each filter on these 3 datasets: Cedars-Sinai dataset, UK Biobank, and Columbia University dataset. Among the 4 distinct datasets, only applying the filters to the All of Us dataset resulted in minimal deviation from the baseline, with most racial and ethnic groups following a similar pattern. Our findings underscore the importance of using only necessary filters, as they might disproportionally affect data availability of minoritized racial and ethnic populations. Researchers must consider these unintentional biases when performing data-driven research and explore techniques to minimize the impact of these filters, such as probabilistic methods or adjusted cohort selection methods. Additionally, we recommend disclosing sample sizes for racial and ethnic groups both before and after data filters are applied to aid the reader in understanding the generalizability of the results. Future work should focus on exploring the effects of filters on downstream analyses.","Acitores Cortina, Jose Miguel; Fatapour, Yasaman; Brown, Kathleen LaRow; Gisladottir, Undina; Zietz, Michael; Bear Don't Walk Iv, Oliver John; Peter, Danner; Berkowitz, Jacob S; Friedrich, Nadine A; Kivelson, Sophia; Kuchi, Aditi; Liu, Hongyu; Srinivasan, Apoorva; Tsang, Kevin K; Tatonetti, Nicholas P",JMIR medical informatics,2025,"Humans; Electronic Health Records; Ethnicity; Racial Groups; Bias; Data Accuracy; Databases, Factual",data quality; electronic health records; health disparities; observational research; racial and ethnic biases,"Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.",10.2196/67591

However, data of its routine real-world use are limited, and evidence from Italian settings is lacking. The REAL.IT study aimed to characterize the demographics, pharmacotherapy, clinical characteristics and outcomes of sacubitril/valsartan-treated Italian patients with HFrEF. Electronic medical records of patients initiating sacubitril/valsartan from October 2016 to June 2019 at nine specialized hospital outpatient HF centers across Italy were reviewed. Overall, 924 adults (mean age 64.5 years, 84.6% male) were included. At baseline, 38.7% had an ischemic HF etiology, 45.9% hypertension, 23.2% atrial fibrillation, 25.4% diabetes mellitus, 26.1% an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and 31.9% coronary artery bypass grafting. There were no clear patterns of patient selection over time. During follow-up, NYHA class improved in 37.5% of patients after a mean of 5.3 ± 3.8 months; 36.1% and 16.7% of patients were in NYHA class III during characterization and after one year of follow-up, respectively. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved ≥5% in 56.3% of patients at one year; 39.7% had ≥30% reduction of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; 2.2% had hyperkalemia during characterization and 2.6% during follow-up; and 3.8% had hypotension during characterization and 12% during follow-up. A total of 50 (5.8%) of patients had device implantation (ICD/CRT) during follow-up. HF-related hospitalization was recorded in 19.6% of patients during follow-up; 3.8% of patients died, approximately 1.3% from cardiovascular causes.

All of Us,40124313,Artificial Intelligence Models to Identify Patients with High Probability of Glaucoma Using Electronic Health Records.,"Early detection of glaucoma allows for timely treatment to prevent severe vision loss, but screening requires resource-intensive examinations and imaging, which are challenging for large-scale implementation and evaluation. The purpose of this study was to develop artificial intelligence models that can utilize the wealth of data stored in electronic health records (EHRs) to identify patients who have high probability of developing glaucoma, without the use of any dedicated ophthalmic imaging or clinical data. Cohort study. A total of 64 735 participants who were ≥18 years of age and had ≥2 separate encounters with eye-related diagnoses recorded in their EHR records in the All of Us Research Program, a national multicenter cohort of patients contributing EHR and survey data, and who were enrolled from May 1, 2018, to July 1, 2022. We developed models to predict which patients had a diagnosis of glaucoma, using the following machine learning approaches: (1) penalized logistic regression, (2) XGBoost, and (3) a deep learning architecture that included a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and stacked autoencoders. Model input features included demographics and only the nonophthalmic lab results, measurements, medications, and diagnoses available from structured EHR data. Evaluation metrics included area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Of 64 735 patients, 7268 (11.22%) had a glaucoma diagnosis. Overall, AUROC ranged from 0.796 to 0.863. The 1D-CNN model achieved the highest performance with an AUROC score of 0.863 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.862-0.864). Investigation of 1D-CNN model performance stratified by race/ethnicity showed that AUROC ranged from 0.825 to 0.869 by subpopulation, with the highest performance of 0.869 (95% CI, 0.868-0.870) among the non-Hispanic White subpopulation. Machine and deep learning models were able to use the extensive systematic data within EHR to identify individuals with glaucoma, without the need for ophthalmic imaging or clinical data. These models could potentially automate identifying high-risk glaucoma patients in EHRs, aiding targeted screening referrals. Additional research is needed to investigate the impact of protected class characteristics such as race/ethnicity on model performance and fairness.

Stress-evoked inflammation is a hypothesized mechanism driving these associations. This study tested the association between food insecurity and inflammation in cancer survivors. Our sample included individuals with a history of lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer from the All of Us Research Program. Food insecurity was measured using validated questions, and inflammatory biomarkers were obtained from electronic health records (EHR). Our primary analysis tested the association between food insecurity and c-reactive protein (CRP; n=413) using multivariable regression models, controlling for sociodemographics and current cancer treatment. The primary cohort was 69.8 ± 9.5 years in age, 61.0% female, 89.3% non-Hispanic White, and 9.9% had food insecurity. A higher proportion of racial/ethnic minorities (40.8%) and individuals with lower annual household income (33.3%) and education (29.4%) had food insecurity. Mean CRP was higher among those with food insecurity (14.5 ± 18.5) than food secure individuals (10.4 ± 17.8), but it was not significantly associated with CRP in our fully adjusted models. Lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors had moderate levels of inflammation measured by CRP; however, food insecurity was not associated with CRP in fully adjusted models.

Sociodemographic factors among AR patients were compared via Chi-Square analysis and multivariable logistic regression (MLR). Subgroups of AR patients with or without nasal steroid spray or oral antihistamine listed in the electronic health record (EHR) were compared via chi-square analysis and MLR. 47,224 participants were identified with AR, an 11.6% estimated prevalence. AR patients were more commonly White (12.8% vs. 10.6%, p < 0.001), female (13.1% vs. 9.1%, p < 0.001), and older than 65 (14.7% vs. 7.6% vs. 11.6%, p < 0.001). MLR identified older age (OR 1.018, CI: 1.017-1.018), income > $35,000 (OR 1.035, CI: 1.021-1.049), finishing high school/college (OR 1.140, CI: 1.113-1.167; OR 1.113, CI: 1.085, 1.142), and health insurance coverage (OR 2.003, CI: 1.924-2.087) as predictive factors for AR. Patients with nasal steroid spray and/or oral antihistamine listed in the EHR were more commonly Black (OR 1.250, CI: 1.177-1.328; OR 1.491, CI: 1.398-1.590) and had an income < $35,000 (OR 0.856, CI: 0.814-0.900; OR 0.724, CI: 0.687-0.764). AR patients were more likely to be insured, while oral antihistamines/nasal steroid spray listed in the EHR were associated with lower income and Black race.

In Hispanic adults, HF is underdiagnosed, leading to an incomplete characterization of the HF risk profiles in this population. Thus, the objective of the study was to investigate the multidimension HF risk factors among Hispanic adults. This cross-sectional study analyzed observational data collected from Hispanic adult participants in the All of Us Research Program. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, environmental, stress, and health care access and utilization data were retrieved from the survey domain. Past medical history was retrieved from the electronic health record domain. Using SAS, logistic regression was performed to identify multidimension risk factors for HF in Hispanic adults. The study subjects consisted of 5,281 Hispanic adults with 72.5% females and 27.5% males. The prevalence of HF was 3.6% (188/5,281). Males had a higher prevalence of HF than females (5.7% vs 2.7%). After adjusting for potential confounders with logistic regression, age (OR = 1.03, 95% CI [1.01, 1.04], p <0.0001), hypertension (OR = 5.75, 95% CI [3.23, 10.24], p <0.0001), heart attack (OR = 11.31, 95% CI [7.71, 16.58], p <0.0001), type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.45, 95% CI [1.02, 2.06], p = 0.0383), and obesity (OR = 2.32, 95% CI [1.60, 3.36], p <0.0001) were significant risk factors for HF. In conclusion, multidimension risk factors for HF among Hispanic adults were explored in this study.

All of Us,38183082,Machine learning approaches to identify systemic lupus erythematosus in anti-nuclear antibody-positive patients using genomic data and electronic health records.,"Although the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has required at least a positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer (≥ 1:80), it remains challenging for clinicians to identify patients with SLE. This study aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) approach to assist in the detection of SLE patients using genomic data and electronic health records. Participants with a positive ANA (≥ 1:80) were enrolled from the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative cohort. The Taiwan Biobank version 2 array was used to detect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. Six ML models, Logistic Regression, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Gradient Tree Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were used to identify SLE patients. The importance of the clinical and genetic features was determined by Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values. A logistic regression model was applied to identify genetic variations associated with SLE in the subset of patients with an ANA equal to or exceeding 1:640. A total of 946 SLE and 1,892 non-SLE controls were included in this analysis. Among the six ML models, RF and XGB demonstrated superior performance in the differentiation of SLE from non-SLE. The leading features in the SHAP diagram were anti-double strand DNA antibodies, ANA titers, AC4 ANA pattern, polygenic risk scores, complement levels, and SNPs. Additionally, in the subgroup with a high ANA titer (≥ 1:640), six SNPs positively associated with SLE and five SNPs negatively correlated with SLE were discovered. ML approaches offer the potential to assist in diagnosing SLE and uncovering novel SNPs in a group of patients with autoimmunity.","Chung, Chih-Wei; Chou, Seng-Cho; Hsiao, Tzu-Hung; Zhang, Grace Joyce; Chung, Yu-Fang; Chen, Yi-Ming",BioData mining,2024,,Anti-nuclear antibody; Machine learning; Polygenic risk score; Single nucleotide polymorphism; Systemic lupus erythematosus,"Department of Information Management, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Information Management, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Public Health, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City, Taiwan.; Institute of Genomics and Bioinformatics, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. ymchen1@vghtc.gov.tw.; Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, 1650, Section 4, Taiwan Boulevard, Xitun Dist., Taichung City, 407, Taiwan. ymchen1@vghtc.gov.tw.; Department of Post-Baccalaureate Medicine, College of Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan. ymchen1@vghtc.gov.tw.; School of Medicine, College of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan. ymchen1@vghtc.gov.tw.; Rong Hsing Research Center for Translational Medicine & Ph.D. Program in Translational Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan. ymchen1@vghtc.gov.tw.; Precision Medicine Research Center, College of Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan. ymchen1@vghtc.gov.tw.",10.1186/s13040-023-00352-y
All of Us,34499048,Tablet-Based Cognitive Impairment Screening for Adults With HIV Seeking Clinical Care: Observational Study.,"Neurological complications including cognitive impairment persist among people with HIV on antiretrovirals; however, cognitive screening is not routinely conducted in HIV clinics. Our objective for this study was 3-fold: (1) to determine the feasibility of implementing an iPad-based cognitive impairment screener among adults seeking HIV care, (2) to examine the psychometric properties of the tool, and (3) to examine predictors of cognitive impairment using the tool. A convenience sample of participants completed Brain Baseline Assessment of Cognition and Everyday Functioning (BRACE), which included (1) Trail Making Test Part A, measuring psychomotor speed; (2) Trail Making Test Part B, measuring set-shifting; (3) Stroop Color, measuring processing speed; and (4) the Visual-Spatial Learning Test. Global neuropsychological function was estimated as mean T score performance on the 4 outcomes. Impairment on each test or for the global mean was defined as a T score ≤40. Subgroups of participants repeated the tests 4 weeks or >6 months after completing the first test to evaluate intraperson test-retest reliability and practice effects (improvements in performance due to repeated test exposure). An additional subgroup completed a lengthier cognitive battery concurrently to assess validity. Relevant factors were abstracted from electronic medical records to examine predictors of global neuropsychological function. The study population consisted of 404 people with HIV (age: mean 53.6 years; race: 332/404, 82% Black; 34/404, 8% White, 10/404, 2% American Indian/Alaskan Native; 28/404, 7% other and 230/404, 58% male; 174/404, 42% female) of whom 99% (402/404) were on antiretroviral therapy. Participants completed BRACE in a mean of 12 minutes (SD 3.2), and impairment was demonstrated by 34% (136/404) on Trail Making Test A, 44% (177/404) on Trail Making Test B, 40% (161/404) on Stroop Color, and 17% (67/404) on Visual-Spatial Learning Test. Global impairment was demonstrated by 103 out of 404 (25%). Test-retest reliability for the subset of participants (n=26) repeating the measure at 4 weeks was 0.81 and for the subset of participants (n=67) repeating the measure almost 1 year later (days: median 294, IQR 50) was 0.63. There were no significant practice effects at either time point (P=.20 and P=.68, respectively). With respect for validity, the correlation between global impairment on the lengthier cognitive battery and BRACE was 0.63 (n=61; P<.001), with 84% sensitivity and 94% specificity to impairment on the lengthier cognitive battery. We were able to successfully implement BRACE and estimate cognitive impairment burden in the context of routine clinic care. BRACE was also shown to have good psychometric properties. This easy-to-use tool in clinical settings may facilitate the care needs of people with HIV as cognitive impairment continues to remain a concern in people with HIV.","Rubin, Leah H; Severson, Joan; Marcotte, Thomas D; Savin, Micah J; Best, Allen; Johnson, Shane; Cosman, Joshua; Merickel, Michael; Buchholz, Alison; Del Bene, Victor A; Eldred, Lois; Sacktor, Ned C; Fuchs, Joelle-Beverlie; Althoff, Keri N; Moore, Richard D",JMIR mental health,2021,,HIV; cognitive complications; digital assessment; people with HIV; screening; tablet,"Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Digital Artefacts LLC, Iowa City, IA, United States.; University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States.; Fordham University, Bronx, NY, United States.; Digital Artefacts LLC, Iowa City, IA, United States.; Digital Artefacts LLC, Iowa City, IA, United States.; Abbvie, Inc, Chicago, IL, United States.; Digital Artefacts LLC, Iowa City, IA, United States.; Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.; University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.; Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.; Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States.",10.2196/25660
All of Us,35927974,Keeping synthetic patients on track: feedback mechanisms to mitigate performance drift in longitudinal health data simulation.,"Synthetic data are increasingly relied upon to share electronic health record (EHR) data while maintaining patient privacy. Current simulation methods can generate longitudinal data, but the results are unreliable for several reasons. First, the synthetic data drifts from the real data distribution over time. Second, the typical approach to quality assessment, which is based on the extent to which real records can be distinguished from synthetic records using a critic model, often fails to recognize poor simulation results. In this article, we introduce a longitudinal simulation framework, called LS-EHR, which addresses these issues. LS-EHR enhances simulation through conditional fuzzing and regularization, rejection sampling, and prior knowledge embedding. We compare LS-EHR to the state-of-the-art using data from 60 000 EHRs from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and the All of Us Research Program. We assess discrimination between real and synthetic data over time. We evaluate the generation process and critic model using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). For the critic, a higher value indicates a more robust model for quality assessment. For the generation process, a lower value indicates better synthetic data quality. The LS-EHR critic improves discrimination AUROC from 0.655 to 0.909 and 0.692 to 0.918 for VUMC and All of Us data, respectively. By using the new critic, the LS-EHR generation model reduces the AUROC from 0.909 to 0.758 and 0.918 to 0.806. LS-EHR can substantially improve the usability of simulated longitudinal EHR data.","Zhang, Ziqi; Yan, Chao; Malin, Bradley A",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2022,Computer Simulation; Electronic Health Records; Feedback; Humans; Population Health,electronic health records (EHRs); generative adversarial networks (GANs); longitudinal simulation; privacy; synthetic data,"Department of Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.",10.1093/jamia/ocac131

PS weights were calculated to align a health system-based biobank, the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI; n = 76,757), with a nationally recruited biobank, All of Us (AOU; n = 226,764), which oversamples underrepresented groups. Basic PS weights (PS Elastic net and random forest methods generally performed well in risk stratification, but no single PheRS construction method consistently outperformed others. Applying PS weights did not consistently improve risk stratification performance. For example, in liver cancer risk stratification at t = 1, unweighted random forest PheRS yielded an OR of 13.73 (95 % CI: 8.97, 21.01), compared to 14.55 (95 % CI: 9.45, 22.42) with PS PS weights do not significantly enhance risk model transferability between biobanks.

We sought to compare the risk of liver transplantation associated with hepatitis C infection with AATD heterozygotes and homozygotes and determine if SERPINA1 sequencing would identify undiagnosed AATD. We performed a retrospective cohort study in a deidentified Electronic Health Record (EHR)-linked DNA biobank with 72,027 individuals genotyped for the M, Z, and S alleles in SERPINA1. We investigated liver transplantation frequency by genotype group and compared with hepatitis C infection. We performed SERPINA1 sequencing in carriers of pathogenic AATD alleles who underwent liver transplantation. Liver transplantation was associated with the Z allele (ZZ: odds ratio [OR] = 1.31, p<2e-16; MZ: OR = 1.02, p = 1.2e-13) and with hepatitis C (OR = 1.20, p<2e-16). For liver transplantation, there was a significant interaction between genotype and hepatitis C (ZZ: interaction OR = 1.23, p = 4.7e-4; MZ: interaction OR = 1.11, p = 6.9e-13). Sequencing uncovered a second, rare, pathogenic SERPINA1 variant in six of 133 individuals with liver transplants and without hepatitis C. Liver transplantation was more common in individuals with AATD risk alleles (including heterozygotes), and AATD and hepatitis C demonstrated evidence of a gene-environment interaction in relation to liver transplantation. The current AATD screening strategy may miss diagnoses whereas SERPINA1 sequencing may increase diagnostic yield for AATD, stratify risk for liver disease, and inform clinical management for individuals with AATD risk alleles and liver disease risk factors.","Schuler, Bryce A; Bastarache, Lisa; Wang, Janey; He, Jing; Van Driest, Sara L; Denny, Joshua C",PloS one,2023,"Humans; Alleles; Gene-Environment Interaction; Retrospective Studies; alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency; Hepatitis C; Hepacivirus; Genetics, Population; alpha 1-Antitrypsin",,"Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; All of Us Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.",10.1371/journal.pone.0286469

This cross-sectional study used a national sample from the All of Us Research Program, which included over 80 % of participants from underrepresented populations in biomedical research. Study participants included adults aged 18 years and older diagnosed with OSA (N = 8518). Diagnosis of OSA and CPAP treatment were ascertained by diagnostic and procedural codes from the electronic health records. Sociodemographic characteristics and health service utilization factors were identified using self-reported survey data. With this national survey, the overall diagnosed prevalence of OSA was 8.8 %, with rates of 8.12 % in non-Hispanic (NH) Black adults, 5.99 % in Hispanic adults, and 10.35 % in NH White adults. When comparing to NH White adults, Hispanic adults were less likely to receive CPAP treatment for OSA after adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, access to and utilization of health services, and comorbidities such as obesity and having multiple chronic conditions (OR = 0.73, 95 % CI = 0.59,0.90), p < 0.01. The rates of CPAP treatment among OSA patients are not consistent across racial and ethnic groups. Unequal access to health services based on residence may contribute to these differences.

All of Us,39670849,Association Between Alcohol Use and Primary Open Angle Glaucoma.,"In a diverse database ( All of Us ), we report significant dose-response associations between alcohol use frequency and glaucoma, with alcohol use of 4 or more drinks per week associated with significantly increased odds of glaucoma. Current evidence on the association between alcohol use and primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is mixed. We utilize the diverse All of Us Research Program to further examine this relationship. This is a retrospective cohort study using the diverse All of Us Research Program, a nationwide effort by the United States National Institutes of Health to recruit those historically under-represented in biomedical research. Electronic health records and survey data from the All of Us program were analyzed. A randomized 1:4 case/control ratio was utilized for POAG patients and randomly selected control patients. χ 2 , bivariable, and multivariable regression were utilized to examine the associations between alcohol use and POAG. Of the 3876 POAG patients, 2015 (52%) were female, 1943 (50%) were White, 1152 (30%) were Black, 117 (3%) were Asian, and 584 (15%) were Hispanic. Alcohol use of 4 or more drinks per week was significantly higher in the glaucoma cohort relative to controls (15% vs. 12%, P <0.001). On bivariate analysis, diagnosed alcohol misuse was associated with higher odds of POAG [odds ratio (OR): 1.20, 95% CI: 1.17-1.23, P <0.001]. In multivariable regression, more frequent alcohol use was associated with higher odds of glaucoma; alcohol use with a frequency of 4 or more drinks per week was significantly associated with increased odds of glaucoma (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03-1.44, P =0.023). This dose-response relationship was also observed and more pronounced for female participants, where alcohol use frequency of monthly or less was already associated with increased odds of glaucoma (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.002-1.46, P =0.048). In the diverse All of Us database, there was a dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption and POAG risk, which was more pronounced in female participants. Overall, a higher frequency of alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of POAG; 4 or more drinks per week significantly was associated with higher glaucoma risk.","Meller, Leo L T; Saseendrakumar, Bharanidharan Radha; Mahmoudinezhad, Golnoush; Tavakoli, Kiana; Wu, Jo-Hsuan; Parikh, Aman; Bhanvadia, Sonali; Moghimi, Sasan; Zangwill, Linda; Weinreb, Robert N; Baxter, Sally L",Journal of glaucoma,2025,"Humans; Female; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Male; Retrospective Studies; Alcohol Drinking; Middle Aged; Intraocular Pressure; Aged; United States; Risk Factors; Adult; Databases, Factual",,"Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Hamilton Glaucoma Research Center and Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, University of California San Diego.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Hamilton Glaucoma Research Center and Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, University of California San Diego.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Hamilton Glaucoma Research Center and Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, University of California San Diego.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Hamilton Glaucoma Research Center and Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, University of California San Diego.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Hamilton Glaucoma Research Center and Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, University of California San Diego.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Hamilton Glaucoma Research Center and Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, University of California San Diego.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Hamilton Glaucoma Research Center and Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, University of California San Diego.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Hamilton Glaucoma Research Center and Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, University of California San Diego.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Hamilton Glaucoma Research Center and Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, University of California San Diego.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Hamilton Glaucoma Research Center and Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, University of California San Diego.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Hamilton Glaucoma Research Center and Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, University of California San Diego.; UCSD Health Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.",10.1097/IJG.0000000000002529
All of Us,40240721,Discrimination and Mental Health Among Black and Latino People Living with HIV: Understanding the Role of Religion and Spirituality.,"Despite significant advances in HIV care and treatment, Black and Latino people living with HIV (PWH) still face substantial health disparities due to discrimination and systemic inequities, which adversely affect their mental health. Given the profound significance of religion and spirituality in Black and Latino communities, the effects of religiosity on the relationship between discrimination and mental health should be examined. This study examined religiosity as a moderator between discrimination and mental health among Black and Latino PWH. Using data from the All of Us Research Program collected from 2016 to 2022, we analyzed electronic health records and survey responses from 902 participants, employing descriptive statistics, Chi-squared test, principal component analysis, and binary logistic regression. Results showed significant associations between education, employment, income, discrimination, religiosity, and mental health. Compared with no or low religiosity, those with high religiosity had significant higher odds of good mental health (aOR:2.35, 95% CI:1.16-4.75). Those who experienced discrimination had 59% lower odds of good mental health compared to those who did not report experiences of discrimination (aOR:0.41, 95% CI:0.20-0.83). There was no significant interaction effect of religiosity on the relationship between discrimination and mental health. While religiosity positively influences mental health, it does not mitigate the detrimental effects of compounded discrimination that Black and Latino PWH face. Continued collaborations between religious and spiritual leaders, researchers, and community members is needed to understand better the relationship between these factors and to identify strategies to maximize the protective effect of religiosity. Este estudio examinó la religiosidad como moderador entre la discriminación y la salud mental entre las personas negras y latinas con VIH (PCH). Utilizando datos del Programa All of Us recopilados entre 2016 y 2022, analizamos los registros electrónicos de salud y las respuestas a encuestas de 902 participantes, empleando estadística descriptiva, prueba de Chi-cuadrado, análisis de componentes principales y regresión logística binaria. Los resultados mostraron asociaciones significativas entre la educación, los ingresos, la discriminación, la religiosidad y la salud mental. En comparación con la religiosidad nula o baja, aquellos con religiosidad alta tenían probabilidades significativamente más altas de buena salud mental (aOR: 2.35, IC 95%: 1.16– 4.75). Aquellos que experimentaron discriminación tenían un 59% menos de probabilidades de buena salud mental en comparación con aquellos que no informaron experiencias de discriminación (aOR: 0.41, IC 95%: 0.20–0.3). No hubo un efecto significativo de la interacción de la religiosidad en la relación entre la discriminación y la salud mental. Si bien la religiosidad influye positivamente en la salud mental, no mitiga los efectos perjudiciales de la discriminación agravada que enfrentan las personas negras y latinas.","Lane, Brittany L; Sabuncu, Crim; Yang, Yijiong; Okantey, Beth; Campbell, Daryl N; Bryant, Ty-Runet; Sorkpor, Setor; Millender, Eugenia; Wong, Frankie Y; Hall, Casey D Xavier",AIDS and behavior,2025,,Depression; Discrimination; HIV; Intersectionality; Religion,"College of Nursing, Florida State University, 2010 Levy Avenue, Innovation Park, Building B, Suite 3600, Tallahassee, FL, USA. blane2@fsu.edu.; Center of Population Sciences for Health Equity, College of Nursing, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA. blane2@fsu.edu.; College of Social Work, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; College of Nursing, Florida State University, 2010 Levy Avenue, Innovation Park, Building B, Suite 3600, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; College of Social Work, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; Voice Unplugged, Tamarac, FL, USA.; Community Health Science and Policy, Health Sciences Center, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University, New Orleans, LA, USA.; College of Nursing, Florida State University, 2010 Levy Avenue, Innovation Park, Building B, Suite 3600, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; College of Nursing, Florida State University, 2010 Levy Avenue, Innovation Park, Building B, Suite 3600, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; Center of Population Sciences for Health Equity, College of Nursing, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; College of Social Work, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; College of Nursing, Florida State University, 2010 Levy Avenue, Innovation Park, Building B, Suite 3600, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; Center of Population Sciences for Health Equity, College of Nursing, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; College of Social Work, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; College of Nursing, Florida State University, 2010 Levy Avenue, Innovation Park, Building B, Suite 3600, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; Center of Population Sciences for Health Equity, College of Nursing, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; College of Social Work, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA.",10.1007/s10461-025-04720-z

All of Us,40386402,Association of Physical Activity from Wearable Devices and Chronic Disease Risk: Insights from the All of Us Research Program.,"Physical activity is a modifiable factor influencing chronic disease risk. Previous studies often relied on self-reported activity measures or short-term assessments, limiting their accuracy. Leveraging Fitbit-derived data from the All of Us Research Program, we investigated associations between long-term physical activity patterns and chronic disease incidence in a diverse cohort. The study included 22,019 participants with at least six months of Fitbit monitoring and linked electronic health records. Key activity metrics included daily step count, activity calories, elevation gain, and activity duration at different intensities. Higher physical activity levels were associated with a lower risk of multiple chronic diseases. A 2,000-step increase in daily step count was linked to a reduced risk of obesity (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80-0.90), type 2 diabetes (HR = 0.78, CI: 0.72-0.84), and major depressive disorder (HR = 0.83, CI: 0.77-0.90). Elevation gain was inversely associated with obesity (HR = 0.86, CI: 0.78-0.95) and type 2 diabetes (HR = 0.65, CI: 0.53-0.80). Increased time spent in very active intensity correlated with a lower risk of multiple conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea and morbid obesity. Conversely, prolonged sedentary time was associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases, including obesity (HR = 1.08, CI: 1.06-1.10) and essential hypertension (HR = 1.05, CI: 1.04-1.07). A sensitivity analysis using BMI-defined obesity instead of EHR-based diagnoses confirmed the robustness of these associations. These findings underscore the protective role of increased physical activity and reduced sedentary time in mitigating chronic disease risk. They support the development of personalized physical activity recommendations and targeted public health interventions aimed at improving long-term health outcomes. Future research integrating machine learning approaches could further refine activity-based disease prevention strategies.","Zhang, Rui; Hou, Yu; Cui, Erjia; Lim, Kelvin; Chow, Lisa; Howell, Michael; Ikramuddin, Sayeed",Research square,2025,,,"University of Minnesota.; University of Minnesota.; University of Minnesota, Division of Biostatistics.; University of Minnesota.; University of Minnesota.; University of Minnesota.; University of Minnesota.",10.21203/rs.3.rs-6263507/v1
All of Us,35668420,"Observational study of population genomic screening for variants associated with endocrine tumor syndromes in a large, healthcare-based cohort.","In current care, patients' personal and self-reported family histories are primarily used to determine whether genetic testing for hereditary endocrine tumor syndromes (ETS) is indicated. Population genomic screening for other conditions has increased ascertainment of individuals with pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants, leading to improved management and earlier diagnoses. It is unknown whether such benefits occur when screening broader populations for P/LP ETS variants. This manuscript assesses clinical utility outcomes of a large, unselected, healthcare-based genomic screening program by describing personal and family history of syndrome-related features, risk management behaviors after result disclosure, and rates of relevant post-disclosure diagnoses in patient-participants with P/LP ETS variants. Observational study of individuals informed of a P/LP variant in MEN1, RET, SDHAF2, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, or VHL through Geisinger's MyCode Community Health Initiative between June 2016 and October 2019. Electronic health records (EHRs) of participants were evaluated for a report of pre-disclosure personal and self-reported family histories and post-disclosure risk management and diagnoses. P/LP variants in genes of interest were identified in 199 of 130,490 (1 in 656) adult Geisinger MyCode patient-participants, 80 of which were disclosed during the study period. Eighty-one percent (n = 65) did not have prior evidence of the result in their EHR and, because they were identified via MyCode, were included in further analyses. Five participants identified via MyCode (8%) had a personal history of syndrome-related features; 16 (25%) had a positive self-reported family history. Time from result disclosure to EHR review was a median of 0.7 years. Post-disclosure, 36 (55.4%) completed a recommended risk management behavior; 11 (17%) were diagnosed with a syndrome-related neoplasm after completing a risk management intervention. Broader screening for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants associated with endocrine tumor syndromes enables detection of at-risk individuals, leads to the uptake of risk management, and facilitates relevant diagnoses. Further research will be necessary to continue to determine the clinical utility of screening diverse, unselected populations for such variants.","Savatt, Juliann M; Ortiz, Nicole M; Thone, Gretchen M; McDonald, Whitney S; Kelly, Melissa A; Berry, Alexander S F; Alvi, Madiha M; Hallquist, Miranda L G; Malinowski, Jennifer; Purdy, Nicholas C; Williams, Marc S; Sturm, Amy C; Buchanan, Adam H",BMC medicine,2022,Adult; Delivery of Health Care; Genetic Testing; Humans; Metagenomics; Neoplasms; Syndrome,Genomic screening; MEN 1; MEN 2; Medullary thyroid cancer; Paraganglioma; Succinate dehydrogenase; VHL,"Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA. jmsavatt@geisinger.edu.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.; Autism & Developmental Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Lewisburg, PA, USA.; Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.; Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, PA, USA.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.; Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, PA, USA.; Otolaryngology, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.; Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, PA, USA.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.; Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, PA, USA.; Heart and Vascular Institute, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Danville, PA, USA.; Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, PA, USA.",10.1186/s12916-022-02375-4

To characterize missing data among glaucoma patients within All of Us . We used diagnosis codes to define cohorts of primary glaucoma patients with and without severity staging specified. Descriptive analyses were conducted by presence of disease severity stage. Analysis of missing data was conducted using a set intersection plot and the Little Test of Missing Completely at Random. T tests were performed to evaluate differences. Of 2982 participants, 1714 (57%) did not have glaucoma severity stage specified, and 11 of 23 analyzed variables had missing data. The Little Test indicated data was not missing completely at random ( P <0.001). Significant differences existed between the 2 cohorts with respect to age, age of first glaucoma diagnosis, gender, ethnicity, education, income, insurance, history of glaucoma surgery and medication use, and answers regarding the ability to afford eyeglasses and having seen an eye care provider in the last 12 months (all P- values ≤0.01). There were significant differences between glaucoma participants with glaucoma severity stage specified versus those with unstaged disease across multiple socioeconomic characteristics and self-reported barriers to care. Glaucoma severity staging data was not missing completely at random. The unstaged cohort included higher rates of multiple underrepresented communities, which may potentially contribute to bias in ophthalmology research as participants from vulnerable populations may be disproportionately excluded from electronic health records or claims data studies where diagnosis codes with severity/staging levels are used to examine risk factors for disease, progression, and treatment efficacy.","Acuff, Kaela N; Radha Saseendrakumar, Bharanidharan; Weinreb, Robert N; Baxter, Sally L",Journal of glaucoma,2025,"Humans; Male; United States; Female; National Institutes of Health (U.S.); Aged; Middle Aged; Severity of Illness Index; Glaucoma; Databases, Factual; Intraocular Pressure; Adult; Socioeconomic Factors; Health Services Accessibility; Aged, 80 and over",,"Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, Hamilton Glaucoma Center, University of California San Diego.; Health Sciences Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, Hamilton Glaucoma Center, University of California San Diego.; Health Sciences Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, Hamilton Glaucoma Center, University of California San Diego.; Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology and Shiley Eye Institute, Division of Ophthalmology Informatics and Data Science, Hamilton Glaucoma Center, University of California San Diego.; Health Sciences Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.",10.1097/IJG.0000000000002480
All of Us,40539265,Predicting Weight Loss After Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy Using a Whole-genome Sequencing-derived Polygenic Risk Score in the All of Us Cohort.,"To create a genome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS) to improve prediction of a 12-month percent weight-loss (WL) following vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). Variability in post VSG WL is not well explained by clinical factors. The All of Us program provides access to a 414,830 short-read whole-genome sequencing (srWGS) resource enabling unbiased discovery of genetic predictors following VSG. VSG counts, demographic, anthropomorphic and vital sign information were obtained from the linked electronic health record (EHR). The discovery cohort (DC) included participants from version 7 carried into version 8 while the validation cohort (VC) included those newly added to v8. We defined good responders and non-responders as having WL±1SD from the mean. Following quality filtering we applied a two-stage penalized-regression followed by elastic-net logistic regression to identify 1,583 stable variants and derive β-weights. We then tested this PRS on the DC into a prediction model. We identified 395 participants in the DC and 336 participants in the VC, respectively. Of these VSG, 44 were classified as good responders (≥37% WL) and 55 as non-responders (≤19% WL). In the VC, 55 were classified as good responders and 48 as non-responders. Adding the PRS to models to clinical predictors increased the AUC following logistic regression by 0.03; P<4.3×10⁻¹⁴, random forest by 0.03; P<9.1×10⁻⁷, decision tree by 0.05; P=1.2×10⁻³, and gradient boosting by 0.08; P<8.3×10⁻¹⁰. Use of srWGS from AoU can be effectively used to generate PRS to enhance predictive WL accuracy.

All of Us,40068169,Assessing the Data Quality Dimensions of Partial and Complete Mastectomy Cohorts in the ,"Breast cancer is prevalent among females in the United States. Nonmetastatic disease is treated by partial or complete mastectomy procedures. However, the rates of those procedures vary across practices. Generating real-world evidence on breast cancer surgery could lead to improved and consistent practices. We investigated the quality of data from the All of Us Research Program, which is a precision medicine initiative that collected real-world electronic health care data from different sites in the United States both retrospectively and prospectively to participant enrollment. The paper aims to determine whether All of Us data are fit for use in generating real-world evidence on mastectomy procedures. Our mastectomy phenotype consisted of adult female participants who had CPT4 (Current Procedural Terminology 4), ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) procedure, or SNOMED (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine) codes for a partial or complete mastectomy procedure that mapped to Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model concepts. We evaluated the phenotype with a data quality dimensions (DQD) framework that consisted of 5 elements: conformance, completeness, concordance, plausibility, and temporality. Also, we applied a previously developed DQD checklist to evaluate concept selection, internal verification, and external validation for each dimension. We compared the DQD of our cohort to a control group of adult women who did not have a mastectomy procedure. Our subgroup analysis compared partial to complete mastectomy procedure phenotypes. There were 4175 female participants aged 18 years or older in the partial or complete mastectomy cohort, and 168,226 participants in the control cohort. The geospatial distribution of our cohort varied across states. For example, our cohort consisted of 835 (20%) participants from Massachusetts, but multiple other states contributed fewer than 20 participants. We compared the sociodemographic characteristics of the partial (n=2607) and complete (n=1568) mastectomy subgroups. Those groups differed in the distribution of age at procedure (P<.001), education (P=.02), and income (P=.03) levels, as per χ2 analysis. A total of 367 (9.9%) participants in our cohort had overlapping CPT4 and SNOMED codes for a mastectomy, and 63 (1.5%) had overlapping ICD-9 procedure and SNOMED codes. The prevalence of breast cancer-related concepts was higher in our cohort compared to the control group (P<.001). In both the partial and complete mastectomy subgroups, the correlations among concepts were consistent with the clinical management of breast cancer. The median time between biopsy and mastectomy was 5.5 (IQR 3.5-11.2) weeks.

Before the drug approval from the Italian National Regulatory Agency, a compassionate use programme has been run in Italy. This retrospective study aimed to analyse data from the first series of patients treated with lenvatinib in Italy. The primary aim was to assess the response rate (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end-points include overall survival (OS) and toxicity data. From November 2014 to September 2016, 94 patients were treated in 16 Italian sites. Seventeen percent of patients had one or more comorbidities, hypertension being the most common (60%). Ninety-eight percent of patients were treated by surgery, followed by RAI in 98% of cases. Sixty-four percent of patients received a previous systemic treatment. Lenvatinib was started at 24 mg in 64 subjects. Partial response and stable disease were observed in 36% and in 41% of subjects, respectively; progression was recorded in 14% of patients. Drug-related side-effects were common; the most common were fatigue (13.6%) and hypertension (11.6%). Overall, median PFS and OS were 10.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.7-12.6) and 23.8 months (95% CI, 19.7-25.0) respectively. Lenvatinib is active and safe in unselected, RAI-refractory, progressive DTC patients in real-life setting. RR and PFS seem to be less favourable than those observed in the SELECT trial, likely due to a negative selection that included heavily pretreated patients or with poor performance status.","Locati, L D; Piovesan, A; Durante, C; Bregni, M; Castagna, M G; Zovato, S; Giusti, M; Ibrahim, T; Puxeddu, E; Fedele, G; Pellegriti, G; Rinaldi, G; Giuffrida, D; Verderame, F; Bertolini, F; Bergamini, C; Nervo, A; Grani, G; Rizzati, S; Morelli, S; Puliafito, I; Elisei, R","European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2019,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Differentiation; Compassionate Use Trials; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Iodine Radioisotopes; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Safety; Phenylurea Compounds; Progression-Free Survival; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Quinolines; Radiation Tolerance; Radiopharmaceuticals; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Thyroid Neoplasms; Time Factors; Young Adult",Lenvatinib; RAI refractory; Real life; Thyroid cancer,"Head and Neck Medical Oncology; Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, Italy.

All of Us,37569411,Effects of Human Leukocyte Antigen DRB1 Genetic Polymorphism on Anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (ANTI-CCP) and Rheumatoid Factor (RF) Expression in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Patients.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic disease characterized by non-infectious inflammation of the joints and surrounding tissues, which can cause severe health problems, affect the patient's daily life, and even cause death. RA can be clinically diagnosed by the occurrence of blood serological markers, rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP). However, about 20% of RA patients exhibit negative results for both markers, which makes RA diagnosis difficult and, therefore, may delay the effective treatment. Previous studies found some evidence that human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-related genes might be the susceptibility genes for RA and their polymorphisms might contribute to varieties of susceptibility and disease severity. This study aimed for the genetic polymorphisms of the RA patient genome and their effects on the RA patient's serological makers, RF and anti-CCP. A total of 4580 patients' electronic medical records from 1992 to 2020 were retrieved from the China Medical University Hospital database. The most representative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) validation using the blood from 30 additional RA patients. The results showed significant changes at the position of chromosome 6 with rs9270481 being the most significant locus, which indicated the location of the HLA-DRB1 gene. Further, patients with the CC genotype at this locus were more likely to exhibit negative results for RF and anti-CCP than those with the TT genotype. The C allele was also more likely to be associated with negative results for RF and anti-CCP. The results demonstrated that a genetic polymorphism at rs9270481 affected the expression of RF and anti-CCP in RA patients, which might indicate the necessity to develop a personalized treatment plan for each individual patient based on the genetic profile.","Chen, Yu-Chia; Huang, Chung-Ming; Liu, Ting-Yuan; Wu, Ning; Chan, Chia-Jung; Shih, Peng-Yu; Chen, Hsin-Han; Chen, Shih-Yin; Tsai, Fuu-Jen",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,,anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody; genome-wide association study (GWAS); human leukocyte antigen DRB1; phenome-wide association studies (PheWASs); rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatoid factor,"Million-Person Precision Medicine Initiative, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan.; Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan.; School of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan.; Million-Person Precision Medicine Initiative, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan.; Department of Biological Sciences, Southeastern Oklahoma State University, Durant, OK 74701, USA.; Genetics Center, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan.; Genetics Center, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan.; Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan.; School of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan.; Genetics Center, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan.; School of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan.; Genetics Center, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan.; Department of Medical Genetics, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung 404, Taiwan.",10.3390/ijms241512036

Commonly suggested sources of improved health information are electronic health records (EHRs) and medical claims data. These data sources are collectively known as real world data (RWD) because they are generated from routine health care processes, and they are available for millions of patients. It is clear that RWD can provide estimates that are more timely and less expensive to produce- but a key question is whether or not they are very accurate. To test this, we took advantage of a unique health data source that includes a full range of sociodemographic variables and compare estimates using all of those potential weighting variables, versus estimates derived when only age and sex are available for weighting (as is common with most RWD sources). We show that not accounting for other variables can produce misleading, and quite inaccurate, health estimates.","Marker, David A; Hilton, Charity; Zelko, Jacob; Duke, Jon; Rolka, Deborah; Kaufmann, Rachel; Boyd, Richard",Journal of survey statistics and methodology,2024,,All of Us; bias; data defect correlation; diabetes; electronic health records (EHRs); nonprobability surveys,"Marker Consulting, Columbia, Maryland, United States of America.; Georgia Tech Research Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.; Georgia Tech Research Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.; Georgia Tech Research Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.; National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.; National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.; Georgia Tech Research Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.",10.1093/jssam/smae036
All of Us,40186349,Area Deprivation and Clinical Biomarkers of Inflammation in Cancer Survivors of the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program.,"High neighborhood deprivation is linked to increased cancer and overall mortality. Prior studies demonstrated higher inflammation in people from high deprivation areas. The area deprivation index (ADI) is a composite measure of income, education, employment, and housing, which quantifies neighborhood deprivation. We used the All of Us dataset to test whether inflammation, measured via c-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), differs by ADI in cancer survivors. Our sample included individuals with a history of lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, filtered for the presence of the inflammatory biomarkers. We used quartiles of ADI based on 3-digit zip code and biomarkers from electronic health records. We estimated the association between ADI and inflammation using adjusted logistic regression (n = 690 for CRP; n = 4242 for albumin; n = 5183 for NLR). The sample had a mean age of 66.2 ± 10.1 years, 63.0% were female, and 86.8% were White. Mean CRP (11.5 ± 17.5 mg/L) and NLR (3.6 ± 2.2) indicated moderate to high inflammation. In the fully adjusted model, there were 2.04 (95% CI:1.02, 4.11) and 2.17 higher odds (95% CI:1.16, 4.13) of elevated CRP when comparing quartile 4 and quartile 3, respectively, to the lowest ADI quartile. Regression models were not significant for albumin or NLR. Area deprivation is associated with CRP, a marker of stress that may lead to a higher risk of chronic diseases among cancer survivors. Future studies using a sample of cancer survivors with a wider range of ADI may help to strengthen this association.","Byrne, Cecily A; Oddo, Vanessa M; Karayeva, Evgenia; Kopetsky, Greg; Kim, Sage",Cancer medicine,2025,Humans; Male; Female; Cancer Survivors; Aged; Inflammation; C-Reactive Protein; Middle Aged; United States; Biomarkers; Neoplasms; Residence Characteristics; Neutrophils; Serum Albumin,albumin; area deprivation index; cancer survivorship; c‐reactive protein; inflammation; neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio,"Cancer Health Equity and Career Development Program, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; Kinesiology and Nutrition Department, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; School of Public Health, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; School of Public Health, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.; School of Public Health, University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.",10.1002/cam4.70784

Whether exposure to ozone concentrations consistently below current U.S. regulatory limits (70 ppb, 8-hour average) is associated with newly-diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unclear, especially among demographic subgroups. We examined associations between residential ozone and incident COPD in a large prospective cohort study in the U.S., and assessed heterogeneity by demographic subgroups. The All of Us research program followed >848,000 volunteers enrolled in 2017-2023. Among 596, 926 participants whom consented to the release of EHR data, annual average ozone concentrations from satellite measurements from 2000-2016 were linked to residential location for 376,535 participants. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate associations between ozone and incident COPD over the study period, adjusting for co-exposures and potential confounders. We assessed effect modification using cross-product terms and stratified analyses with race, sex, age, income, and smoking status. To account for non-probabilistic sampling, we applied cell weighting based on the distribution of key factors from the 2018-2022 American Community Survey. We identified 7,907 incident COPD cases over an average 4-year follow-up. Residential ozone concentrations (Median: 37.75 ppb, Min-Max: 29.79-51.39) were similar across subgroups.

The Italian Ministry of Health issued Raccomandazione 14 to provide guidelines for prevention of errors while using antineoplastic drugs. This work aimed at analyzing Raccomandazione 14 through the different viewpoints of the hospital pharmacist, the nurse, the oncologist, and the hospital director. Twenty-seven Italian healthcare organizations participated in a self-assessment survey evaluating compliance with Raccomandazione 14 within the oncology, hematology, and pharmacy departments. The self-assessment results showed a general acknowledgement of the need for centralized management of anticancer agents. The specific responsibility of the pharmacist on the centralized management of anticancer drugs from preparation to disposal emerged as a critical point. The nurse, beyond the skills in drug administration and prevention of extravasation, also plays a fundamental role in educating and supporting the patient. The physicians, who are attentive to scientific, clinical, and regulatory criteria in prescribing and monitoring the therapies, are called upon to improve awareness on the importance of sharing standardized procedures with other professionals, to minimize medication error occurrence. The implementation of a complete computerized management from prescribing to drug administration and follow-up was highlighted.

Utilizing data from the All of Us Research Program, which includes over one million Americans, we examined the documentation of genetic testing in electronic health records. Participants diagnosed with breast, ovarian, colon, endometrial, or pancreatic cancer were selected using the All of Us Workbench cohort builder tool. Descriptive and univariate analyses were conducted within the integrated Jupyter Notebook. Out of 60,135 individuals with a diagnostic code for the eligible cancers, over 73% reported a family history of cancer. However, only 281 individuals had a diagnosis or procedural code for a cancer genetic test, with 82% completing the test post-cancer diagnosis. While the All of Us data is a robust resource for large-scale research, challenges in data acquisition and interpretation arise due to the reporting structure of genetic findings in most data sources, such as electronic health records. To effectively utilize large-scale data for addressing issues in cancer genetic testing, shared data elements and standardized documentation are essential.","Underhill, Meghan L; Li, Xintong; Shah, Jaimin; Dreisbach, Caitlin",Journal of genetic counseling,2025,Humans; Electronic Health Records; Genetic Testing; Neoplasms; United States; Documentation; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Adult,cancer genetics; electronic health record; public health,"School of Nursing, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA.; Goregen Institute for Data Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA.; Goregen Institute for Data Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA.; School of Nursing, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA.; Goregen Institute for Data Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA.",10.1002/jgc4.2011
All of Us,40417568,EHR Phenotyping Methods for Measuring Treatment Adherence Among People Living With HIV in All of Us: Towards Disparities and Inequalities in HIV Care Continuum.,"HIV treatment adherence is among the most important determinants of HIV outcomes. However, only 50% of people living with HIV in the US were retained in care. Measuring HIV treatment adherence in the clinical settings is feasible but when it comes to the growing number of multi-site Electronic Health Records (EHR), there has been a dearth of research for adequate informatics methods to handle EHR. We sought to address this gap by developing a cluster of metrics for measuring HIV treatment adherence via EHR phenotyping methods. Our methods were developed and tested in the All of Us research program. We also performed preliminary analyses to explore disparities in HIV treatment adherence and demographic factors contributing to poor adherence. This study paves the way for systematic data mining and analyses for the HIV care continuum, disparities, and inequality research on All of Us and other EHR normalized with the OMOP Common Data Model.","Yue, Yuanzhen; Khanal, Ashok; Lyu, Tianchu; Weissman, Sharon; Liang, Chen",AMIA ...

All of Us,24981988,Usability testing of Avoiding Diabetes Thru Action Plan Targeting (ADAPT) decision support for integrating care-based counseling of pre-diabetes in an electronic health record.,"Usability testing can be used to evaluate human-computer interaction (HCI) and communication in shared decision making (SDM) for patient-provider behavioral change and behavioral contracting. Traditional evaluations of usability using scripted or mock patient scenarios with think-aloud protocol analysis provide a way to identify HCI issues. In this paper we describe the application of these methods in the evaluation of the Avoiding Diabetes Thru Action Plan Targeting (ADAPT) tool, and test the usability of the tool to support the ADAPT framework for integrated care counseling of pre-diabetes. The think-aloud protocol analysis typically does not provide an assessment of how patient-provider interactions are effected in ""live"" clinical workflow or whether a tool is successful. Therefore, ""Near-live"" clinical simulations involving applied simulation methods were used to compliment the think-aloud results. This complementary usability technique was used to test the end-user HCI and tool performance by more closely mimicking the clinical workflow and capturing interaction sequences along with assessing the functionality of computer module prototypes on clinician workflow. We expected this method to further complement and provide different usability findings as compared to think-aloud analysis. Together, this mixed method evaluation provided comprehensive and realistic feedback for iterative refinement of the ADAPT system prior to implementation. The study employed two phases of testing of a new interactive ADAPT tool that embedded an evidence-based shared goal setting component into primary care workflow for dealing with pre-diabetes counseling within a commercial physician office electronic health record (EHR). Phase I applied usability testing that involved ""think-aloud"" protocol analysis of eight primary care providers interacting with several scripted clinical scenarios. Phase II used ""near-live"" clinical simulations of five providers interacting with standardized trained patient actors enacting the clinical scenario of counseling for pre-diabetes, each of whom had a pedometer that recorded the number of steps taken over a week. In both phases, all sessions were audio-taped and motion screen-capture software was activated for onscreen recordings. Transcripts were coded using iterative qualitative content analysis methods. In Phase I, the impact of the components and layout of ADAPT on user's Navigation, Understandability, and Workflow were associated with the largest volume of negative comments (i.e. approximately 80% of end-user commentary), while Usability and Content of ADAPT were representative of more positive than negative user commentary. The heuristic category of Usability had a positive-to-negative comment ratio of 2.1, reflecting positive perception of the usability of the tool, its functionality, and overall co-productive utilization of ADAPT. However, there were mixed perceptions about content (i.e., how the information was displayed, organized and described in the tool). In Phase II, the duration of patient encounters was approximately 10 min with all of the Patient Instructions (prescriptions) and behavioral contracting being activated at the end of each visit. Upon activation, providers accepted the pathway prescribed by the tool 100% of the time and completed all the fields in the tool in the simulation cases. Only 14% of encounter time was spent using the functionality of the ADAPT tool in terms of keystrokes and entering relevant data. The rest of the time was spent on communication and dialog to populate the patient instructions. In all cases, the interaction sequence of reviewing and discussing exercise and diet of the patient was linked to the functionality of the ADAPT tool in terms of monitoring, response-efficacy, self-efficacy, and negotiation in the patient-provider dialog. There was a change from one-way dialog to two-way dialog and negotiation that ended in a behavioral contract. This change demonstrated the tool's sequence, which supported recording current exercise and diet followed by a diet and exercise goal setting procedure to reduce the risk of diabetes onset. This study demonstrated that ""think-aloud"" protocol analysis with ""near-live"" clinical simulations provided a successful usability evaluation of a new primary care pre-diabetes shared goal setting tool. Each phase of the study provided complementary observations on problems with the new onscreen tool and was used to show the influence of the ADAPT framework on the usability, workflow integration, and communication between the patient and provider. The think-aloud tests with the provider showed the tool can be used according to the ADAPT framework (exercise-to-diet behavior change and tool utilization), while the clinical simulations revealed the ADAPT framework to realistically support patient-provider communication to obtain behavioral change contract. SDM interactions and mechanisms affecting protocol-based care can be more completely captured by combining ""near-live"" clinical simulations with traditional ""think-aloud analysis"" which augments clinician utilization. More analysis is required to verify if the rich communication actions found in Phase II compliment clinical workflows.","Chrimes, Dillon; Kitos, Nicole R; Kushniruk, Andre; Mann, Devin M",International journal of medical informatics,2014,"Counseling; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Diabetes Mellitus; Electronic Health Records; Evidence-Based Medicine; Health Promotion; Humans; Medical Informatics; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Primary Health Care; Research Design",Behavioral change; Behavioral contracting; Clinical simulations; Electronic health records; Patient counseling; Protocol-based care; Usability,"School of Health Information Science, University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada; Sierra Systems Group Inc., Health Practice and IT Consulting, Vancouver-Calgary-Toronto, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Section of Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.; School of Health Information Science, University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Section of Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.

All of Us,40500928,Hormone Therapy Usage Is Associated With Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Prostate Cancer Patients of the All of Us Research Program Cohort.,"Hormone therapy (HT) has greatly improved overall survival for prostate cancer patients, but may also influence cardiovascular health in an already high-risk population. This retrospective cohort study examined participants in the All of Us Research Program with prostate cancer, had no prior history of adverse cardiovascular events, and were either treated or not treated with HT. HT was defined as GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists, abiraterone, androgen antagonists, or androgen receptor pathway inhibitors. We defined adverse cardiovascular event as myocardial infarctions, heart failure, or strokes. Time to adverse cardiovascular event was defined using longitudinal electronic health record data. We evaluated whether HT use affected the risk of adverse cardiovascular events using a Cox regression model adjusted for established cardiovascular risk factors. The final cohort included 5156 participants. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk covariates, HT treatment was associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular event (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.01-1.48; p = 0.03). In participants with pre-treatment dyslipidemia, HT usage was associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events (HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.19-1.95; p < 0.001). In participants without pre-treatment dyslipidemia, no association was found (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.71-1.30; p = 0.81). Our results show that HT-associated cardiovascular risk may be synergistically amplified by dyslipidemia. These results suggest that risk stratification by dyslipidemia status may improve cardiovascular outcomes for prostate cancer survivors.","Yang, Yuanchu J; Zeng, Chenjie; Schaffer, Kerry R; Tran, Tam C; Sauer, Peter J; Brown, Lincoln A; Park, Ben H; Denny, Joshua C",The Prostate,2025,,cardio‐oncology; hormone therapy; outcomes; prostate cancer,"Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Academic Internship Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.; All of Us Research Program, Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.",10.1002/pros.24913

Nevertheless, there is a constant need for real-world evidence regarding the effectiveness, adherence, and persistence of drug therapy. We investigated the use of sacubitril/valsartan for the treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction in real-world clinical practice in Italy. An observational, retrospective, non-interventional cohort study based on electronic medical records from nine specialized hospital HF centres in Italy was carried out on patients with prescription of sacubitril/valsartan. Overall, 948 patients had a prescription of sacubitril/valsartan, with 924 characterized over 6 months and followed up for 12 months. Pharmacoutilization data at 1 year of follow-up were available for 225 patients {mean age 69.7 years [standard deviation (SD) = 10.8], 81.8% male}. Of those, 398 (45.2%) reached the target dose of sacubitril/valsartan of 97/103 mg in a mean time of 6.9 (SD = 6.2) weeks. Blood pressure and hypotension in 61 patients (65%) and worsening of chronic kidney disease in 10 patients (10.6%) were the main reasons for not reaching the target dose. Approximatively 50% of patients had a change in sacubitril/valsartan dose during follow-up, and 158 (70.2%) were persistent with the treatment during the last 3 months of follow-up. A sensitivity analysis (persistence during the last 4 months of follow-up) showed persistence for 162 patients (72.0%). Adherence data, available for 387 patients, showed full adherence for 205 (53%). Discontinuation (102/717 patients, 14.2%) was mainly due to hypotension and occurred after a mean time of 34.3 (SD = 28.7) weeks. During follow-up, out of 606 patients with available data, 434 patients (71.6%) had an HF add-on drug or drugs concomitant with sacubitril/valsartan. HF-related hospitalization during follow-up was numerically higher in non-persistent (16/67 patients, 23.9%) vs. patients persistent to sacubitril/valsartan (30/158, 19%) (P = 0.405). Real-world data on the use of sacubitril/valsartan in clinical practice in Italy show a rapid titration to the target dose, high therapeutic adherence enabling a good level of therapeutic management in line with ESC guidelines for patients with reduced ejection fraction.","Iacoviello, Massimo; Di Gesaro, Gabriele; Sarullo, Filippo Maria; Miani, Daniela; Driussi, Mauro; Correale, Michele; Bilato, Claudio; Passantino, Andrea; Carluccio, Erberto; Villani, Alessandra; Degli Esposti, Luca; d'Agostino, Chiara; Peruzzi, Elena; Poli, Simone; di Lenarda, Andrea",ESC heart failure,2024,"Humans; Male; Aged; Female; Heart Failure; Stroke Volume; Retrospective Studies; Cohort Studies; Tetrazoles; Treatment Outcome; Valsartan; Hypotension; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Aminobutyrates; Biphenyl Compounds",Adherence; Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; Persistence; Pharmacoutilization; Real-world practice; Sacubitril/valsartan,"Surgical and Medical Sciences Department, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy.; U.O.

Cardiac surgery has higher perioperative risk, and longer fasting periods may be not well-tolerated. We analysed the postoperative metabolic and hemodynamic variables in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) according to their morning or afternoon schedule. Single-centre retrospective study at University teaching hospital (1-year data collection from electronic medical records). Using a mixed-effects linear regression model adjusted for several covariates, we compared metabolic (lactatemia, pH, and base deficit [BD]) and haemodynamic values (patients on vasoactive support, and vasoactive inotropic score [VIS]) at 7 prespecified time-points (admission to intensive care, and 1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th, 18th, and 24th postoperative hours). 339 patients (n = 176 morning, n = 163 afternoon) were included. Arterial lactatemia and BD were similar (overall P = 0.11 and P = 0.84, respectively), while pH was significantly lower in the morning group (overall P < 0.05; mean difference -0.01). Postoperative urine output, fluid balance, mean arterial pressure, and central venous pressure were similar (P = 0.59, P = 0.96, P = 0.58 and P = 0.53, respectively).

All of Us,40340717,Reproducibility of genetic risk factors identified for long COVID using combinatorial analysis across US and UK patient cohorts with diverse ancestries.,"Long COVID is a major public health burden causing a diverse array of debilitating symptoms in tens of millions of patients globally. In spite of this overwhelming disease prevalence, staggering cost, severe impact on patients' lives and intense global research efforts, study of the disease has proved challenging due to its complexity. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified only four loci potentially associated with the disease, although these results did not statistically replicate between studies. A previous combinatorial analysis study identified a total of 73 genes that were highly associated with two long COVID cohorts in the predominantly (> 91%) white European ancestry Sano GOLD population, and we sought to reproduce these findings in the independent and ancestrally more diverse All of Us (AoU) population. We assessed the reproducibility of the 5343 long COVID disease signatures from the original study in the AoU population. Because the very small population sizes provide very limited power to replicate findings, we initially tested whether we observed a statistically significant enrichment of the Sano GOLD disease signatures that are also positively correlated with long COVID in the AoU cohort after controlling for population substructure. For the Sano GOLD disease signatures that have a case frequency greater than 5% in AoU, we consistently observed a significant enrichment (77-83%, p < 0.01) of signatures that are also positively associated with long COVID in the AoU cohort. These encompassed 92% of the genes identified in the original study. At least five of the disease signatures found in Sano GOLD were also shown to be individually significantly associated with increased long COVID prevalence in the AoU population. Rates of signature reproducibility are strongest among self-identified white patients, but we also observe significant enrichment of reproducing disease associations in self-identified black/African-American and Hispanic/Latino cohorts. Signatures associated with 11 out of the 13 drug repurposing candidates identified in the original Sano GOLD study were reproduced in this study. These results demonstrate the reproducibility of long COVID disease signal found by combinatorial analysis, broadly validating the results of the original analysis. They provide compelling evidence for a much broader array of genetic associations with long COVID than previously identified through traditional GWAS studies. This strongly supports the hypothesis that genetic factors play a critical role in determining an individual's susceptibility to long COVID following recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. It also lends weight to the drug repurposing candidates identified in the original analysis. Together these results may help to stimulate much needed new precision medicine approaches to more effectively diagnose and treat the disease. This is also the first reproduction of long COVID genetic associations across multiple populations with substantially different ancestry distributions. Given the high reproducibility rate across diverse populations, these findings may have broader clinical application and promote better health equity. We hope that this will provide confidence to explore some of these mechanisms and drug targets and help advance research into novel ways to diagnose the disease and accelerate the discovery and selection of better therapeutic options, both in the form of newly discovered drugs and/or the immediate prioritization of coordinated investigations into the efficacy of repurposed drug candidates.","Sardell, J; Pearson, M; Chocian, K; Das, S; Taylor, K; Strivens, M; Gupta, R; Rochlin, A; Gardner, S",Journal of translational medicine,2025,"Humans; COVID-19; Reproducibility of Results; United States; Genome-Wide Association Study; Risk Factors; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; United Kingdom; Cohort Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Male; Female; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; White People; Middle Aged; White",Combinatorial analytics; Genetics; Long COVID; PASC; Post COVID-19 condition; Post-acute COVID-19; Reproducibility; SARS-CoV-2,"PrecisionLife Ltd., Unit 8b Bankside, Hanborough Business Park, Long Hanborough, OX29 8LJ, UK.; PrecisionLife Ltd., Unit 8b Bankside, Hanborough Business Park, Long Hanborough, OX29 8LJ, UK.; PrecisionLife Ltd., Unit 8b Bankside, Hanborough Business Park, Long Hanborough, OX29 8LJ, UK.; PrecisionLife Ltd., Unit 8b Bankside, Hanborough Business Park, Long Hanborough, OX29 8LJ, UK.; PrecisionLife Ltd., Unit 8b Bankside, Hanborough Business Park, Long Hanborough, OX29 8LJ, UK.; PrecisionLife Ltd., Unit 8b Bankside, Hanborough Business Park, Long Hanborough, OX29 8LJ, UK.; Metrodora Institute, 3535 South Market Street, West Valley City, UT, 84119, USA.; Complex Disorders Alliance, 2299 Summer St. #1140, Stamford, CT, 06905, USA.; PrecisionLife Ltd., Unit 8b Bankside, Hanborough Business Park, Long Hanborough, OX29 8LJ, UK. steve@precisionlife.com.; Complex Disorders Alliance, 2299 Summer St. #1140, Stamford, CT, 06905, USA. steve@precisionlife.com.",10.1186/s12967-025-06535-x
All of Us,39586798,Identifying diagnosed major chronic diseases associated with recent housing instability among aging adults: data from the 'All of Us' research program.,"Housing instability is a known barrier to healthcare utilization potentially affecting the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases among diverse groups of adults. We examined the intersection of recent housing instability with prevalent cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and psychiatric diagnoses among aging adults. Cross-sectional data on 147 465 participants of the 'All of Us' Research Program (6 May 2018-1 July 2022), ≥50 years of age at enrollment, were analyzed. Self-reported housing instability over the past 6 months was examined in relation to diagnosed conditions at age ≥50 years based on electronic health records. Multivariable logistic regression models sequentially adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were constructed to estimate odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). After adjusting for confounders, past 6 months housing instability was associated with lower odds of diagnosed cardiovascular disease (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.87, 0.93) and cancer (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.86), higher odds of diagnosed psychiatric (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.40) conditions, but was unrelated to diagnosed diabetes (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.01). Recent housing instability among aging adults is positively associated with psychiatric diagnoses, but negatively associated with cardiovascular and cancer diagnoses, with implications for chronic disease prevention.","Beydoun, Hind A; Mayno Vieytes, Christian A; Beydoun, May A; Lampros, Austin; Tsai, Jack","Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",2025,Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Chronic Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Aged; United States; Housing; Mental Disorders; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus; Neoplasms,aging; cancer; cardiovascular disease; diabetes; housing; psychiatric,"National Center on Homelessness among Veterans (NCHAV), Veterans Health Administration, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Ave NW, Washington, DC 20420, USA.; Department of Management, Policy, and Community Health, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, 1200 Pressler St., Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, National Institute on Aging, 251 Bayview Boulevard, NIA/NIH/IRP, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.; Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, National Institute on Aging, 251 Bayview Boulevard, NIA/NIH/IRP, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.; National Center on Homelessness among Veterans (NCHAV), Veterans Health Administration, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Ave NW, Washington, DC 20420, USA.; National Center on Homelessness among Veterans (NCHAV), Veterans Health Administration, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Ave NW, Washington, DC 20420, USA.; Department of Management, Policy, and Community Health, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, 1200 Pressler St., Houston, TX 77030, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, 300 George Street, New Haven, CT 06511, USA.",10.1093/pubmed/fdae300
All of Us,40409746,Unlocking the Potential of Wear Time of a Wearable Device to Enhance Postpartum Depression Screening and Detection: Cross-Sectional Study.,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a mood disorder affecting 1 in 7 women after childbirth that is often underscreened and underdetected. If not diagnosed and treated, PPD is associated with long-term developmental challenges in the child and maternal morbidity. Wearable technologies, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers (eg, Fitbit), offer continuous and longitudinal digital phenotyping for mood disorder diagnosis and monitoring, with device wear time being an important yet understudied aspect. We aimed to suggest that wear time of a wearable device may provide additional information about perinatal mental health to facilitate screening and early detection of PPD. We proposed that wear time of a wearable device may also be valuable for managing other mental health disorders. Using the All of Us Research Program dataset, we identified females who experienced childbirth with and without PPD using computational phenotyping. We compared the percentage of days and number of hours per day females with and without PPD wore Fitbit devices during prepregnancy, pregnancy, postpartum, and PPD periods, determined by electronic health records. Comparisons between females with and without PPD were conducted using linear regression models. We also assessed the correlation between Fitbit wear time consistency (measured as the maximum number of consecutive days the Fitbit was worn) during prepregnancy and PPD periods in females with and without PPD using the Pearson correlation. All analyses were run with Bonferroni correction. Our findings showed a strong trend, although nonsignificant after multiple testing correction, that females in the PPD cohort wore their Fitbits more than those in non-PPD cohort during the postpartum (PPD cohort: mean 69.9%, 95% CI 42.7%-97%; non-PPD cohort: mean 50%, 95% CI 25.5%-74.4%; P=.02) and PPD periods (PPD cohort: mean 66.6%, 95% CI 37.9%-95.3%; non-PPD cohort: mean 46.4%, 95% CI 20.5%-72.2%; P=.02). We found no difference in the number of hours per day females in the PPD and non-PPD cohorts wore their Fitbit during any period of pregnancy. Finally, there was no relationship between the consistency of Fitbit wear time during prepregnancy and PPD periods (r=-0.05, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.38; P=.84); however, there was a trend, though nonsignificant, in Fitbit wear time consistency among females without PPD (r=0.25, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.49; P=.07). We hypothesize that increased Fitbit wear time among females with PPD may be attributed to hypervigilance, given the common co-occurrence of anxiety symptoms. Future studies should assess the link between PPD, hypervigilance, and wear time patterns. We envision that wear time patterns of a wearable device combined with digital biomarkers such as sleep and physical activity could enhance early PPD detection using machine learning by alerting clinicians to potential concerns and facilitating timely screenings, which may have implications for other mental health disorders.","Hurwitz, Eric; Meltzer-Brody, Samantha; Butzin-Dozier, Zachary; Patel, Rena C; Elhadad, Noémie; Haendel, Melissa A",JMIR formative research,2025,"Humans; Female; Depression, Postpartum; Wearable Electronic Devices; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Pregnancy; Mass Screening; Time Factors; Young Adult; Postpartum Period",All of Us; Fitbit; postpartum depression; screening; wear time; wearable device,"Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.; Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.; Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States.; Department of Infectious Disease, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States.",10.2196/67585

Electronic data capture tools simplify data collection from different centers and supports the management of multicenter clinical trials. The Ligurian HIV Network (LHN) is one such tool, originating from a regional effort to integrate clinical trial capabilities for HIV and other chronic infectious diseases. In order to manually collect a complete report of all clinical tests on patients enrolled in a trial, a strenuous human effort and the allocation of great resources would be necessary. Moreover, the risk of error in a manual system is very high. The proposed system automatically extracts clinical data from the EHR of three hospitals of the LHN in a standardized way, and enhance their re-use in clinical trials. Through dedicated questionnaires, physicians reported a strongly positive feedback about the efficacy of the platform in supporting clinical research.","Giannini, Barbara; Mora, Sara; Gazzarata, Roberta; Di Biagio, Antonio; Cenderello, Giovanni; Dentone, Chiara; Setti, Maurizio; Fenoglio, Daniela; Cassola, Giovanni; Viscoli, Claudio; Giacomini, Mauro",Studies in health technology and informatics,2019,Electronic Health Records; Evidence-Based Medicine; HIV; Humans; Medical Informatics; Research,Clinical Trial; Electronic Health Records; Health Level Seven,"Department of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics and System Engineering, (DIBRIS), University of Genoa, Italy.; Department of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics and System Engineering, (DIBRIS), University of Genoa, Italy.; Healthropy, Savona, Italy.; Infectious Diseases Unit, IRCCS AOU S.

All of Us,37188476,Protocol for developing a personalised prediction model for viral suppression among under-represented populations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Sustained viral suppression, an indicator of long-term treatment success and mortality reduction, is one of four strategic areas of the 'Ending the HIV Epidemic' federal campaign launched in 2019. Under-represented populations, like racial or ethnic minority populations, sexual and gender minority groups, and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, are disproportionately affected by HIV and experience a more striking virological failure. The COVID-19 pandemic might magnify the risk of incomplete viral suppression among under-represented people living with HIV (PLWH) due to interruptions in healthcare access and other worsened socioeconomic and environmental conditions. However, biomedical research rarely includes under-represented populations, resulting in biased algorithms. This proposal targets a broadly defined under-represented HIV population. It aims to develop a personalised viral suppression prediction model using machine learning (ML) techniques by incorporating multilevel factors using All of Us (AoU) data. This cohort study will use data from the AoU research programme, which aims to recruit a broad, diverse group of US populations historically under-represented in biomedical research. The programme harmonises data from multiple sources on an ongoing basis. It has recruited ~4800 PLWH with a series of self-reported survey data (eg, Lifestyle, Healthcare Access, COVID-19 Participant Experience) and relevant longitudinal electronic health records data. We will examine the change in viral suppression and develop personalised viral suppression prediction due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using ML techniques, such as tree-based classifiers (classification and regression trees, random forest, decision tree and eXtreme Gradient Boosting), support vector machine, naïve Bayes and long short-term memory. The institutional review board approved the study at the University of South Carolina (Pro00124806) as a Non-Human Subject study. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated at national and international conferences and through social media.","Zhang, Jiajia; Yang, Xueying; Weissman, Sharon; Li, Xiaoming; Olatosi, Bankole",BMJ open,2023,Humans; COVID-19; Ethnicity; Cohort Studies; Pandemics; Bayes Theorem; Minority Groups; Population Health; HIV Infections,COVID-19; HIV & AIDS; PUBLIC HEALTH; STATISTICS & RESEARCH METHODS,"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of South Carolina Arnold School of Public Health, Columbia, South Carolina, USA.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, University of South Carolina Arnold School of Public Health, Columbia, South Carolina, USA.; Health Promotion Education and Behavior, University of South Carolina Arnold School of Public Health, Columbia, South Carolina, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, USA.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, University of South Carolina Arnold School of Public Health, Columbia, South Carolina, USA.; Health Promotion Education and Behavior, University of South Carolina Arnold School of Public Health, Columbia, South Carolina, USA.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, University of South Carolina Arnold School of Public Health, Columbia, South Carolina, USA olatosi@mailbox.sc.edu.; Health Services Policy and Management, University of South Carolina Arnold School of Public Health, Columbia, South Carolina, USA.",10.1136/bmjopen-2022-070869

Using data from the  Among 245,388 participants (mean age 51.8 years, 59.3 % women, 51.3 % non-Hispanic White, 20.4 % non-Hispanic Black, 3 % non-Hispanic Asian, 19.3 % Hispanic), 448 were identified as FH genetic variant carriers, yielding a prevalence of 1 in 546 (95 % CI: 1/602- 1/500). Prevalence was highest among Asian non-Hispanics (1 in 286) and lowest in Hispanics (1 in 694); p-value = 0.003. Males had a higher prevalence of FH variants than females (1 in 485 vs. 1 in 602, p-value = 0.03). Regardless of LDL-C levels, FH variant carriers had a higher prevalence of ASCVD history than those without FH variants (p-value = 0.04).

ASCVD prevalence was higher in males with FH variants than females (25 % vs. 18 %, p-value = 0.04). Significant racial, ethnic, and sex disparities exist in the prevalence, ASCVD burden, and LLT use among FH variant carriers.

These associations are population-specific and many have not yet been tested for association with the clinical outcome of interest. To fill this gap in knowledge, we accessed the epidemiologic Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES III) and BioVU, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center biorepository linked to de-identified electronic health records (EHRs), including billing codes (ICD-9-CM) and clinical notes, to test population-specific Lp(a)-associated variants for an association with myocardial infarction (MI) among African Americans. We performed electronic phenotyping among African Americans in BioVU≥40 years of age using billing codes. At total of 93 cases and 522 controls were identified in NHANES III and 265 cases and 363 controls were identified in BioVU. We tested five known Lp(a)-associated genetic variants (rs1367211, rs41271028, rs6907156, rs10945682, and rs1652507) in both NHANES III and BioVU for association with myocardial infarction. We also tested LPA rs3798220 (I4399M), previously associated with increased levels of Lp(a), MI, and coronary artery disease in European Americans, in BioVU. After meta-analysis, tests of association using logistic regression assuming an additive genetic model revealed no significant associations (p<0.05) for any of the five LPA variants previously associated with Lp(a) levels in African Americans. Also, I4399M rs3798220 was not associated with MI in African Americans (odds ratio = 0.51; 95% confidence interval: 0.16 - 1.65; p=0.26) despite strong, replicated associations with MI and coronary artery disease in European American genome-wide association studies.

Researchers have assessed the genetic factors that influence HTG in studies focused predominantly on individuals of European ancestry (EA). However, relatively little is known about the contribution of genetic variation to HTG in people of AA, potentially constraining research and treatment opportunities; the lipid profile for African ancestry (AA) populations differs from that of EA populations-which may be partially attributable to genetics.

Using data from the All of Us Research Program (n=18,746), we conducted both intention-to-treat and per-protocol phenome-wide association studies comparing diagnoses following GLP-1 RA prescription, including semaglutide-specific analyses, to those following sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) prescriptions in individuals with T2D. GLP-1 RAs were associated with reduced risks of genitourinary and dental conditions relative to comparators, while semaglutide was linked to lower risks of cardiac arrhythmia, hyperglycemia, and chronic kidney disease. However, GLP-1 RAs were also associated with increased risks of dysthymic disorder and vitamin D deficiency. Time-to-event analyses revealed modest delays in diagnosis for key outcomes. These findings underscore differences in downstream associations across second-line T2D therapies and highlight semaglutide's distinct profile. Results may inform clinical decision-making and motivate further research on effectiveness, safety, and personalized prescribing.","Salvatore, Maxwell; Zhang, Bingyu; Tang, Huilin; Lu, Yiwen; Zhang, Dazheng; Zhou, Ting; Lu, Yuan; Amaro, Anastassia; Ritchie, Marylyn; Chen, Yong",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025,,diabetes; electronic health record; glp-1 ra; semaglutide; survival analysis,"Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.; Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.; The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence (CHASE), University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence (CHASE), University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; The Graduate Group in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science, School of Arts and Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.; The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence (CHASE), University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence (CHASE), University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; The Graduate Group in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science, School of Arts and Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.; The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence (CHASE), University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.; The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence (CHASE), University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.; Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.; The Center for Health AI and Synthesis of Evidence (CHASE), University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; The Graduate Group in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science, School of Arts and Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.",10.1101/2025.06.03.25328908

It is estimated that more than 10 million individuals are heterozygous for a pathogenic CFTR gene variant in the US (heterozygotes). The phenotypic risk of these heterozygotes is not well defined, particularly among populations of predominantly non-European genetic ancestry. Understanding disease risk across each population can improve management strategies for all. To examine associations of diseases across the phenome with CFTR heterozygotes. The All of Us Research Program is a US-based ongoing longitudinal cohort study whose enrollment started nationally in 2018. In this genetic association study, whole-genome sequencing data were linked to electronic health records (EHRs) and surveys. Participants were 18 years and older. Similarity to genetic ancestral groups was genetically inferred using All of Us data and 2 large reference datasets, the 1000 Genomes Project and Human Genome Diversity Project. This analysis was conducted between February and April 2025. A single pathogenic CFTR variant. The main variables included clinical diagnoses documented in EHRs. Multivariable-adjusted phenome-wide association studies were performed. The main measures were odds ratios (ORs), indicating risk for a particular disease or condition. Overall, 363 pathogenic variants were identified in the cohort. Among 317 964 adult participants (55.7% female; mean [SD] last age in EHR, 56.1 [16.9] years), 7957 heterozygotes and 280 995 noncarriers were identified. Participants were followed up through EHRs with a mean (SD) follow-up of 12.4 (9.0) years. The genetically inferred ancestral distribution of the cohort was 18.0% African, 16.2% American or Admixed American, 2.1% East Asian, 53.4% European, 0.3% South Asian, and 0.4% West Asian. Frequencies of heterozygotes varied by groups of genetic similarity to reference populations: 3.62% in participants most genetically similar to a European reference population (n = 169 812), 1.35% in participants most genetically similar to an African reference population (n = 57 297), and 1.86% in participants most genetically similar to an Admixed American reference population (n = 51 483).

Among 52 cystic fibrosis-associated diseases, although an elevated risk of respiratory diseases and infections was observed in some heterozygotes (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.27-4.95]; bronchiectasis [OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.00-1.47]; pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae [OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.05-2.26]; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05-1.24]; asthma [OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.15]; and Pseudomonas infection [OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03-1.74]), effect sizes of these associations were several orders of magnitude lower than those found in homozygotes or predicted compound heterozygotes. In this genetic association study, most heterozygotes did not appear to have a substantially higher risk of cystic fibrosis-associated diseases during their adulthood compared to noncarriers. Additional studies are needed to investigate the underlying factors for the elevated risk of respiratory and infectious diseases in some heterozygotes.","Zeng, Chenjie; Han, Sangwoo T; Cassini, Thomas A; Raraigh, Karen S; Tran, Tam C; Yang, James; Cutting, Garry R; Denny, Joshua C",JAMA internal medicine,2025,,,"Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, New York Genome Center, New York, New York.; Division of Medical Genetics and Genomic Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Department of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.; Precision Health Informatics Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; All of Us Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.",10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.1853
All of Us,33707570,Four-decade trends in lymph node status of patients with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma in northern Italy.,"The 4-decade (1980-2017) trends in lymph node status of patients with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) in a province of northern Italy were investigated. Information was collected on lymph node dissection, number of lymph nodes dissected, lymph node involvement, and number of positive lymph nodes from a series of 760 patients admitted to a tertiary referral centre for vulvar disease. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for lymph node involvement, for ≥ 2 positive nodes, and for a lymph node ratio ≥ 20% were estimated from multiple logistic regression models. The adjusted OR for lymph node dissection was greater in the 2000s and 2010s versus the 1980s. The adjusted OR for lymph node involvement was 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72-2.60) in the 1990s, 1.31 (95% CI, 0.72-2.38) in the 2000s and 1.32 (95% CI, 0.73-2.41) in the 2010s versus the 1980s. The adjusted OR for ≥ 2 positive nodes was 1.36 (95% CI, 0.68-2.72), 0.86 (95% CI, 0.44-1.65) and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.34-1.31), respectively. The adjusted OR for lymph node ratio ≥ 20% was 1.45 (95% CI, 0.62-3.43), 1.21 (95% CI, 0.54-2.72) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.35-1.89), respectively.

All of Us,35641985,Integrating mammography screening programmes into specialist breast centres in Italy: insights from a national survey of Senonetwork breast centres.,"Despite recommendations, mammography screening is often insufficiently integrated into specialist breast centres. A national, cross-sectional, voluntary, online survey on this issue was carried out among the Italian breast centres associated with Senonetwork, the Italian network of breast cancer services. A 73-item questionnaire was created, pre-tested and piloted. Centres integrating and not integrating a screening programme were compared using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model. Centres' clustering was performed using the Gower's distance metric. Groups and clusters were compared with the equality-of-means test. The response rate was 82/128 (65%). Overall, 84% (69/82) breast centres reported a collaboration with a screening programme in performing and/or reading mammograms and in the diagnostic work-up of women with abnormal screening results. The same proportion was observed among those centres responding to all questions (62/74). Performance expectancies (or the perceived usefulness of integration in terms of clinical quality, patient convenience, ease of job, and professional growth), satisfaction and motivation were higher in those centres collaborating with the screening programme. Effort expectancy indicators (or the degree to which the respondents believe that the integration is easy to implement) and those concerning the existence of facilitating conditions were lower both in centres collaborating and not collaborating with the screening programme. Among the former, six clusters of centres, distributed from 'no integration' to 'high', were identified. In cluster analysis, the highest level of integration was associated with higher agreement that integration eases the job, offers better opportunities for professional growth, and makes the working environment more satisfactory. The least integrated cluster assigned the lowest score to the statement that local health authority made available the resources needed. While confirming the positive effects of integrating screening programmes into breast centres, this survey has brought to light specific difficulties that must be faced. The results provide insights into the importance of integration focusing on the perspectives of professional career and motivation. The deficiency of facilitating conditions to integration is modifiable. Screening professionals' societies may have a role as initiators of the integration. Other supporting actions may be included in health laws at the national and regional level.","Deandrea, Silvia; Ferrè, Francesca; D'Antona, Rosanna; Angiolini, Catia; Bortul, Marina; Bucchi, Lauro; Caumo, Francesca; Fortunato, Lucio; Giordano, Livia; Giordano, Monica; Mantellini, Paola; Martelli, Irene; Melucci, Giuseppe; Naldoni, Carlo; Paci, Eugenio; Pau, Loredana; Saguatti, Gianni; Sestini, Elisabetta; Tinterri, Corrado; Vainieri, Milena; Cataliotti, Luigi",BMC health services research,2022,Breast Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Italy; Mammography,Breast centre; Health services integration; Mammography screening; Survey; UTAUT,"Environmental Health Unit, Agency for Health Protection, Pavia, Italy.; Department EMbeDS, Management and Health Laboratory, Institute of Management, Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa, Italy.; Europa Donna Italia, Milan, Italy.; SOD Oncologia Della Mammella, Breast Unit, DAI Oncologico, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.; Breast Unit, Division of General Surgery, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Giuliano Isontina, Hospital of Cattinara, Trieste, Italy.; Romagna Cancer Registry, Romagna Cancer Institute, IRCCS Istituto Romagnolo Per Lo Studio Dei Tumori (IRST) Dino Amadori, Meldola, Italy. lauro.bucchi@irst.emr.it.; Department of Breast Radiology, Veneto Institute of Oncology, IRCCS, Padua, Italy.; Breast Centre, San Giovanni-Addolorata Hospital, Rome, Italy.; CPO Piedmont, AOU Cittá Della Salute E Della Scienza, Turin, Italy.; Medical Oncology Department, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale Lariana, Como, Italy.; Screening Unit, ISPRO - Oncological Network, Prevention and Research Institute, Florence, Italy.; Department EMbeDS, Management and Health Laboratory, Institute of Management, Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa, Italy.; SS Radiologia Senologica, ASL 'SS.

Consequently, such patients are often excluded from clinical trials. In Italy an expanded access program (EAP) was used to evaluate nivolumab efficacy and safety in this subpopulation outside a clinical trial. In this EAP, nivolumab was available for patients with non-squamous NSCLC in progression after at least one systemic treatment for stage IIIB/IV disease. Nivolumab 3 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 2 weeks. Patients with brain metastases could be included if they were asymptomatic, neurologically stable and either off corticosteroids or on a stable or decreasing dose of ≤10 mg/day prednisone. 409 out of 1588 patients included had asymptomatic or controlled brain metastases. A median of 7 doses (range 1-45) were delivered. Median follow-up was 6.1 months (range 0.1-21.9). The disease control rate was 39%: 4 patients had a complete response, 64 a partial response and 96 showed stable disease. At baseline, 118 patients were on corticosteroids and 74 were undergoing concomitant radiotherapy. The median overall survival in this subpopulation was 8.6 months (95% CI: 6.4-10.8). 337 discontinued treatment for various reasons, 23 (7%) of whom due to adverse events, in line with that observed in the overall population and in previous studies. Our results confirm that nivolumab is active in non-squamous NSCLC patients with brain metastases, despite their poor prognosis. Its safety profile is also concordant with results in the EAP overall population and in patients with other malignancies.","Crinò, Lucio; Bronte, Giuseppe; Bidoli, Paolo; Cravero, Paola; Minenza, Elisa; Cortesi, Enrico; Garassino, Marina C; Proto, Claudia; Cappuzzo, Federico; Grossi, Francesco; Tonini, Giuseppe; Sarobba, Maria Giuseppina; Pinotti, Graziella; Numico, Gianmauro; Samaritani, Riccardo; Ciuffreda, Libero; Frassoldati, Antonio; Bregni, Marco; Santo, Antonio; Piantedosi, Francovito; Illiano, Alfonso; De Marinis, Filippo; Tamberi, Stefano; Giannarelli, Diana; Delmonte, Angelo","Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; Brain Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Immunotherapy; Italy; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Nivolumab; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome",Brain metastasis; Immune checkpoint inhibitors; Nivolumab; Non-small cell lung cancer; Non-squamous,"Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.; Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.

We assessed the association between pre-treatment lymphopenia, toxicity, and clinical outcomes in elderly patients with metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) treated with first-line sunitinib. Prognostic factors in these patients were also evaluated. We reviewed the clinical records of 181 patients with mRCC aged ≥70 years treated with first-line sunitinib in 17 Italian Oncology Units from February 2006 to September 2011. Baseline lymphopenia was defined as lymphocyte counts <1000/μL. Twenty-nine (16%) patients had a baseline lymphocyte count <1000/μL (group A) and 152 (84%) patients had a lymphocyte count ≥1000/μL (group B). Although no differences between the two groups were reported in terms of overall response rate (P = 0.207), dose reductions (P = 0.740), discontinuation due to adverse events (P = 0.175) or overall incidence of grade 3-4 toxicities (P = 0.112), more patients in the lymphopenia group had grade 3-4 neutropenia (P = 0.017), grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia (P = 0.017) and grade 3-4 diarrhea (P = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, performance status and Heng score were predictors of progression-free survival (P = 0.015 and P = 0.0006, respectively), while performance status, Heng score, and lymphopenia were found to be significantly associated with overall survival (P = 0.007, P < 0.0001 and P = 0.023, respectively).

All of Us,39398989,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health care utilization among people living with HIV: A real-world data study.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted mental health worldwide, particularly among vulnerable populations such as people living with HIV (PLWH). However, large-scale, real-world data on mental health care utilization and associated factors among PLWH remain limited. This study leveraged electronic health records (EHR) and Basics survey data from the All of Us program to explore mental health care utilization and associated factors among PLWH during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a retrospective cohort design, we identified and included 4,575 PLWH through computational phenotyping based on relevant Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) concept sets from the All of Us program between March 2018 and March 2022. Mental health care utilization was measured using the yearly count of mental health care visits over this period. The pattern of mental health care utilization was compared between pre-pandemic (2018-2020) and during the pandemic (2020-2022). Incidence rate ratios (IRR) from the Poisson generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to examine associations between mental health care utilization, history of COVID-19 infection, demographic factors, pre-existing chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), and socioeconomic status. Among 4,575 PLWH, the annual number of mental health care visits decreased significantly during the pandemic period (March 2020 - March 2022) compared to the pre-pandemic period (March 2018 - February 2020) (IRR = 0.89, p < 0.001). The Poisson regression analysis found that a history of COVID-19 infection was associated with a higher number of mental health care visits (IRR = 1.35, p < 0.001). Middle-aged groups with participants aged 30-39 (IRR= 2.35, p = 0.002), 40-49 (IRR= 3.49, p < 0.001), and 50-64 (IRR= 2.07, p = 0.004) had significantly higher visit numbers compared to the youngest group (18-29 years). Black or African American participants were less likely to have visits compared to White participants (IRR = 0.71, p = 0.002). Medicaid health insurance was associated with an increase (IRR = 1.29, p = 0.007), while employer- or union-sponsored insurance was associated with a decrease in mental health care utilization (IRR = 0.54, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). Pre-existing comorbidities greatly increased the number of mental health care visits (one comorbidity: IRR = 5.49, two or more: IRR = 10.4, p < 0.001). Our study reveals a significant decrease in mental health care utilization and the diverse experiences of mental healthcare among PLWH during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings underscore the importance of addressing disparities in mental health care access, particularly during public health emergencies, and suggest the need for tailored interventions to meet the mental health care needs of PLWH.","Pasha, Atana; Qiao, Shan; Zhang, Jiajia; Cai, Ruilie; He, Buwei; Yang, Xueying; Liang, Chen; Weissman, Sharon; Li, Xiaoming",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024,,All of Us; COVID-19; HIV; Health disparities; Mental health care utilization,"Department of Health Promotion, Education and Behavior, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; Department of Health Promotion, Education and Behavior, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; Department of Health Promotion, Education and Behavior, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; Department of Health Services Policy and Management, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; Department of Health Promotion, Education and Behavior, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.; South Carolina SmartState Center for Healthcare Quality, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.",10.1101/2024.09.26.24314443
All of Us,38840095,Increased risk of hearing loss associated with MT-RNR1 gene mutations: a real-world investigation among Han Taiwanese Population.,"Previous studies have implicated inherited mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). However, the definitive association between mitochondrial 12S rRNA (MT-RNR1) variants and hearing loss in the population has not been well established, particularly in Asia. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to assess the association between MT-RNR1 variants and the risk of SNHL in patients in Taiwan. The cohort included 306,068 participants from Taiwan between January 2003 and December 2020. Participants were classified based on genetic variants, particularly mitochondrial mutations (rs267606618, rs267606619, rs267606617). MT-RNR1 variant cases were matched 1:10 with non-mutant patients by age, gender, and visit year, excluding those with pre-existing hearing loss. The primary endpoint was SNHL, identified using specific ICD-TM codes with a 90% positive predictive value. Medication exposure history was determined via self-report or electronic medical records in the hospital. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess the association between MT-RNR1 variants and hearing loss, adjusting for various covariates. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests compared hearing loss incidence between groups. The mean age of the mtDNA variants group is 32.4 years, with a standard deviation of 19.2 years. The incidence density of hearing loss for the mutation group was 36.42 per 10,000 person-years (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 27.21-47.73), which was higher than the 23.77per 10,000 person-years (95% CI, 21.32-26.42) in the wild-type group (p = 0.0036). Additionally, diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased risk of developing SNHL in individuals with MT-RNR1 variants (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.76 [95% CI, 1.00-3.09], p < 0.05). This study highlights the increased risk of hearing loss in patients carrying MT-RNR1 variants, particularly those with diabetes mellitus. Future research that integrates genetic and clinical data is crucial for developing more precise interventions to monitor and treat hearing loss in this vulnerable population.","Chen, Hou-Kuang; Hsieh, Yow-Wen; Hsu, Hsing-Yu; Liu, Ting-Yuan; Zhang, Yu-Ting; Lin, Chia-Der; Tsai, Fuu-Jen",BMC medical genomics,2024,"Adolescent; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult; DNA, Mitochondrial; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Hearing Loss; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Mutation; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; RNA, Ribosomal; Taiwan; Mitochondrial Proteins; Peptides",Mitochondrial 12S rRNA (MT-RNR1); Mitochondrial DNA; Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL),"Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.; School of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.; Graduate Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.; Million-person precision medicine initiative, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Pharmacy, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.; Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. 006355@tool.caaumed.org.tw.; Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. 000704@tool.caaumed.org.tw.; School of Chinese Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. 000704@tool.caaumed.org.tw.; Division of Pediatric Genetics, Children's Hospital of China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. 000704@tool.caaumed.org.tw.; Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan. 000704@tool.caaumed.org.tw.",10.1186/s12920-024-01921-8

The relationship between time to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy (TTC), calculated in weeks, and disease-free (DFS) or overall survival (OS), was assessed in 921 EBC patients with rapidly proliferating tumours (thymidine labelling index >3% or G3 or Ki67 >20%), randomised in a phase III clinical trial (NCT01031030) to receive chemotherapy with or without anthracyclines (epirubicin→cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF) versus CMF→epirubicin versus CMF). DFS, OS and 95% confidence intervals (95% confidence interval (CI)) were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate Cox analysis was performed in relation with nodal involvement, oestrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, Ki67 value, type of adjuvant chemotherapy, menopausal status and tumour size. At a median follow-up of 105 months (range 2-188), a prolonged TTC resulted in a significant increase in the risk of relapse: hazard ratio (HR) 1.15 (95% CI 1.02-1.30, p=0.019). Using a backward elimination procedure, TTC, tumour size and nodal involvement remained significantly associated with DFS. A time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was subsequently utilised to evaluate the best cut-off for TTC, identifying 7 weeks as the best threshold for longer OS (p=0.043): 8-year OS 88% (95% CI 85-90) for patients with a TTC <7 weeks and 78% (95% CI 68-87) for the other group. Our results confirm that a shorter TTC may reduce relapses and possibly also improve clinical outcome in patients with highly proliferating EBC.","Farolfi, Alberto; Scarpi, Emanuela; Rocca, Andrea; Mangia, Anita; Biglia, Nicoletta; Gianni, Lorenzo; Tienghi, Amelia; Valerio, Maria Rosaria; Gasparini, Giampietro; Amaducci, Laura; Faedi, Marina; Baldini, Editta; Rubagotti, Alessandra; Maltoni, Roberta; Paradiso, Angelo; Amadori, Dino","European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2015,"Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Proliferation; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Disease Progression; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Italy; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Mastectomy; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Time-to-Treatment; Treatment Outcome",Adjuvant chemotherapy; Early breast cancer; Rapidly proliferating tumour; Time to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy,"Department of Medical Oncology, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.

However, results may not be generalizable to the U.S. population due to the program's targeted recruitment efforts. We compared All of Us participants to those from the nationally representative continuous 1999-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with respect to: overall mortality rates; the distribution of sociodemographic, health-related, and clinical characteristics; the association of each characteristic with mortality estimated using Cox proportional-hazards models; and population attributable fractions (PAFs) for each characteristic and mortality. All of Us participants were older, less likely to be Non-Hispanic White, had more years of education, and had a higher prevalence of major chronic conditions than NHANES. Mortality rates were generally lower for All of Us participants, especially at older ages. The direction of associations in All of Us and NHANES matched for almost all comparisons, but differed in magnitude for some conditions, primarily clinical diagnoses. PAFs were generally higher in All of Us. Predictors of mortality in All of Us do not consistently generalize to the U.S. population.

All of Us,32273199,Incidence trends of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma in Italy from 1990 to 2015.,"The incidence of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma has increased for decades in most Western countries - a trend virtually restricted to women aged <50 or 60 years. In southern Europe, conversely, the trends have been insufficiently studied. This article reports a study from Italy. Thirty-eight local cancer registries, currently covering 15,274,070 women, equivalent to 49.2% of the Italian national female population, participated. Invasive cancers registered between 1990 and 2015 with an International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd revision, topography code C51 and morphology codes compatible with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (n = 6294) were eligible. Incidence trends were analysed using joinpoint regression models, with calculation of the estimated annual percent change (EAPC), and age-period-cohort models. Total incidence showed a regular and significant decreasing trend (EAPC, -0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.43 to -0.48). This was entirely accounted for by women aged ≥60 years (EAPC, -1.34; 95% CI, -1.86 to -0.81). For younger women, the EAPC between 1990 and 2012 was 1.20 (95% CI, 0.34 to 2.06) with a non-significant acceleration thereafter. This pattern did not vary substantially in a sensitivity analysis for the effect of geographic area and duration of the registry. The age-period-cohort analysis revealed a risk decrease in cohorts born between 1905 and 1940 and a new increase in cohorts born since 1945. The decreasing trend observed among older women and the resulting decrease in total rate are at variance with reports from most Western countries. Age-period-cohort analysis confirmed a decreasing trend for earliest birth cohorts and an opposite one for recent ones.","Mancini, Silvia; Bucchi, Lauro; Baldacchini, Flavia; Giuliani, Orietta; Ravaioli, Alessandra; Vattiato, Rosa; Preti, Mario; Tumino, Rosario; Ferretti, Stefano; Biggeri, Annibale; Brustolin, Angelita; Boschetti, Lorenza; Caiazzo, Anna L; Caldarella, Adele; Cesaraccio, Rosaria; Cirilli, Claudia; Citarella, Annarita; Filiberti, Rosa A; Fusco, Mario; Galasso, Rocco; Gatti, Luciana; Lotti, Fernanda L; Magoni, Michele; Mangone, Lucia; Masanotti, Giuseppe; Mazzoleni, Guido; Mazzucco, Walter; Melcarne, Anna; Michiara, Maria; Pesce, Paola; Piffer, Silvano; Pinto, Angela; Rognoni, Magda; Rosso, Stefano; Rugge, Massimo; Sampietro, Giuseppe; Scalzi, Santo; Scuderi, Tiziana; Tagliabue, Giovanna; Tisano, Francesco; Toffolutti, Federica; Vitarelli, Susanna; Falcini, Fabio",Gynecologic oncology,2020,"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Female; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Incidence; Italy; Middle Aged; Vulvar Neoplasms",Age-period-cohort modelling; Incidence; Trend; Vulvar neoplasms,"Romagna Cancer Registry, Romagna Cancer Institute, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Forlì, Italy.; Romagna Cancer Registry, Romagna Cancer Institute, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Forlì, Italy.; Romagna Cancer Registry, Romagna Cancer Institute, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Forlì, Italy.; Romagna Cancer Registry, Romagna Cancer Institute, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Forlì, Italy.; Romagna Cancer Registry, Romagna Cancer Institute, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Forlì, Italy.

Data of patients with BMs from RCC were retrospectively collected. Age, sex, ECOG-Performance Status (PS), MSKCC group, tumor histology, presence of concomitant metastases to other sites, time from nephrectomy to bone metastases (TTBM, classified into three groups: <1 year, between 1 and 5 years and >5 years) and time from BMs to skeletal-related event (SRE) were included in the Cox analysis to investigate their prognostic relevance. 470 patients were enrolled in this analysis. In 19 patients (4%),bone was the only metastatic site; 277 patients had concomitant metastases in other sites. Median time to BMs was 16 months (range 0 - 44y) with Median OS of 17 months. Number of metastatic sites (including bone, p = 0.01), concomitant metastases, high Fuhrman grade (p < 0.001) and non-clear cell histology (p = 0.013) were significantly associated with poor prognosis. Patients with TTBM >5 years had longer OS (22 months) compared to patients with TTBM <1 year (13 months) or between 1 and 5 years (19 months) from nephrectomy (p < 0.001), no difference was found between these two last groups (p = 0.18). At multivariate analysis, ECOG-PS, MSKCC group and concomitant lung or lymph node metastases were independent predictors of OS in patients with BMs. Our study suggest that age, ECOG-PS, histology, MSKCC score, TTBM and the presence of concomitant metastases should be considered in order to optimize the management of RCC patients with BMs.","Santoni, Matteo; Conti, Alessandro; Procopio, Giuseppe; Porta, Camillo; Ibrahim, Toni; Barni, Sandro; Guida, Francesco Maria; Fontana, Andrea; Berruti, Alfredo; Berardi, Rossana; Massari, Francesco; Vincenzi, Bruno; Ortega, Cinzia; Ottaviani, Davide; Carteni, Giacomo; Lanzetta, Gaetano; De Lisi, Delia; Silvestris, Nicola; Satolli, Maria Antonietta; Collovà, Elena; Russo, Antonio; Badalamenti, Giuseppe; Luzi Fedeli, Stefano; Tanca, Francesca Maria; Adamo, Vincenzo; Maiello, Evaristo; Sabbatini, Roberto; Felici, Alessandra; Cinieri, Saverio; Montironi, Rodolfo; Bracarda, Sergio; Tonini, Giuseppe; Cascinu, Stefano; Santini, Daniele",Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,2015,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bone Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Female; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis",,"Department of Medical Oncology, AOU Ospedali Riuniti, Università Politecnica delle, Marche, Ancona, Italy. mattymo@alice.it.; Department of Clinical and Specialist Sciences, Urology, Università Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy. alessandro.conti@hotmail.com.; Department of Medical Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy. giuseppe.procopio@istitutotumori.mi.it.; Division of Medical Oncology, I.R.C.C.S.

All of Us,34097045,A Mendelian Randomization Approach Using 3-HMG-Coenzyme-A Reductase Gene Variation to Evaluate the Association of Statin-Induced Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Lowering With Noncardiovascular Disease Phenotypes.,"Observational studies suggest that statins, which inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, may be associated with beneficial effects in many noncardiovascular diseases. To construct a weighted HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) gene genetic risk score (GRS) using variants in the HMGCR gene affecting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as an instrumental variable for mendelian randomization analyses to test associations with candidate noncardiovascular phenotypes previously associated with statin use in observational studies. This cohort study included 53 385 unrelated adults of European ancestry with genome-wide genotypes available from BioVU (a practice-based biobank, used for discovery) and 30 444 unrelated adults with European ancestry available in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE; a research consortium that conducts genetic research using electronic medical records, used for replication). The study was conducted from February 6, 2015, through April 31, 2019; data analysis was performed from August 26, 2019, through December 22, 2020. An HMGCR GRS was calculated. The association between the HMGCR GRS and the presence or absence of 22 noncardiovascular phenotypes previously associated with statin use in clinical studies. Of the 53 385 individuals in BioVU, 29 958 (56.1%) were women; mean (SD) age was 59.9 (15.6) years. The finding between the HMGCR GRS and the noncardiovascular phenotypes of interest in this cohort was significant only for type 2 diabetes. An HMGCR GRS equivalent to a 10-mg/dL decrease in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04-1.15; P = 5.58 × 10-4). The HMGCR GRS was not associated with other phenotypes; the closest were increased risk of Parkinson disease (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.07-1.58; P = .007) and kidney failure (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05-1.34; P = .008). Of the 30 444 individuals in eMERGE, 16 736 (55.0%) were women; mean (SD) age was 68.7 (15.4) years. The association between the HMGCR GRS and type 2 diabetes was replicated in this cohort (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17; P = .02); however, the HMGCR GRS was not associated with Parkinson disease (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.75-1.16; P = .53) and kidney failure (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.98-1.41; P = .08) in the eMERGE cohort. A mendelian randomization approach using variants in the HMGCR gene replicated the association between statin use and increased type 2 diabetes risk but provided no strong evidence for pleiotropic effects of statin-induced decrease of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level on other diseases.","Liu, Ge; Shi, Mingjian; Mosley, Jonathan D; Weng, Chunhua; Zhang, Yanfei; Lee, Ming Ta Michael; Jarvik, Gail P; Hakonarson, Hakon; Namjou-Khales, Bahram; Sleiman, Patrick; Luo, Yuan; Mentch, Frank; Denny, Joshua C; Linton, MacRae F; Wei, Wei-Qi; Stein, C Michael; Feng, QiPing",JAMA network open,2021,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cholesterol, LDL; Cohort Studies; Europe; Female; Genetic Variation; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Hypercholesterolemia; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Phenotype",,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger Health System, Danville, Pennsylvania.; Musculoskeletal Institute, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger Health System, Danville, Pennsylvania.; Musculoskeletal Institute, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania.; Department of Medicine, Division of Medical Genetics, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle.; Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle.; The Center for Applied Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.; Department of Pediatrics, The Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Division of Human Genetics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.; Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.; UC Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio.; The Center for Applied Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.; Department of Pediatrics, The Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Division of Human Genetics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.; Department of Preventive Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.; The Center for Applied Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; at the time of the study, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; All of Us Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; now, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.12820

Retrospective cohort study. Individuals aged 40 years or older with linked electronic health record (EHR) data in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) All of Us dataset. Participants with a diagnosis of POAG prior to use of NRTIs were excluded. A cohort of 1:10 NRTI users to non-users was created using a propensity score matching design, considering age, race, sex at birth, HIV diagnosis, hepatitis B diagnosis, and family history of POAG. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to adjust for residual imbalance. Sensitivity analyses were performed for self-reported eye doctor visits. Diagnosis of POAG. Among the 305441 All of Us participants aged 40 or older with a linked EHR, we identified 718 individuals (0.24%) with NRTI use, excluding participants with a diagnosis of POAG before NRTI exposure. The rate of POAG in the NRTI users was 4.32% (N=31). The rate of POAG in the propensity score-matched control group (N=7180) was 2.00% (N=144). Use of NRTI was associated with an increased risk of POAG (odds ratio [OR]: 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48-3.28, P < 0.001). When adjusting for residual imbalance of family history of POAG, HIV diagnosis, and hepatitis B diagnosis, use of any NRTIs remained significantly associated with an increased risk of developing POAG (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.22-2.77, P = 0.004). After matching and adjusting for self-reported eye doctor visits, NRTIs remained significantly associated with POAG risk (OR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.07-4.96, P = 0.033).

All of Us,40442974,PTPN2 and Leukopenia in Individuals With Normal TPMT and NUDT15 Metabolizer Status Taking Azathioprine.,"Leukopenia is a common dose-dependent side effect of azathioprine, often leading to drug discontinuation. Variants in TPMT and NUDT15 are associated with azathioprine-induced leukopenia but only explain 25% of cases. Thus, we aimed to identify novel genetic risk factors among TPMT and NUDT15 normal metabolizers through a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Using BioVU, Vanderbilt's electronic health record linked to genetic data, we assembled a discovery cohort of new users of azathioprine. The analysis was conducted in 1184 new users of azathioprine who had no history of prior thiopurine use or an organ transplant. A replication cohort of 521 patients was derived from All of Us, an NIH-funded project that links healthcare data and genetics. The GWAS was adjusted for sex, age, indication (inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, other autoimmune condition, or unknown), concurrent use of xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol or febuxostat) or immunosuppressants, prior TPMT or NUDT15 testing, and 10 principal components of ancestry. In BioVU, 65% of patients were female with a median age of 44 [IQR: 30, 57] and 125 patients developed leukopenia.

All of Us,39313475,Cost-Related Medication Behaviors for Patients With and Without Systemic Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases.,"Medication nonadherence challenges the management of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs). We investigated cost-related medication behaviors among patients with SARDs, and compared them to those of patients without SARDs, in a large diverse cohort across the United States. As part of the All of Us (version 7), a nationwide diverse adult cohort with linked electronic health records begun in 2017, participants completed questionnaires concerning cost-related medication behaviors. Chi-square tests compared responses between patients with SARDs, by disease and medication type, and to those without SARDs. Logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]). We analyzed data from 3,997 patients with SARDs and 73,990 participants without SARDs. After adjustment, patients with versus without SARDs had 1.56 times increased odds of reporting unaffordability of prescription medicines (95% CI 1.43-1.70), 1.43 times increased odds of cost-related medication nonadherence (95% CI 1.31-1.56), and 1.23 times increased odds of using cost-reducing strategies (95% CI 1.14-1.32). Patients with SARDs who reported unaffordability were 16.5% less likely to receive a disease-modifying drug (95% CI 0.70-0.99) but 18.1% more likely to receive glucocorticoids (95% CI 0.99-1.42). In addition, unaffordability of prescription medicines was likely to have 1.27 times increased odds of one to two emergency room visits per year (95% CI 1.03-1.57) and 1.38-fold increased odds of three or more emergency room visits per year (95% CI 0.96-1.99). In this large diverse cohort, patients with versus without SARDs had more self-reported cost-related medication behaviors, and those who reported medication unaffordability received fewer disease-modifying drugs and had more emergency room visits.","Yee, Jeong; Feldman, Candace H; Oakes, Emily G; Ellrodt, Jack; Guan, Hongshu; Choi, May Y; Karlson, Elizabeth W; Costenbader, Karen H",Arthritis care & research,2025,Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Rheumatic Diseases; Adult; Autoimmune Diseases; Aged; Antirheumatic Agents; United States; Drug Costs; Medication Adherence; Surveys and Questionnaires,,"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.",10.1002/acr.25442

The comparison analysis includes variables related to behavioral and systemic health, health literacy, and overall health status across race, ethnicity, and gender. The analytic approach used descriptive statistics, Chi-square, odds ratio, and 95% confidence intervals; significant comparisons were measured with Cohen's D effect sizes. In the AoU dataset, 80.6% of Hispanic or Latino participants reported alcohol use compared to 16.8% in the BigMouth data repository. The female cohort in AoU showed 87.9% alcohol use, a contrast to BigMouth's 26.0%. Additionally, the diabetes prevalence among females was 8.8% in AoU vs. 21.6% in BigMouth. Differences in health literacy were observed, with 49.2% among Hispanic or Latino participants in AoU, in contrast to BigMouth's 3.2%. Despite this, 70.1% of Hispanic or Latino respondents in AoU reported satisfactory health status, while BigMouth indicated a much higher figure at 98.3%. These variations highlight the importance of targeted health interventions addressing racial/ethnic and gender influences. Differences may arise from recruitment approaches, participant demographics, and healthcare access. There is a need for collaboration, standardized data collection, and inclusive recruitment to remedy these discrepancies. Further research is imperative to understand the underlying causes, facilitate interventions that address the disparities, and advocate for a more inclusive healthcare system.","Nasiha Maliq, Nihmath; Ong, Toan; Giano, Zachary; Rivera, William; Tiwari, Tamanna",Frontiers in oral health,2024,,behavioral health; big data; electronic health record; health literacy; systemic health,"School of Dental Medicine, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, United States.; School of Medicine, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, United States.; School of Public Health, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, United States.; School of Dental Medicine, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, United States.; School of Dental Medicine, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, United States.",10.3389/froh.2024.1427109

However, real-world effectiveness data are scarce, and aim of this analysis was to assess clinical outcomes in young patients with T1D switching from 1st generation basal insulin (1BI) to Gla-300. ISPED CARD is a retrospective, multicenter study, based on data anonymously extracted from Electronic Medical Records. The study involved a network of 20 pediatric diabetes centers. Data on all patients aged < 18 years with T1D switching from 1BI to Gla-300 were analyzed to assess clinical characteristics at the switch and changes after 6 and 12 months in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and standardized body mass index (BMI/SDS). Titration of basal and short-acting insulin doses was also evaluated. Overall, 200 patients were identified. The mean age at the switch to Gla-300 was 13 years, and mean duration of diabetes was 3.9 years. Average HbA1c levels at switch were 8.8%. After 6 months, HbA1c levels decreased by - 0.88% (95% CI - 1.28; - 0.48; p < 0.0001). The benefit was maintained after 12 months from the switch (mean reduction of HbA1c levels - 0.80%, 95% CI - 1.25; - 0.35, p = 0.0006). Trends of reduction in FBG levels were also evidenced both at 6 months and 12 months. No significant changes in short-acting and basal insulin doses were documented. The study provides the first real-world evidence of the effectiveness of Gla-300 in children and adolescents with T1D previously treated with 1BI. The benefits in terms of HbA1c levels reduction were substantial, and sustained after 12 months. Additional benefits can be expected by improving the titration of insulin doses.","Rossi, Maria Chiara; Bonfanti, Riccardo; Graziano, Giusi; Larosa, Monica; Lombardo, Fortunato; Nicolucci, Antonio; Vespasiani, Giacomo; Zucchini, Stefano; Rabbone, Ivana",Acta diabetologica,2024,"Adolescent; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Blood Glucose; Databases, Factual; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Drug Substitution; Glycated Hemoglobin; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Insulin Glargine; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",Glargine 300 U/mL; Pediatric diabetes; Real-world evidence; Type 1 diabetes,"CORESEARCH - Center for Outcomes Research and Clinical Epidemiology, Pescara, Italy. rossi@coresearch.it.; Pediatric Diabetology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Diabetes Research Institute, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.; CORESEARCH - Center for Outcomes Research and Clinical Epidemiology, Pescara, Italy.; Medical Affairs, Sanofi S.R.L., Milan, Italy.; Department of Human Pathology in Adult and Developmental Age ""Gaetano Barresi"", University of Messina, Messina, Italy.; CORESEARCH - Center for Outcomes Research and Clinical Epidemiology, Pescara, Italy.; Meteda Srl, San Benedetto del Tronto, AP, Italy.; Department of Pediatric, IRCCS AOU Bologna, Bologna, Italy.; Division of Pediatrics, Department of Health Sciences, Università del Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy.",10.1007/s00592-024-02304-2

We performed transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to construct gene expression signatures of AD from publicly available GWAS summary statistics, using both transcriptome prediction models for 49 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and microglia-specific models trained on eQTL data from the Microglia Genomic Atlas (MiGA). We then identified compounds capable of reversing the AD-associated changes in gene expression observed in these signatures by querying the Connectivity Map (CMap) drug perturbation database. Out of >2,000 small-molecule compounds in CMap, aspirin emerged as the most promising AD repurposing candidate.

We explored the deliberations, decisions, and challenges faced by the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network during the implementation of a genomic research project recommending clinical care based on high-risk results defined largely by polygenic risk scores. Two surveys were disseminated to eMERGE sites: to identify preferences about payment for specific care recommendations (survey 1) and to understand the operational processes of covering medical care costs (survey 2). Paying for a subset of care recommendations for the funded study duration was identified as the most feasible approach for covering medical care costs for participants who received high-risk genomic results. Each eMERGE site, by necessity, used diverse approaches to pay for medical care costs. eMERGE researchers balanced competing concerns about bias, equity, study design, regulatory compliance, and cost in designing a unified approach to cover some of the recommended medical care costs in the study. Many implementation challenges were encountered. Findings can inform researchers and regulatory bodies about the implications and complications of covering medical care costs in translational research studies focused on prevention.","Rasmussen-Torvik, Laura J; Bonini, Katherine E; Harr, Margaret H; Abbass, Mohammad Ali; Bangash, Hana; Bland, Harris T; Boyd, Brenna M; Chung, Wendy K; Clayton, Ellen W; Cohen, Stuart J; Connolly, John J; Gascoigne, Catherine; Hernandez, Valentina; Holm, Ingrid A; Horike-Pyne, Martha; Jarvik, Gail P; Karlson, Elizabeth W; Kullo, Iftikhar J; Limdi, Nita A; Maradik, Mary E; McNally, Elizabeth M; Perez, Emma; Prows, Cynthia A; Shaibi, Gabriel Q; Weng, Chunhua; Rowley, Robb K; Peterson, Josh F; Linder, Jodell E; Sabatello, Maya",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2025,,Genomic medicine; Research compliance; Research ethics; Study design; Translational genomics,"Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL; Center for Genetic Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL.

All of Us,40319838,HDL Cholesterol Is Remarkably Cardioprotective Against Coronary Artery Disease in Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.,"High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is inversely associated with cardiometabolic risk and exhibits nonlinear effects at extreme levels. Cardiometabolic diseases are a leading cause of death and are particularly prevalent among Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs). This study characterizes HDL-C's association with coronary artery disease (CAD), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in NHPIs compared to the general population. Using electronic health record data from the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program, we applied Cox proportional hazards models to compare HDL-C's protective effects on CAD, MACE, and T2D between 261 NHPIs and the remaining cohort (n = 188,802). Models were adjusted for key confounders, and restricted cubic splines were used to assess nonlinear risk dynamics. Tracking individuals across 10,534,661 person-years (mean age 55.7 ± 15.8 years, 38% male), HDL-C was more strongly associated with reduced CAD risk in NHPIs (HR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.19-0.54) than in the general cohort (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.56-0.58). A marginally stronger association was observed for MACE (NHPI HR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.23-0.71 vs general HR: = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.53-0.56), while T2D associations were similar. Spline analysis indicated that low HDL-C increases risk for both CAD and T2D in NHPIs. HDL-C's protective role against cardiometabolic diseases is more pronounced in NHPIs, particularly for CAD. These findings support further investigation into tailored clinical assessments for this population.","Szatrowski, Austin; Maggio, Zane; Khomtchouk, Bohdan",JACC.

In a retrospective study, we assessed the routine use of first-line sunitinib in mRCC patients aged ≥ 70 years. We reviewed the clinical files of 185 patients aged ≥ 70 years with mRCC treated with first-line sunitinib in 17 Italian oncology units from February 2006 to September 2011. One hundred twenty-three patients (66.5%) received a standard 50 mg/d for a 4 weeks on/2 weeks off regimen (SR), and 62 patients (33.5%) received an AR consisting of 37.5 mg/d for a 4 weeks on/2 weeks off in 67.7% of cases. Median age was 74 years. Patients treated with an AR were older than those treated with the SR (P < .0001). In the overall population, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 25.5 months. Grade 3-4 toxicities occurred in 87 of 123 SR (70.7%) and 32 of 62 AR (51.6%), respectively; dose reductions were required in 82 SR (66.7%) and 26 AR (41.9%), respectively; discontinuations because of therapy-related adverse events occurred in 25 SR (20.3%) and 15 AR (24.2%), respectively.

All of Us,27029881,[Preliminary results and future perspectives of the Piedmont Adult Congenital Heart Disease Registry].,"Adults with congenital heart disease are a relatively new population that progressively increases in size and complexity. In Italy, there are no accurate data concerning the distribution of congenital defects and the long-term outcome relating to both congenital heart disease per se and comorbidities, due to the aging process. The Piedmont Adult Congenital Heart Disease Registry has been designed to investigate these aspects and to support a high quality healthcare development for grown-up congenital heart patients. Within 2 years, 459 consecutive patients routinely followed in 10 divisions of cardiology in Piedmont were included in the project. Electronic dedicated software has supported data collection. Mean age of patients is 35 ± 16 years. Septal defects are the most common type of congenital heart disease (35.3%). At baseline evaluation, 71.7% of patients reported a previous surgical and/or percutaneous treatment and 6.3% an electrophysiological procedure. Freedom from intervention is 44%, 81% and 56% at the age of 18, 30 and 45 years, respectively. Patients who had a treatment during infancy show a better intervention-free survival (p=0.038) compared with patients treated during adulthood. Despite the majority of the population had an almost preserved functional status, 27.5% had ≥1 long-term sequelae (arrhythmias 27.5%; pulmonary hypertension 5.2%; neurological problems 4.1%; cyanosis 4.8%; liver dysfunction 2.4%; enteropathy 2.4%; lung disease 2.2%). During 2 years of follow-up, the estimated mortality rate is 0.88%. Adults with congenital heart disease are a heterogeneous population of relatively young patients with relevant clinical and social problems. The late sequelae related to both the underlying heart disease and the advancing age require continuous monitoring and lifelong specialized care.","Marzullo, Raffaella; Bordese, Roberto; Bassignana, Antonia; Ferraro, Gaetana; Dall'Orto, Giovanni; Ferrarotti, Lorena; Libertucci, Daniela; Rissone, Laura; Amoroso, Giuseppe; Actis Dato, Guglielmo; Albera, Carlo; Bergamasco, Laura; Agnoletti, Gabriella",Giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006),2016,"Adult; Angioplasty, Balloon; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Cardiology; Electronic Health Records; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Defects, Congenital; Heart Septal Defects; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Registries; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Survival Rate",,"S.C.

All of Us,40151359,Artificial Intelligence Models to Identify Patients at High Risk for Glaucoma Using Self-reported Health Data in a United States National Cohort.,"Early glaucoma detection is key to preventing vision loss, but screening often requires specialized eye examination or photography, limiting large-scale implementation. This study sought to develop artificial intelligence models that use self-reported health data from surveys to prescreen patients at high risk for glaucoma who are most in need of glaucoma screening with ophthalmic examination and imaging. Cohort study. Participants enrolled from May 1, 2018, to July 1, 2022, in the nationwide All of Us Research Program who were ≥18 years of age, had ≥2 eye-related diagnoses in their electronic health record (EHR), and submitted surveys with self-reported health history. We developed models to predict the risk of glaucoma, as determined by EHR diagnosis codes, using 3 machine learning approaches: (1) penalized logistic regression, (2) XGBoost, and (3) a fully connected neural network. Glaucoma diagnosis was identified based on International Classification of Diseases codes extracted from EHR data. An 80/20 train-test split was implemented, with cross-validation employed for hyperparameter tuning. Input features included self-reported demographics, general health, lifestyle factors, and family and personal medical history. Models were evaluated using standard classification metrics, including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Among the 8205 patients, 873 (10.64%) were diagnosed with glaucoma. Across models, AUROC scores for identifying which patients had glaucoma from survey health data ranged from 0.710 to 0.890. XGBoost achieved the highest AUROC of 0.890 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.860-0.910). Logistic regression followed with an AUROC of 0.772 (95% CI: 0.753-0.795). Explainability studies revealed that key features included traditionally recognized risk factors for glaucoma, such as age, type 2 diabetes, and a family history of glaucoma. Machine and deep learning models successfully utilized health data from self-reported surveys to predict glaucoma diagnosis without additional data from ophthalmic imaging or eye examination. These models may eventually enable prescreening for glaucoma in a wide variety of low-resource settings, after which high-risk patients can be referred for targeted screening using more specialized ophthalmic examination or imaging.

All of Us,40463526,Adaptive Transfer Learning for Time-to-Event Modeling with Applications in Disease Risk Assessment.,"To address the challenges for modeling time-to-event outcomes in small-sample settings, we propose a novel transfer learning approach, termed CoxTL, based on the widely used Cox proportional hazards model, accounting for potential covariate and concept shifts between source and target datasets. CoxTL utilizes a combination of density ratio weighting and importance weighting techniques to address multi-level data heterogeneity, including covariate and coefficient shifts between source and target datasets. Additionally, it accounts for potential model misspecification, ensuring robustness across a wide range of settings. We assess the performance of CoxTL through extensive simulation studies, considering data under various types of distributional shifts. Additionally, we apply CoxTL to predict End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) in the Hispanic population using electronic health record-derived features from the All of Us Research Program. Data from non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black populations are leveraged as source cohorts. Model performance is evaluated using the C-index and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). In simulation studies, CoxTL demonstrates higher predictive accuracy, particularly in scenarios involving multi-level heterogeneity between target and source datasets. In other scenarios, CoxTL performs comparably to alternative methods specifically designed to address only a single type of distributional shift. For predicting the 2-year risk of ESRD in the Hispanic population, CoxTL achieves an increase in C-index up to 6.76% compared to the model trained exclusively on target data. Furthermore, it demonstrates up to 17.94% increase in the C-index compared to the state-of-the-art transfer learning method based on Cox model. The proposed method effectively utilizes source data to enhance time-to-event predictions in target populations with limited samples. Its ability to handle various sources and levels of data heterogeneity ensures robustness, making it particularly well-suited for real-world applications involving target populations with small sample sizes, where traditional Cox models often struggle.","Lu, Yuying; Gu, Tian; Duan, Rui",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025,,,,10.1101/2025.01.14.25320536
All of Us,40152140,Predicting postoperative chronic opioid use with fair machine learning models integrating multi-modal data sources: a demonstration of ethical machine learning in healthcare.,"Building upon our previous work on predicting chronic opioid use using electronic health records (EHR) and wearable data, this study leveraged the Health Equity Across the AI Lifecycle (HEAAL) framework to (a) fine tune the previously built model with genomic data and evaluate model performance in predicting chronic opioid use and (b) apply IBM's AIF360 pre-processing toolkit to mitigate bias related to gender and race and evaluate the model performance using various fairness metrics. Participants included approximately 271 All of Us Research Program subjects with EHR, wearable, and genomic data. We fine-tuned 4 machine learning models on the new dataset. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique identified the best-performing predictors. A preprocessing toolkit boosted fairness by gender and race. The genetic data enhanced model performance from the prior model, with the area under the curve improving from 0.90 (95% CI, 0.88-0.92) to 0.95 (95% CI, 0.89-0.95). Key predictors included Dopamine D1 Receptor (DRD1) rs4532, general type of surgery, and time spent in physical activity. The reweighing preprocessing technique applied to the stacking algorithm effectively improved the model's fairness across racial and gender groups without compromising performance. We leveraged 2 dimensions of the HEAAL framework to build a fair artificial intelligence (AI) solution. Multi-modal datasets (including wearable and genetic data) and applying bias mitigation strategies can help models to more fairly and accurately assess risk across diverse populations, promoting fairness in AI in healthcare.","Soley, Nidhi; Rattsev, Ilia; Speed, Traci J; Xie, Anping; Ferryman, Kadija S; Taylor, Casey Overby",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2025,"Humans; Machine Learning; Electronic Health Records; Male; Female; Opioid-Related Disorders; Pain, Postoperative; Wearable Electronic Devices; Analgesics, Opioid; Middle Aged; Adult; Information Sources",All of Us; chronic opioid use; ethical machine learning; multimodal dataset; responsible AI,"Institute for Computational Medicine, Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, United States.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21218, United States.; Institute for Computational Medicine, Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, United States.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21218, United States.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States.; Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21202, United States.; Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States.; Department of Health Policy & Management, Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States.; Berman Institute of Bioethics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States.; Institute for Computational Medicine, Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, United States.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21218, United States.; Department of Health Policy & Management, Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States.; Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States.",10.1093/jamia/ocaf053

No standard therapeutic approach is available for patients with advanced disease. The aim of this phase II study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with (177)Lu-DOTATATE (Lu-PRRT) and the role of thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and (18)F-FDG PET as prognostic factors in patients with advanced TC or AC. A total of 34 consecutive patients with radiologically documented progressive disease were treated with Lu-PRRT at a therapeutic cumulative activity of 18.5 or 27.8 GBq in four or five cycles according to the patient's kidney function and bone marrow reserve. Information on TTF-1 was available in all patients. FDG PET studies prior to Lu-PRRT were available in 29 patients. The median follow-up was 29 months (range 7 - 69 months). The disease control rate (DCR) in patients with TC was 80 %: 6 % complete response, 27 % partial response and 47 % stable disease. The median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 20.1 months (95 % CI 11.8 - 26.8 months). Stable disease was achieved in 47 % of patients with AC with a mPFS of 15.7 months (95 % CI 10.6 - 25.9 months). No major acute or delayed toxicity occurred in either group or with either cumulative activity. mPFS in patients with TTF-1-negative TC was 26.3 months (95 % CI 12.9 - 45.2 months), but in patients with TTF-1-positive TC mPFS was 7.2 months (4.2 - 14.0 months; p = 0.0009). FDG PET was negative in 13 patients (10 TC and 3 AC) and positive in 16 patients (4 TC and 12 AC). The mPFS in the FDG PET-negative group was 26.4 months (95 % CI 14.2 - 48.9 months) and 15.3 months (11.7 - 31.1 months) in the FDG PET-positive group. Lu-PRRT showed antitumour activity in terms of DCR and PFS and proved safe, even in patients with a higher risk of side effects. TTF-1 would appear to be a prognostic factor. FDG PET positivity in bronchial carcinoids is a hallmark of aggressive tumour and is more frequent in patients with AC than in those with TC.","Ianniello, Annarita; Sansovini, Maddalena; Severi, Stefano; Nicolini, Silvia; Grana, Chiara Maria; Massri, Katrin; Bongiovanni, Alberto; Antonuzzo, Lorenzo; Di Iorio, Valentina; Sarnelli, Anna; Caroli, Paola; Monti, Manuela; Scarpi, Emanuela; Paganelli, Giovanni",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,2016,"Adult; Aged; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Nuclear Proteins; Octreotide; Organometallic Compounds; Positron-Emission Tomography; Receptors, Peptide; Safety; Thyroid Nuclear Factor 1; Transcription Factors",18F-FDG PET; Bronchial carcinoids; Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with 177Lu-DOTATATE; Thyroid transcription factor 1,"Nuclear Medicine and Radiometabolic Unit, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Via Maroncelli 40, 47014, Meldola, Italy.; Nuclear Medicine and Radiometabolic Unit, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Via Maroncelli 40, 47014, Meldola, Italy.; Nuclear Medicine and Radiometabolic Unit, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Via Maroncelli 40, 47014, Meldola, Italy.; Nuclear Medicine and Radiometabolic Unit, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Via Maroncelli 40, 47014, Meldola, Italy.; Division of Nuclear Medicine, European Institute of Oncology Milan (IEO), Milan, Italy.; Nuclear Medicine, Department of Radiology, Ospedale San Luca, Lucca, Italy.; Osteoncology and Rare Tumors Center, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.; SC Oncologia Medica 1, AOU Careggi, Firenze, Italy.; Oncology Pharmacy Laboratory, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.; Medical Physics Unit, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.; Nuclear Medicine and Radiometabolic Unit, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Via Maroncelli 40, 47014, Meldola, Italy.; Unit of Biostatistics and Clinical Trials, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.; Unit of Biostatistics and Clinical Trials, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola, Italy.; Nuclear Medicine and Radiometabolic Unit, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Via Maroncelli 40, 47014, Meldola, Italy. giovanni.paganelli@irst.emr.it.",10.1007/s00259-015-3262-8

Fifty-six patients (37 %) had NLR ≥3 at the start of VEGFR-TKI therapy (group A), while 95 had lower NLR (63 %, group B). The median overall survival (OS) was 28.8 months in group A and 68.7 months (95 % confidence interval (CI) 45.3-NA) in group B (p < 0.001). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 15.8 months in group A and 25.1 months in group B (p = 0.03). At multivariate analysis, MSKCC risk group and NLR were independent prognostic factors for both OS and PFS. Pretreatment NLR is an independent prognostic factor for patients with late relapsing mRCC treated with first-line VEGFR-TKIs. A better characterization of baseline immunological impairment may optimize the management of this RCC subpopulation.","Santoni, Matteo; Buti, Sebastiano; Conti, Alessandro; Porta, Camillo; Procopio, Giuseppe; Sternberg, Cora N; Bracarda, Sergio; Basso, Umberto; De Giorgi, Ugo; Rizzo, Mimma; Derosa, Lisa; Ortega, Cinzia; Massari, Francesco; Milella, Michele; Bersanelli, Melissa; Cerbone, Linda; Muzzonigro, Giovanni; Burattini, Luciano; Montironi, Rodolfo; Santini, Daniele; Cascinu, Stefano",Targeted oncology,2015,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Female; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Leukocyte Disorders; Lymphopenia; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Prognosis; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",Late recurrence; Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio; Prognosis; Renal cell carcinoma; Tyrosine kinase inhibitors,"Medical Oncology, AOU Ospedali Riuniti, Polytechnic University of the Marche Region, Via Conca 71, 60126, Ancona, Italy. mattymo@alice.it.; Oncology Unit, University Hospital of Parma, Viale Antonio Gramsci 14, 43126, Parma, Italy. sebabuti@libero.it.; Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche Specialistiche ed Odontostomatologiche, Clinica di Urologia, AOU ""Ospedali Riuniti"", Università Politecnica delle Marche, Via Conca 71, 60126, Ancona, Italy. alessandro83conti@gmail.com.; Medical Oncology, IRCCS San Matteo University Hospital Foundation, Piazzale C Golgi 19, 27100, Pavia, Italy. camillo.porta@gmail.com.; Department of Medical Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Via G.

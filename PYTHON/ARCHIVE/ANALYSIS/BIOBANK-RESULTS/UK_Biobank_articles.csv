UK Biobank,38642570,"Global incidence, prevalence, years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 371 diseases and injuries in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","Detailed, comprehensive, and timely reporting on population health by underlying causes of disability and premature death is crucial to understanding and responding to complex patterns of disease and injury burden over time and across age groups, sexes, and locations. The availability of disease burden estimates can promote evidence-based interventions that enable public health researchers, policy makers, and other professionals to implement strategies that can mitigate diseases. It can also facilitate more rigorous monitoring of progress towards national and international health targets, such as the Sustainable Development Goals. For three decades, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) has filled that need. A global network of collaborators contributed to the production of GBD 2021 by providing, reviewing, and analysing all available data. GBD estimates are updated routinely with additional data and refined analytical methods. GBD 2021 presents, for the first time, estimates of health loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The GBD 2021 disease and injury burden analysis estimated years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 371 diseases and injuries using 100 983 data sources. Data were extracted from vital registration systems, verbal autopsies, censuses, household surveys, disease-specific registries, health service contact data, and other sources. YLDs were calculated by multiplying cause-age-sex-location-year-specific prevalence of sequelae by their respective disability weights, for each disease and injury. YLLs were calculated by multiplying cause-age-sex-location-year-specific deaths by the standard life expectancy at the age that death occurred. DALYs were calculated by summing YLDs and YLLs. HALE estimates were produced using YLDs per capita and age-specific mortality rates by location, age, sex, year, and cause. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for all final estimates as the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles values of 500 draws. Uncertainty was propagated at each step of the estimation process. Counts and age-standardised rates were calculated globally, for seven super-regions, 21 regions, 204 countries and territories (including 21 countries with subnational locations), and 811 subnational locations, from 1990 to 2021. Here we report data for 2010 to 2021 to highlight trends in disease burden over the past decade and through the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Global DALYs increased from 2·63 billion (95% UI 2·44-2·85) in 2010 to 2·88 billion (2·64-3·15) in 2021 for all causes combined. Much of this increase in the number of DALYs was due to population growth and ageing, as indicated by a decrease in global age-standardised all-cause DALY rates of 14·2% (95% UI 10·7-17·3) between 2010 and 2019. Notably, however, this decrease in rates reversed during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, with increases in global age-standardised all-cause DALY rates since 2019 of 4·1% (1·8-6·3) in 2020 and 7·2% (4·7-10·0) in 2021. In 2021, COVID-19 was the leading cause of DALYs globally (212·0 million [198·0-234·5] DALYs), followed by ischaemic heart disease (188·3 million [176·7-198·3]), neonatal disorders (186·3 million [162·3-214·9]), and stroke (160·4 million [148·0-171·7]). However, notable health gains were seen among other leading communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases. Globally between 2010 and 2021, the age-standardised DALY rates for HIV/AIDS decreased by 47·8% (43·3-51·7) and for diarrhoeal diseases decreased by 47·0% (39·9-52·9). Non-communicable diseases contributed 1·73 billion (95% UI 1·54-1·94) DALYs in 2021, with a decrease in age-standardised DALY rates since 2010 of 6·4% (95% UI 3·5-9·5). Between 2010 and 2021, among the 25 leading Level 3 causes, age-standardised DALY rates increased most substantially for anxiety disorders (16·7% [14·0-19·8]), depressive disorders (16·4% [11·9-21·3]), and diabetes (14·0% [10·0-17·4]). Age-standardised DALY rates due to injuries decreased globally by 24·0% (20·7-27·2) between 2010 and 2021, although improvements were not uniform across locations, ages, and sexes. Globally, HALE at birth improved slightly, from 61·3 years (58·6-63·6) in 2010 to 62·2 years (59·4-64·7) in 2021. However, despite this overall increase, HALE decreased by 2·2% (1·6-2·9) between 2019 and 2021. Putting the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of causes of health loss is crucial to understanding its impact and ensuring that health funding and policy address needs at both local and global levels through cost-effective and evidence-based interventions. A global epidemiological transition remains underway. Our findings suggest that prioritising non-communicable disease prevention and treatment policies, as well as strengthening health systems, continues to be crucially important. The progress on reducing the burden of CMNN diseases must not stall; although global trends are improving, the burden of CMNN diseases remains unacceptably high. Evidence-based interventions will help save the lives of young children and mothers and improve the overall health and economic conditions of societies across the world. Governments and multilateral organisations should prioritise pandemic preparedness planning alongside efforts to reduce the burden of diseases and injuries that will strain resources in the coming decades.

UK Biobank,30305743,The UK Biobank resource with deep phenotyping and genomic data.,"The UK Biobank project is a prospective cohort study with deep genetic and phenotypic data collected on approximately 500,000 individuals from across the United Kingdom, aged between 40 and 69 at recruitment. The open resource is unique in its size and scope. A rich variety of phenotypic and health-related information is available on each participant, including biological measurements, lifestyle indicators, biomarkers in blood and urine, and imaging of the body and brain. Follow-up information is provided by linking health and medical records. Genome-wide genotype data have been collected on all participants, providing many opportunities for the discovery of new genetic associations and the genetic bases of complex traits. Here we describe the centralized analysis of the genetic data, including genotype quality, properties of population structure and relatedness of the genetic data, and efficient phasing and genotype imputation that increases the number of testable variants to around 96 million. Classical allelic variation at 11 human leukocyte antigen genes was imputed, resulting in the recovery of signals with known associations between human leukocyte antigen alleles and many diseases.","Bycroft, Clare; Freeman, Colin; Petkova, Desislava; Band, Gavin; Elliott, Lloyd T; Sharp, Kevin; Motyer, Allan; Vukcevic, Damjan; Delaneau, Olivier; O'Connell, Jared; Cortes, Adrian; Welsh, Samantha; Young, Alan; Effingham, Mark; McVean, Gil; Leslie, Stephen; Allen, Naomi; Donnelly, Peter; Marchini, Jonathan",Nature,2018,"Adult; Aged; Alleles; Biomarkers; Body Height; Brain; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Databases, Genetic; Electronic Health Records; Family; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Haplotypes; Humans; Life Style; Major Histocompatibility Complex; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Quality Control; Racial Groups; United Kingdom",,"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Procter & Gamble, Brussels, Belgium.; Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Melbourne Integrative Genomics and the Schools of Mathematics and Statistics, and BioSciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.; Melbourne Integrative Genomics and the Schools of Mathematics and Statistics, and BioSciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.; Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Genetic Medicine and Development, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.; Institute of Genetics and Genomics in Geneva, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.; Illumina Ltd, Chesterford Research Park, Little Chesterford, Essex, UK.; Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Division of Clinical Neurology, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; UK Biobank, Adswood, Stockport, Cheshire, UK.; Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; UK Biobank, Adswood, Stockport, Cheshire, UK.; Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Melbourne Integrative Genomics and the Schools of Mathematics and Statistics, and BioSciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.; Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.; Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. marchini@stats.ox.ac.uk.; Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. marchini@stats.ox.ac.uk.",10.1038/s41586-018-0579-z
UK Biobank,36626356,"Healthy lifestyle behaviors, mediating biomarkers, and risk of microvascular complications among individuals with type 2 diabetes: A cohort study.","The influence of overall lifestyle behaviors on diabetic microvascular complications remains unknown. In addition, the potential mediating biomarkers underlying the association is unclear. This study aimed to examine the associations of the combined lifestyle factors with risks of total and individual microvascular complications among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and to explore the potential mediation effects of metabolic biomarkers. This retrospective cohort study included 15,104 patients with T2D free of macro- and microvascular complications at baseline (2006 to 2010) from the UK Biobank. Healthy lifestyle behaviors included noncurrent smoking, recommended waist circumference, regular physical activity, healthy diet, and moderate alcohol drinking. Outcomes were ascertained using electronic health records. Over a median of 8.1 years of follow-up, 1,296 cases of the composite microvascular complications occurred, including 558 diabetic retinopathy, 625 diabetic kidney disease, and 315 diabetic neuropathy, with some patients having 2 or 3 microvascular complications simultaneously. After multivariable adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, history of hypertension, glycemic control, and medication histories, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for the participants adhering 4 to 5 low-risk lifestyle behaviors versus 0 to 1 were 0.65 (0.46, 0.91) for diabetic retinopathy, 0.43 (0.30, 0.61) for diabetic kidney disease, 0.46 (0.29, 0.74) for diabetic neuropathy, and 0.54 (0.43, 0.68) for the composite outcome (all Ps-trend ≤0.01). Further, the population-attributable fraction (95% CIs) of diabetic microvascular complications for poor adherence to the overall healthy lifestyle (<4 low-risk factors) ranged from 25.3% (10.0%, 39.4%) to 39.0% (17.7%, 56.8%). In addition, albumin, HDL-C, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A, C-reactive protein, and HbA1c collectively explained 23.20% (12.70%, 38.50%) of the associations between overall lifestyle behaviors and total diabetic microvascular complications. The key limitation of the current analysis was the potential underreporting of microvascular complications because the cases were identified via electronic health records. Adherence to overall healthy lifestyle behaviors was associated with a significantly lower risk of microvascular complications in patients with T2D, and the favorable associations were partially mediated through improving biomarkers of glycemic control, systemic inflammation, liver function, and lipid profile.","Geng, Tingting; Zhu, Kai; Lu, Qi; Wan, Zhenzhen; Chen, Xue; Liu, Liegang; Pan, An; Liu, Gang",PLoS medicine,2023,"Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Cohort Studies; Diabetic Retinopathy; Diabetic Nephropathies; Diabetic Neuropathies; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Biomarkers; Healthy Lifestyle",,"Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.",10.1371/journal.pmed.1004135
UK Biobank,38582094,"Global burden of 288 causes of death and life expectancy decomposition in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","Regular, detailed reporting on population health by underlying cause of death is fundamental for public health decision making. Cause-specific estimates of mortality and the subsequent effects on life expectancy worldwide are valuable metrics to gauge progress in reducing mortality rates. These estimates are particularly important following large-scale mortality spikes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. When systematically analysed, mortality rates and life expectancy allow comparisons of the consequences of causes of death globally and over time, providing a nuanced understanding of the effect of these causes on global populations. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 cause-of-death analysis estimated mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) from 288 causes of death by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2021. The analysis used 56 604 data sources, including data from vital registration and verbal autopsy as well as surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. As with previous GBD rounds, cause-specific death rates for most causes were estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model-a modelling tool developed for GBD to assess the out-of-sample predictive validity of different statistical models and covariate permutations and combine those results to produce cause-specific mortality estimates-with alternative strategies adapted to model causes with insufficient data, substantial changes in reporting over the study period, or unusual epidemiology. YLLs were computed as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 1000-draw distribution for each metric. We decomposed life expectancy by cause of death, location, and year to show cause-specific effects on life expectancy from 1990 to 2021. We also used the coefficient of variation and the fraction of population affected by 90% of deaths to highlight concentrations of mortality. Findings are reported in counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2021 include the expansion of under-5-years age group to include four new age groups, enhanced methods to account for stochastic variation of sparse data, and the inclusion of COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality-which includes excess mortality associated with the pandemic, excluding COVID-19, lower respiratory infections, measles, malaria, and pertussis. For this analysis, 199 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 5 country-years of surveillance data, 21 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 94 country-years of other data types were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. The leading causes of age-standardised deaths globally were the same in 2019 as they were in 1990; in descending order, these were, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infections. In 2021, however, COVID-19 replaced stroke as the second-leading age-standardised cause of death, with 94·0 deaths (95% UI 89·2-100·0) per 100 000 population. The COVID-19 pandemic shifted the rankings of the leading five causes, lowering stroke to the third-leading and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to the fourth-leading position. In 2021, the highest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (271·0 deaths [250·1-290·7] per 100 000 population) and Latin America and the Caribbean (195·4 deaths [182·1-211·4] per 100 000 population). The lowest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 were in the high-income super-region (48·1 deaths [47·4-48·8] per 100 000 population) and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (23·2 deaths [16·3-37·2] per 100 000 population). Globally, life expectancy steadily improved between 1990 and 2019 for 18 of the 22 investigated causes. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the positive effect that reductions in deaths from enteric infections, lower respiratory infections, stroke, and neonatal deaths, among others have contributed to improved survival over the study period. However, a net reduction of 1·6 years occurred in global life expectancy between 2019 and 2021, primarily due to increased death rates from COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality. Life expectancy was highly variable between super-regions over the study period, with southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania gaining 8·3 years (6·7-9·9) overall, while having the smallest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 (0·4 years). The largest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean (3·6 years). Additionally, 53 of the 288 causes of death were highly concentrated in locations with less than 50% of the global population as of 2021, and these causes of death became progressively more concentrated since 1990, when only 44 causes showed this pattern. The concentration phenomenon is discussed heuristically with respect to enteric and lower respiratory infections, malaria, HIV/AIDS, neonatal disorders, tuberculosis, and measles. Long-standing gains in life expectancy and reductions in many of the leading causes of death have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the adverse effects of which were spread unevenly among populations. Despite the pandemic, there has been continued progress in combatting several notable causes of death, leading to improved global life expectancy over the study period. Each of the seven GBD super-regions showed an overall improvement from 1990 and 2021, obscuring the negative effect in the years of the pandemic. Additionally, our findings regarding regional variation in causes of death driving increases in life expectancy hold clear policy utility. Analyses of shifting mortality trends reveal that several causes, once widespread globally, are now increasingly concentrated geographically. These changes in mortality concentration, alongside further investigation of changing risks, interventions, and relevant policy, present an important opportunity to deepen our understanding of mortality-reduction strategies. Examining patterns in mortality concentration might reveal areas where successful public health interventions have been implemented. Translating these successes to locations where certain causes of death remain entrenched can inform policies that work to improve life expectancy for people everywhere.

GBMI meta-analyzes summary statistics from GWASs generated using harmonized genotypes and phenotypes from member biobanks for 14 exemplar diseases and endpoints. This strategy validates that GWASs conducted in diverse biobanks can be integrated despite heterogeneity in case definitions, recruitment strategies, and baseline characteristics. This collaborative effort improves GWAS power for diseases, benefits understudied diseases, and improves risk prediction while also enabling the nomination of disease genes and drug candidates by incorporating gene and protein expression data and providing insight into the underlying biology of human diseases and traits.","Zhou, Wei; Kanai, Masahiro; Wu, Kuan-Han H; Rasheed, Humaira; Tsuo, Kristin; Hirbo, Jibril B; Wang, Ying; Bhattacharya, Arjun; Zhao, Huiling; Namba, Shinichi; Surakka, Ida; Wolford, Brooke N; Lo Faro, Valeria; Lopera-Maya, Esteban A; Läll, Kristi; Favé, Marie-Julie; Partanen, Juulia J; Chapman, Sinéad B; Karjalainen, Juha; Kurki, Mitja; Maasha, Mutaamba; Brumpton, Ben M; Chavan, Sameer; Chen, Tzu-Ting; Daya, Michelle; Ding, Yi; Feng, Yen-Chen A; Guare, Lindsay A; Gignoux, Christopher R; Graham, Sarah E; Hornsby, Whitney E; Ingold, Nathan; Ismail, Said I; Johnson, Ruth; Laisk, Triin; Lin, Kuang; Lv, Jun; Millwood, Iona Y; Moreno-Grau, Sonia; Nam, Kisung; Palta, Priit; Pandit, Anita; Preuss, Michael H; Saad, Chadi; Setia-Verma, Shefali; Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Uzunovic, Jasmina; Verma, Anurag; Zawistowski, Matthew; Zhong, Xue; Afifi, Nahla; Al-Dabhani, Kawthar M; Al Thani, Asma; Bradford, Yuki; Campbell, Archie; Crooks, Kristy; de Bock, Geertruida H; Damrauer, Scott M; Douville, Nicholas J; Finer, Sarah; Fritsche, Lars G; Fthenou, Eleni; Gonzalez-Arroyo, Gilberto; Griffiths, Christopher J; Guo, Yu; Hunt, Karen A; Ioannidis, Alexander; Jansonius, Nomdo M; Konuma, Takahiro; Lee, Ming Ta Michael; Lopez-Pineda, Arturo; Matsuda, Yuta; Marioni, Riccardo E; Moatamed, Babak; Nava-Aguilar, Marco A; Numakura, Kensuke; Patil, Snehal; Rafaels, Nicholas; Richmond, Anne; Rojas-Muñoz, Agustin; Shortt, Jonathan A; Straub, Peter; Tao, Ran; Vanderwerff, Brett; Vernekar, Manvi; Veturi, Yogasudha; Barnes, Kathleen C; Boezen, Marike; Chen, Zhengming; Chen, Chia-Yen; Cho, Judy; Smith, George Davey; Finucane, Hilary K; Franke, Lude; Gamazon, Eric R; Ganna, Andrea; Gaunt, Tom R; Ge, Tian; Huang, Hailiang; Huffman, Jennifer; Katsanis, Nicholas; Koskela, Jukka T; Lajonchere, Clara; Law, Matthew H; Li, Liming; Lindgren, Cecilia M; Loos, Ruth J F; MacGregor, Stuart; Matsuda, Koichi; Olsen, Catherine M; Porteous, David J; Shavit, Jordan A; Snieder, Harold; Takano, Tomohiro; Trembath, Richard C; Vonk, Judith M; Whiteman, David C; Wicks, Stephen J; Wijmenga, Cisca; Wright, John; Zheng, Jie; Zhou, Xiang; Awadalla, Philip; Boehnke, Michael; Bustamante, Carlos D; Cox, Nancy J; Fatumo, Segun; Geschwind, Daniel H; Hayward, Caroline; Hveem, Kristian; Kenny, Eimear E; Lee, Seunggeun; Lin, Yen-Feng; Mbarek, Hamdi; Mägi, Reedik; Martin, Hilary C; Medland, Sarah E; Okada, Yukinori; Palotie, Aarno V; Pasaniuc, Bogdan; Rader, Daniel J; Ritchie, Marylyn D; Sanna, Serena; Smoller, Jordan W; Stefansson, Kari; van Heel, David A; Walters, Robin G; Zöllner, Sebastian; Martin, Alicia R; Willer, Cristen J; Daly, Mark J; Neale, Benjamin M",Cell genomics,2022,,GWAS; ancestry diversity; biobank; genetic association studies; meta-analysis; phenotype harmonization,"Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Statistical Genetics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.; Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; K.G.

UK Biobank,34743566,ECG-Based Deep Learning and Clinical Risk Factors to Predict Atrial Fibrillation.,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled analysis of 12-lead ECGs may facilitate efficient estimation of incident atrial fibrillation (AF) risk. However, it remains unclear whether AI provides meaningful and generalizable improvement in predictive accuracy beyond clinical risk factors for AF. We trained a convolutional neural network (ECG-AI) to infer 5-year incident AF risk using 12-lead ECGs in patients receiving longitudinal primary care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). We then fit 3 Cox proportional hazards models, composed of ECG-AI 5-year AF probability, CHARGE-AF clinical risk score (Cohorts for Heart and Aging in Genomic Epidemiology-Atrial Fibrillation), and terms for both ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF (CH-AI), respectively. We assessed model performance by calculating discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration in an internal test set and 2 external test sets (Brigham and Women's Hospital [BWH] and UK Biobank). Models were recalibrated to estimate 2-year AF risk in the UK Biobank given limited available follow-up. We used saliency mapping to identify ECG features most influential on ECG-AI risk predictions and assessed correlation between ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF linear predictors. The training set comprised 45 770 individuals (age 55±17 years, 53% women, 2171 AF events) and the test sets comprised 83 162 individuals (age 59±13 years, 56% women, 2424 AF events). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was comparable using CHARGE-AF (MGH, 0.802 [95% CI, 0.767-0.836]; BWH, 0.752 [95% CI, 0.741-0.763]; UK Biobank, 0.732 [95% CI, 0.704-0.759]) and ECG-AI (MGH, 0.823 [95% CI, 0.790-0.856]; BWH, 0.747 [95% CI, 0.736-0.759]; UK Biobank, 0.705 [95% CI, 0.673-0.737]). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was highest using CH-AI (MGH, 0.838 [95% CI, 0.807 to 0.869]; BWH, 0.777 [95% CI, 0.766 to 0.788]; UK Biobank, 0.746 [95% CI, 0.716 to 0.776]). Calibration error was low using ECG-AI (MGH, 0.0212; BWH, 0.0129; UK Biobank, 0.0035) and CH-AI (MGH, 0.012; BWH, 0.0108; UK Biobank, 0.0001). In saliency analyses, the ECG P-wave had the greatest influence on AI model predictions. ECG-AI and CHARGE-AF linear predictors were correlated (Pearson  AI-based analysis of 12-lead ECGs has similar predictive usefulness to a clinical risk factor model for incident AF and the approaches are complementary. ECG-AI may enable efficient quantification of future AF risk.","Khurshid, Shaan; Friedman, Samuel; Reeder, Christopher; Di Achille, Paolo; Diamant, Nathaniel; Singh, Pulkit; Harrington, Lia X; Wang, Xin;

UK Biobank,36563696,Machine learning-based marker for coronary artery disease: derivation and validation in two longitudinal cohorts.,"Binary diagnosis of coronary artery disease does not preserve the complexity of disease or quantify its severity or its associated risk with death; hence, a quantitative marker of coronary artery disease is warranted. We evaluated a quantitative marker of coronary artery disease derived from probabilities of a machine learning model. In this cohort study, we developed and validated a coronary artery disease-predictive machine learning model using 95 935 electronic health records and assessed its probabilities as in-silico scores for coronary artery disease (ISCAD; range 0 [lowest probability] to 1 [highest probability]) in participants in two longitudinal biobank cohorts. We measured the association of ISCAD with clinical outcomes-namely, coronary artery stenosis, obstructive coronary artery disease, multivessel coronary artery disease, all-cause death, and coronary artery disease sequelae. Among 95 935 participants, 35 749 were from the BioMe Biobank (median age 61 years [IQR 18]; 14 599 [41%] were male and 21 150 [59%] were female; 5130 [14%] were with diagnosed coronary artery disease) and 60 186 were from the UK Biobank (median age 62 [15] years; 25 031 [42%] male and 35 155 [58%] female; 8128 [14%] with diagnosed coronary artery disease). The model predicted coronary artery disease with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0·95 (95% CI 0·94-0·95; sensitivity of 0·94 [0·94-0·95] and specificity of 0·82 [0·81-0·83]) and 0·93 (0·92-0·93; sensitivity of 0·90 [0·89-0·90] and specificity of 0·88 [0·87-0·88]) in the BioMe validation and holdout sets, respectively, and 0·91 (0·91-0·91; sensitivity of 0·84 [0·83-0·84] and specificity of 0·83 [0·82-0·83]) in the UK Biobank external test set. ISCAD captured coronary artery disease risk from known risk factors, pooled cohort equations, and polygenic risk scores. Coronary artery stenosis increased quantitatively with ascending ISCAD quartiles (increase per quartile of 12 percentage points), including risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, multivessel coronary artery disease, and stenosis of major coronary arteries. Hazard ratios (HRs) and prevalence of all-cause death increased stepwise over ISCAD deciles (decile 1: HR 1·0 [95% CI 1·0-1·0], 0·2% prevalence; decile 6: 11 [3·9-31], 3·1% prevalence; and decile 10: 56 [20-158], 11% prevalence). A similar trend was observed for recurrent myocardial infarction. 12 (46%) undiagnosed individuals with high ISCAD (≥0·9) had clinical evidence of coronary artery disease according to the 2014 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force guidelines. Electronic health record-based machine learning was used to generate an in-silico marker for coronary artery disease that can non-invasively quantify atherosclerosis and risk of death on a continuous spectrum, and identify underdiagnosed individuals.

UK Biobank,37678743,Nuclear Magnetic Resonance-Based Metabolomics and Risk of CKD.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to lipid and metabolic abnormalities, but a comprehensive investigation of lipids, lipoprotein particles, and circulating metabolites associated with the risk of CKD has been lacking. We examined the associations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics data with CKD risk in the UK Biobank study. Observational cohort study. A total of 91,532 participants in the UK Biobank Study without CKD and not receiving lipid-lowering therapy. Levels of metabolites including lipid concentration and composition within 14 lipoprotein subclasses, as well as other metabolic biomarkers were quantified via NMR spectroscopy. Incident CKD identified using ICD codes in any primary care data, hospital admission records, or death register records. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We identified 2,269 CKD cases over a median follow-up period of 13.1 years via linkage with the electronic health records. After adjusting for covariates and correcting for multiple testing, 90 of 142 biomarkers were significantly associated with incident CKD. In general, higher concentrations of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles were associated with a higher risk of CKD whereas higher concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles were associated with a lower risk of CKD. Higher concentrations of cholesterol, phospholipids, and total lipids within VLDL were associated with a higher risk of CKD, whereas within HDL they were associated with a lower risk of CKD. Further, higher triglyceride levels within all lipoprotein subclasses, including all HDL particles, were associated with greater risk of CKD. We also identified that several amino acids, fatty acids, and inflammatory biomarkers were associated with risk of CKD. Potential underreporting of CKD cases because of case identification via electronic health records. Our findings highlight multiple known and novel pathways linking circulating metabolites to the risk of CKD. The relationship between individual lipoprotein particle subclasses and lipid-related traits and risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in general population is unclear. Using data from 91,532 participants in the UK Biobank, we evaluated the associations of metabolites measured using nuclear magnetic resonance testing with the risk of CKD. We identified that 90 out of 142 lipid biomarkers were significantly associated with incident CKD. We found that very-low-density lipoproteins, high-density lipoproteins, the lipid concentration and composition within these lipoproteins, triglycerides within all the lipoprotein subclasses, fatty acids, amino acids, and inflammation biomarkers were associated with CKD risk. These findings advance our knowledge about mechanistic pathways that may contribute to the development of CKD.","Geng, Ting-Ting; Chen, Jun-Xiang; Lu, Qi; Wang, Pei-Lu; Xia, Peng-Fei; Zhu, Kai; Li, Yue; Guo, Kun-Quan; Yang, Kun; Liao, Yun-Fei; Zhou, Yan-Feng; Liu, Gang; Pan, An",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2024,"Humans; Lipoproteins; Lipoproteins, HDL; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Lipoproteins, VLDL; Triglycerides; Biomarkers; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic",Biomarkers; NMR; UK Biobank; chronic kidney disease; metabolomics,"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.; Department of Epidemiology, T.H.

UK Biobank,36912851,"Physical Frailty, Genetic Predisposition, and Incident Parkinson Disease.","Cross-sectional evidence implicates high prevalent frailty in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), whereas the longitudinal association remains unknown. To examine the longitudinal association of the frailty phenotype with the development of PD and to explore the modification role of genetic risk of PD in such an association. This prospective cohort study launched in 2006 to 2010 with a follow-up of 12 years. Data were analyzed from March 2022 to December 2022. The UK Biobank recruited over 500 000 middle-aged and older adults from 22 assessment centers across the United Kingdom. Participants who were younger than 40 years (n = 101), diagnosed with dementia or PD at baseline, and developed dementia, PD, or died within 2 years from baseline were excluded (n = 4050). Participants who had no genetic data or mismatch between genetic sex and reported gender (n = 15 350), were not of self-reported British White descent (n = 27 850), and had no data for frailty assessment (n = 100 450) or any covariates were also excluded (n = 39 706). The final analysis included 314 998 participants. The physical frailty was assessed by the Fried criteria's frailty phenotype through 5 domains, ie, weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, slow walking speed, and low grip strength. The polygenic risk score (PRS) for PD comprised 44 single-nucleotide variants. New-onset PD was identified through the hospital admission electronic health records and death register. Among 314 998 participants (mean age, 56.1 years; 49.1% male), 1916 new-onset PD cases were documented. Compared with nonfrailty, the hazard ratio (HR) of incident PD in prefrailty and frailty was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.15-1.39) and 1.87 (95% CI, 1.53-2.28), respectively, and the absolute rate difference per 100 000 person-years was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.0-2.3) for prefrailty and 5.1 (95% CI, 2.9-7.3) for frailty. Exhaustion (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.22-1.62), slow gait speed (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.13-1.54), low grip strength (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.13-1.43), and low physical activity (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00-1.25) were associated with incident PD. A significant interaction between frailty and PRS on PD was found and the highest hazard was observed in participants with frailty and high genetic risk. Physical prefrailty and frailty were associated with incident PD independent of sociodemographic factors, lifestyles, multiple morbidities, and genetic background. These findings may have implications for the assessment and management of frailty for PD prevention.","Zheng, Zekun; Lv, Yanling; Rong, Shuang; Sun, Taoping; Chen, Liangkai",JAMA neurology,2023,Male; Humans; Aged; Female; Frailty; Frail Elderly; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Prospective Studies; Parkinson Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dementia,,"Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Medical College, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Zhuhai Precision Medicine Center, Zhuhai People's Hospital, Zhuhai Hospital Affiliated with Jinan University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.",10.1001/jamaneurol.2023.0183

UK Biobank,38837130,Sodium Intake and Atopic Dermatitis.,"The association of diet with atopic dermatitis (AD) remains poorly understood and could help explain heterogeneity in disease course. To determine the extent to which a higher level of dietary sodium intake, estimated using urine sodium as a biomarker, is associated with AD in a large, population-based cohort. This cross-sectional study of adult participants (aged 37-73 years) from the UK Biobank examined 24-hour urine sodium excretion, which was estimated using a single spot urine sample collected between March 31, 2006, and October 1, 2010, and calculations from the sex-specific International Cooperative Study on Salt, Other Factors, and Blood Pressure equation, incorporating body mass index; age; and urine concentrations of potassium, sodium, and creatinine. The data were analyzed between February 23, 2022, and March 20, 2024. The primary exposure was 24-hour urinary sodium excretion. The primary outcome was AD or active AD based on diagnostic and prescription codes from linked electronic medical records. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, Townsend Deprivation Index, and education were used to measure the association. The analytic sample comprised 215 832 participants (mean [SD] age, 56.52 [8.06] years; 54.3% female). Mean (SD) estimated 24-hour urine sodium excretion was 3.01 (0.82) g per day, and 10 839 participants (5.0%) had a diagnosis of AD. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that a 1-g increase in estimated 24-hour urine sodium excretion was associated with increased odds of AD (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.14), increased odds of active AD (AOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.28), and increased odds of increasing severity of AD (AOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.15). In a validation cohort of 13 014 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a 1 g per day higher dietary sodium intake estimated using dietary recall questionnaires was associated with a higher risk of current AD (AOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01-1.47). These findings suggest that restriction of dietary sodium intake may be a cost-effective and low-risk intervention for AD.","Chiang, Brenda M; Ye, Morgan; Chattopadhyay, Aheli; Halezeroglu, Yagmur; Van Blarigan, Erin L; Abuabara, Katrina",JAMA dermatology,2024,"Humans; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Adult; Dermatitis, Atopic; Aged; Sodium, Dietary; United Kingdom; Sodium; Biomarkers; Risk Factors",,"Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Urology, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco.; Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, Berkeley.",10.1001/jamadermatol.2024.1544
UK Biobank,40049185,"Global, regional, and national prevalence of child and adolescent overweight and obesity, 1990-2021, with forecasts to 2050: a forecasting study for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","Despite the well documented consequences of obesity during childhood and adolescence and future risks of excess body mass on non-communicable diseases in adulthood, coordinated global action on excess body mass in early life is still insufficient. Inconsistent measurement and reporting are a barrier to specific targets, resource allocation, and interventions. In this Article we report current estimates of overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence, progress over time, and forecasts to inform specific actions. Using established methodology from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021, we modelled overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence from 1990 to 2021, and then forecasted to 2050. Primary data for our models included 1321 unique measured and self-reported anthropometric data sources from 180 countries and territories from survey microdata, reports, and published literature. These data were used to estimate age-standardised global, regional, and national overweight prevalence and obesity prevalence (separately) for children and young adolescents (aged 5-14 years, typically in school and cared for by child health services) and older adolescents (aged 15-24 years, increasingly out of school and cared for by adult services) by sex for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. Prevalence estimates from 1990 to 2021 were generated using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models, which leveraged temporal and spatial correlation in epidemiological trends to ensure comparability of results across time and geography. Prevalence forecasts from 2022 to 2050 were generated using a generalised ensemble modelling approach assuming continuation of current trends. For every age-sex-location population across time (1990-2050), we estimated obesity (vs overweight) predominance using the log ratio of obesity percentage to overweight percentage. Between 1990 and 2021, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents doubled, and that of obesity alone tripled. By 2021, 93·1 million (95% uncertainty interval 89·6-96·6) individuals aged 5-14 years and 80·6 million (78·2-83·3) aged 15-24 years had obesity. At the super-region level in 2021, the prevalence of overweight and of obesity was highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and the greatest increase from 1990 to 2021 was seen in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Taiwan [province of China], Maldives, and China). By 2021, for females in both age groups, many countries in Australasia (eg, Australia) and in high-income North America (eg, Canada) had already transitioned to obesity predominance, as had males and females in a number of countries in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Qatar) and Oceania (eg, Cook Islands and American Samoa). From 2022 to 2050, global increases in overweight (not obesity) prevalence are forecasted to stabilise, yet the increase in the absolute proportion of the global population with obesity is forecasted to be greater than between 1990 and 2021, with substantial increases forecast between 2022 and 2030, which continue between 2031 and 2050. By 2050, super-region obesity prevalence is forecasted to remain highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and forecasted increases in obesity are still expected to be largest across southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Timor-Leste and North Korea), but also in south Asia (eg, Nepal and Bangladesh). Compared with those aged 15-24 years, in most super-regions (except Latin America and the Caribbean and the high-income super-region) a greater proportion of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity than overweight by 2050. Globally, 15·6% (12·7-17·2) of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity by 2050 (186 million [141-221]), compared with 14·2% (11·4-15·7) of those aged 15-24 years (175 million [136-203]). We forecasted that by 2050, there will be more young males (aged 5-14 years) living with obesity (16·5% [13·3-18·3]) than overweight (12·9% [12·2-13·6]); while for females (aged 5-24 years) and older males (aged 15-24 years), overweight will remain more prevalent than obesity. At a regional level, the following populations are forecast to have transitioned to obesity (vs overweight) predominance before 2041-50: children and adolescents (males and females aged 5-24 years) in north Africa and the Middle East and Tropical Latin America; males aged 5-14 years in east Asia, central and southern sub-Saharan Africa, and central Latin America; females aged 5-14 years in Australasia; females aged 15-24 years in Australasia, high-income North America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa; and males aged 15-24 years in high-income North America. Both overweight and obesity increased substantially in every world region between 1990 and 2021, suggesting that current approaches to curbing increases in overweight and obesity have failed a generation of children and adolescents. Beyond 2021, overweight during childhood and adolescence is forecast to stabilise due to further increases in the population who have obesity. Increases in obesity are expected to continue for all populations in all world regions. Because substantial change is forecasted to occur between 2022 and 2030, immediate actions are needed to address this public health crisis.

UK Biobank,37578795,Lifestyle Factors in the Association of Shift Work and Depression and Anxiety.,"Shift work may lead to adverse health outcomes. Whether shift work is associated with depression and anxiety, and to what extent lifestyle mediates the associations, remains unknown. To explore the associations of shift work, its type, frequency, and working years with anxiety and depression and to examine the potential mediating role of lifestyles. This cohort study included 175 543 employed or self-employed workers who participated in the UK Biobank baseline survey (2006-2010). Data analysis was conducted from November 2022 to January 2023. Employment and shift work status information was obtained from baseline. Lifestyles included smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, dietary characteristics, sleep duration, sedentary time, and body mass index (BMI). Depression and anxiety were identified based on electronic health records. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate the association of shift work with anxiety and depression, and cause mediation analyses we used to test the mediating role of lifestyle factors in this association. Of the 175 543 included participants (mean [SD] age, 52.6 [7.1] years; 88 290 men [50.3%]; 167 495 White participants [95.4%]), 27 637 participants (16.2%) reported shift work. During a median (IQR) follow-up of 9.06 (8.35-9.75) years, 3956 workers (2.3%) developed depression and 2838 (1.7%) developed anxiety. In the fully adjusted model, individuals who reported engaging in shift work, or shift workers, had a higher risk of depression (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.12-1.33; P < .001) and anxiety (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04-1.28; P < .001), and the risk was positively associated with shift frequency. Among shift workers, there was no significant difference between night shifts and nonnight shifts. In the dose-association analyses, years of shift work were negatively associated with the risk of depression and anxiety. Smoking, sedentary time, BMI, and sleep duration were identified as the main potentially modifiable mediators. These mediators together explained 31.3% of the association between shift work and depression and 21.2% of the association between shift work and anxiety. In this cohort study, shift work was significantly associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety, and lifestyle factors partially mediated the associations. These findings not only support that shift work should be considered an occupational hazard, but also provide evidence for the urgent need for the development of public health interventions that promote healthy lifestyles aimed at improving the mental health of shift workers.","Xu, Minzhi; Yin, Xiaoxv; Gong, Yanhong",JAMA network open,2023,Male; Humans; Middle Aged; Cohort Studies; Shift Work Schedule; Depression; Life Style; Anxiety,,"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.; Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.; Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.28798
UK Biobank,34743558,Deep Learning of the Retina Enables Phenome- and Genome-Wide Analyses of the Microvasculature.,"The microvasculature, the smallest blood vessels in the body, has key roles in maintenance of organ health and tumorigenesis. The retinal fundus is a window for human in vivo noninvasive assessment of the microvasculature. Large-scale complementary machine learning-based assessment of the retinal vasculature with phenome-wide and genome-wide analyses may yield new insights into human health and disease. We used 97 895 retinal fundus images from 54 813 UK Biobank participants. Using convolutional neural networks to segment the retinal microvasculature, we calculated vascular density and fractal dimension as a measure of vascular branching complexity. We associated these indices with 1866 incident  Low retinal vascular fractal dimension and density were significantly associated with higher risks for incident mortality, hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal failure, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, anemia, and multiple ocular conditions, as well as corresponding quantitative traits. Genome-wide association of vascular fractal dimension and density identified 7 and 13 novel loci, respectively, that were enriched for pathways linked to angiogenesis (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, angiopoietin, and WNT signaling pathways) and inflammation (eg, interleukin, cytokine signaling). Our results indicate that the retinal vasculature may serve as a biomarker for future cardiometabolic and ocular disease and provide insights into genes and biological pathways influencing microvascular indices. Moreover, such a framework highlights how deep learning of images can quantify an interpretable phenotype for integration with electronic health record, biomarker, and genetic data to inform risk prediction and risk modification.","Zekavat, Seyedeh Maryam;

UK Biobank,36669514,Association of social isolation and loneliness with risk of incident hospital-treated infections: an analysis of data from the UK Biobank and Finnish Health and Social Support studies.,"Although loneliness and social isolation have been linked to an increased risk of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and dementia, their association with the risk of severe infection is uncertain. We aimed to examine the associations between loneliness and social isolation and the risk of hospital-treated infections using data from two independent cohort studies. We assessed the association between loneliness and social isolation and incident hospital-treated infections using data for participants from the UK Biobank study aged 38-73 years at baseline and participants from the nationwide population-based Finnish Health and Social Support (HeSSup) study aged 20-54 years at baseline. For inclusion in the study, participants had to be linked to national health registries, have no history of hospital-treated infections at or before baseline, and have complete data on loneliness or social isolation. Participants with missing data on hospital-treated infections, loneliness, and social isolation were excluded from both cohorts. The outcome was defined as a hospital admission with a primary diagnosis of infection, ascertained via linkage to electronic health records. After exclusion of 8·6 million participants for not responding or not providing appropriate consent, the UK Biobank cohort consisted of 456 905 participants (249 586 women and 207 319 men). 26 860 (6·2%) of 436 001 participants with available data were reported as being lonely and 40 428 (9·0%) of 448 114 participants with available data were socially isolated. During a median 8·9 years (IQR 8·0-9·6) of follow-up, 51 361 participants were admitted to hospital due to an infectious disease. After adjustment for age, sex, demographic and lifestyle factors, and morbidities, loneliness was associated with an increased risk of a hospital-treated infection (hazard ratio [HR] 1·12 [95% CI 1·07-1·16]), whereas social isolation was not (HR 1·01 [95% CI 0·97-1·04]). Of 64 797 individuals in the HeSSup cohort, 18 468 (11 367 women and 7101 men) were eligible for inclusion. 4466 (24·4%) of 18 296 were lonely and 1776 (9·7%) of 18 376 socially isolated. During a median follow-up of 10·0 years (IQR 10·0-10·1), 814 (4·4%) participants were admitted to hospital for an infectious disease. The HRs for the HeSSup study replicated those in the UK Biobank (multivariable-adjusted HR for loneliness 1·32 [95% CI 1·06-1·64]; 1·08 [0·87-1·35] for social isolation). Loneliness might increase susceptibility to severe infections, although the magnitude of this effect appears modest and residual confounding cannot be excluded. Interventional studies are required before policy recommendations can advance.

UK Biobank,38175645,The Role of Circadian Rhythms and Sleep in Anorexia Nervosa.,"Observational studies have associated anorexia nervosa with circadian rhythms and sleep traits. However, the direction of causality and the extent of confounding by psychosocial comorbidities in these associations are unknown. To investigate the association between anorexia nervosa and circadian and sleep traits through mendelian randomization and to test the associations between a polygenic risk score (PRS) for anorexia nervosa and sleep disorders in a clinical biobank. This genetic association study used bidirectional 2-sample mendelian randomization with summary-level genetic associations between anorexia nervosa (from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium) and chronotype and sleep traits (primarily from the UK Biobank). The inverse-variance weighted method, in addition to other sensitivity approaches, was used. From the clinical Mass General Brigham (MGB) Biobank (n = 47 082), a PRS for anorexia nervosa was calculated for each patient and associations were tested with prevalent sleep disorders derived from electronic health records. Patients were of European ancestry. All analyses were performed between February and August 2023. Genetic instruments for anorexia nervosa, chronotype, daytime napping, daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and sleep duration. Chronotype, sleep traits, risk of anorexia nervosa, and sleep disorders derived from a clinical biobank. The anorexia nervosa genome-wide association study included 16 992 cases (87.7%-97.4% female) and 55 525 controls (49.6%-63.4% female). Genetic liability for anorexia nervosa was associated with a more morning chronotype (β = 0.039; 95% CI, 0.006-0.072), and conversely, genetic liability for morning chronotype was associated with increased risk of anorexia nervosa (β = 0.178; 95% CI, 0.042-0.315). Associations were robust in sensitivity and secondary analyses. Genetic liability for insomnia was associated with increased risk of anorexia nervosa (β = 0.369; 95% CI, 0.073-0.666); however, sensitivity analyses indicated bias due to horizontal pleiotropy. The MGB Biobank analysis included 47 082 participants with a mean (SD) age of 60.4 (17.0) years and 25 318 (53.8%) were female. A PRS for anorexia nervosa was associated with organic or persistent insomnia in the MGB Biobank (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17). No associations were evident for anorexia nervosa with other sleep traits. The results of this study suggest that in contrast to other metabo-psychiatric diseases, anorexia nervosa is a morningness eating disorder and further corroborate findings implicating insomnia in anorexia nervosa. Future studies in diverse populations and with subtypes of anorexia nervosa are warranted.","Wilcox, Hannah; Paz, Valentina; Saxena, Richa; Winkelman, John W; Garfield, Victoria; Dashti, Hassan S",JAMA network open,2024,Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Anorexia Nervosa; Circadian Rhythm; Genetic Risk Score; Genome-Wide Association Study; Sleep; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Adult; Aged,,"Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston.; Instituto de Psicología Clínica, Facultad de Psicología, Universidad de la República, Montevideo, Uruguay.; MRC Unit for Lifelong Health & Ageing, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston.; Division of Sleep Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Broad Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Division of Sleep Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Sleep Disorders Clinical Research Program, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston.; MRC Unit for Lifelong Health & Ageing, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston.; Division of Sleep Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Broad Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Division of Nutrition, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.50358
UK Biobank,37236697,"Identifying subtypes of heart failure from three electronic health record sources with machine learning: an external, prognostic, and genetic validation study.","Machine learning has been used to analyse heart failure subtypes, but not across large, distinct, population-based datasets, across the whole spectrum of causes and presentations, or with clinical and non-clinical validation by different machine learning methods. Using our published framework, we aimed to discover heart failure subtypes and validate them upon population representative data. In this external, prognostic, and genetic validation study we analysed individuals aged 30 years or older with incident heart failure from two population-based databases in the UK (Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD] and The Health Improvement Network [THIN]) from 1998 to 2018. Pre-heart failure and post-heart failure factors (n=645) included demographic information, history, examination, blood laboratory values, and medications. We identified subtypes using four unsupervised machine learning methods (K-means, hierarchical, K-Medoids, and mixture model clustering) with 87 of 645 factors in each dataset. We evaluated subtypes for (1) external validity (across datasets); (2) prognostic validity (predictive accuracy for 1-year mortality); and (3) genetic validity (UK Biobank), association with polygenic risk score (PRS) for heart failure-related traits (n=11), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (n=12). We included 188 800, 124 262, and 9573 individuals with incident heart failure from CPRD, THIN, and UK Biobank, respectively, between Jan 1, 1998, and Jan 1, 2018. After identifying five clusters, we labelled heart failure subtypes as (1) early onset, (2) late onset, (3) atrial fibrillation related, (4) metabolic, and (5) cardiometabolic. In the external validity analysis, subtypes were similar across datasets (c-statistics: THIN model in CPRD ranged from 0·79 [subtype 3] to 0·94 [subtype 1], and CPRD model in THIN ranged from 0·79 [subtype 1] to 0·92 [subtypes 2 and 5]). In the prognostic validity analysis, 1-year all-cause mortality after heart failure diagnosis (subtype 1 0·20 [95% CI 0·14-0·25], subtype 2 0·46 [0·43-0·49], subtype 3 0·61 [0·57-0·64], subtype 4 0·11 [0·07-0·16], and subtype 5 0·37 [0·32-0·41]) differed across subtypes in CPRD and THIN data, as did risk of non-fatal cardiovascular diseases and all-cause hospitalisation. In the genetic validity analysis the atrial fibrillation-related subtype showed associations with the related PRS. Late onset and cardiometabolic subtypes were the most similar and strongly associated with PRS for hypertension, myocardial infarction, and obesity (p<0·0009). We developed a prototype app for routine clinical use, which could enable evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Across four methods and three datasets, including genetic data, in the largest study of incident heart failure to date, we identified five machine learning-informed subtypes, which might inform aetiological research, clinical risk prediction, and the design of heart failure trials.

UK Biobank,38521087,"Global fertility in 204 countries and territories, 1950-2021, with forecasts to 2100: a comprehensive demographic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","Accurate assessments of current and future fertility-including overall trends and changing population age structures across countries and regions-are essential to help plan for the profound social, economic, environmental, and geopolitical challenges that these changes will bring. Estimates and projections of fertility are necessary to inform policies involving resource and health-care needs, labour supply, education, gender equality, and family planning and support. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 produced up-to-date and comprehensive demographic assessments of key fertility indicators at global, regional, and national levels from 1950 to 2021 and forecast fertility metrics to 2100 based on a reference scenario and key policy-dependent alternative scenarios. To estimate fertility indicators from 1950 to 2021, mixed-effects regression models and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression were used to synthesise data from 8709 country-years of vital and sample registrations, 1455 surveys and censuses, and 150 other sources, and to generate age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) for 5-year age groups from age 10 years to 54 years. ASFRs were summed across age groups to produce estimates of total fertility rate (TFR). Livebirths were calculated by multiplying ASFR and age-specific female population, then summing across ages 10-54 years. To forecast future fertility up to 2100, our Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) forecasting model was based on projections of completed cohort fertility at age 50 years (CCF50; the average number of children born over time to females from a specified birth cohort), which yields more stable and accurate measures of fertility than directly modelling TFR. CCF50 was modelled using an ensemble approach in which three sub-models (with two, three, and four covariates variously consisting of female educational attainment, contraceptive met need, population density in habitable areas, and under-5 mortality) were given equal weights, and analyses were conducted utilising the MR-BRT (meta-regression-Bayesian, regularised, trimmed) tool. To capture time-series trends in CCF50 not explained by these covariates, we used a first-order autoregressive model on the residual term. CCF50 as a proportion of each 5-year ASFR was predicted using a linear mixed-effects model with fixed-effects covariates (female educational attainment and contraceptive met need) and random intercepts for geographical regions. Projected TFRs were then computed for each calendar year as the sum of single-year ASFRs across age groups. The reference forecast is our estimate of the most likely fertility future given the model, past fertility, forecasts of covariates, and historical relationships between covariates and fertility. We additionally produced forecasts for multiple alternative scenarios in each location: the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for education is achieved by 2030; the contraceptive met need SDG is achieved by 2030; pro-natal policies are enacted to create supportive environments for those who give birth; and the previous three scenarios combined. Uncertainty from past data inputs and model estimation was propagated throughout analyses by taking 1000 draws for past and present fertility estimates and 500 draws for future forecasts from the estimated distribution for each metric, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) given as the 2·5 and 97·5 percentiles of the draws. To evaluate the forecasting performance of our model and others, we computed skill values-a metric assessing gain in forecasting accuracy-by comparing predicted versus observed ASFRs from the past 15 years (2007-21). A positive skill metric indicates that the model being evaluated performs better than the baseline model (here, a simplified model holding 2007 values constant in the future), and a negative metric indicates that the evaluated model performs worse than baseline. During the period from 1950 to 2021, global TFR more than halved, from 4·84 (95% UI 4·63-5·06) to 2·23 (2·09-2·38). Global annual livebirths peaked in 2016 at 142 million (95% UI 137-147), declining to 129 million (121-138) in 2021. Fertility rates declined in all countries and territories since 1950, with TFR remaining above 2·1-canonically considered replacement-level fertility-in 94 (46·1%) countries and territories in 2021. This included 44 of 46 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which was the super-region with the largest share of livebirths in 2021 (29·2% [28·7-29·6]). 47 countries and territories in which lowest estimated fertility between 1950 and 2021 was below replacement experienced one or more subsequent years with higher fertility; only three of these locations rebounded above replacement levels. Future fertility rates were projected to continue to decline worldwide, reaching a global TFR of 1·83 (1·59-2·08) in 2050 and 1·59 (1·25-1·96) in 2100 under the reference scenario. The number of countries and territories with fertility rates remaining above replacement was forecast to be 49 (24·0%) in 2050 and only six (2·9%) in 2100, with three of these six countries included in the 2021 World Bank-defined low-income group, all located in the GBD super-region of sub-Saharan Africa. The proportion of livebirths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa was forecast to increase to more than half of the world's livebirths in 2100, to 41·3% (39·6-43·1) in 2050 and 54·3% (47·1-59·5) in 2100. The share of livebirths was projected to decline between 2021 and 2100 in most of the six other super-regions-decreasing, for example, in south Asia from 24·8% (23·7-25·8) in 2021 to 16·7% (14·3-19·1) in 2050 and 7·1% (4·4-10·1) in 2100-but was forecast to increase modestly in the north Africa and Middle East and high-income super-regions. Forecast estimates for the alternative combined scenario suggest that meeting SDG targets for education and contraceptive met need, as well as implementing pro-natal policies, would result in global TFRs of 1·65 (1·40-1·92) in 2050 and 1·62 (1·35-1·95) in 2100. The forecasting skill metric values for the IHME model were positive across all age groups, indicating that the model is better than the constant prediction. Fertility is declining globally, with rates in more than half of all countries and territories in 2021 below replacement level. Trends since 2000 show considerable heterogeneity in the steepness of declines, and only a small number of countries experienced even a slight fertility rebound after their lowest observed rate, with none reaching replacement level. Additionally, the distribution of livebirths across the globe is shifting, with a greater proportion occurring in the lowest-income countries. Future fertility rates will continue to decline worldwide and will remain low even under successful implementation of pro-natal policies. These changes will have far-reaching economic and societal consequences due to ageing populations and declining workforces in higher-income countries, combined with an increasing share of livebirths among the already poorest regions of the world.

UK Biobank,33982892,Assessing the Causal Relationships Between Insulin Resistance and Hyperuricemia and Gout Using Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization.,"Hyperuricemia is closely associated with insulin resistance syndrome (and its many cardiometabolic sequelae); however, whether they are causally related has long been debated. We undertook this study to investigate the potential causal nature and direction between insulin resistance and hyperuricemia, along with gout, by using bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. We used genome-wide association data (n = 288,649 for serum urate [SU] concentration; n = 763,813 for gout risk; n = 153,525 for fasting insulin) to select genetic instruments for 2-sample MR analyses, using multiple MR methods to address potential pleiotropic associations. We then used individual-level, electronic medical record-linked data from the UK Biobank (n = 360,453 persons of European ancestry) to replicate our analyses via single-sample MR analysis. Genetically determined SU levels, whether inferred from a polygenic score or strong individual loci, were not associated with fasting insulin concentrations. In contrast, genetically determined fasting insulin concentrations were positively associated with SU levels (0.37 mg/dl per log-unit increase in fasting insulin [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.15, 0.58]; P = 0.001). This persisted in outlier-corrected (β = 0.56 mg/dl [95% CI 0.45, 0.67]) and multivariable MR analyses adjusted for BMI (β = 0.69 mg/dl [95% CI 0.53, 0.85]) (P < 0.001 for both). Polygenic scores for fasting insulin were also positively associated with SU level among individuals in the UK Biobank (P < 0.001). Findings for gout risk were bidirectionally consistent with those for SU level. These findings provide evidence to clarify core questions about the close association between hyperuricemia and insulin resistance syndrome: hyperinsulinemia leads to hyperuricemia but not the other way around. Reducing insulin resistance could lower the SU level and gout risk, whereas lowering the SU level (e.g., allopurinol treatment) is unlikely to mitigate insulin resistance and its cardiometabolic sequelae.","McCormick, Natalie; O'Connor, Mark J; Yokose, Chio; Merriman, Tony R; Mount, David B; Leong, Aaron; Choi, Hyon K","Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",2021,"Adult; Aged; Female; Genetic Loci; Gout; Humans; Hyperuricemia; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Uric Acid",,"Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, and Arthritis Research Canada, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada.; Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand, and University of Alabama at Birmingham.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, VA Boston Healthcare System, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, and Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, and Arthritis Research Canada, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada.",10.1002/art.41779
UK Biobank,39078629,"Visual Impairment, Eye Conditions, and Diagnoses of Neurodegeneration and Dementia.","Vision and eye conditions are associated with increased risk for Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRDs), but the nature of the association and the underlying biological pathways remain unclear. If causal, vision would be an important modifiable risk factor with viable population-level interventions. To evaluate potentially causal associations between visual acuity, eye conditions (specifically cataracts and myopia), neuroimaging outcomes, and ADRDs. A cohort and 2-sample bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted using UK Biobank participants and summary statistics from previously published genome-wide association studies on cataract, myopia, and AD. The participants included in the analysis were aged 55 to 70 years without dementia at baseline (calendar years 2006 to 2010), underwent genotyping, and reported on eye conditions; a subset completed visual acuity examinations (n = 69 852-71 429) or brain imaging (n = 36 591-36 855). Data were analyzed from August 15, 2022, through November 28, 2023. Self-reported cataracts, visual acuity, and myopia measured by refraction error. ADRD, AD, and vascular dementia were identified from electronic medical records. Total and regional brain volumes were determined using magnetic resonance imaging. The sample included 304 953 participants (mean [SD] age, 62.1 (4.1) years; 163 825 women [53.72%]); 14 295 (4.69%) had cataracts and 2754 (3.86%) had worse than 20/40 vision. Cataracts (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07-1.29) and myopia (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06-1.70) were associated with a higher hazard of ADRD. In MR analyses to estimate potential causal effects, cataracts were associated with increased risk of vascular dementia (inverse variance-weighted odds ratio [OR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.26-2.92) but were not associated with increased dementia (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.98-1.50). There were no associations between myopia and dementia. In MR for potential reverse causality, AD was not associated with cataracts (inverse variance-weighted OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96-1.01). Genetic risk for cataracts was associated with smaller total brain (β = -597.43 mm3; 95% CI, -1077.87 to -117.00 mm3) and gray matter (β = -375.17 mm3; 95% CI, -680.10 to -70.24 mm3) volumes, but not other brain regions. In this cohort and MR study of UK Biobank participants, cataracts were associated with increased risk of dementia, especially vascular dementia, and reduced total brain volumes. These findings lend further support to the hypothesis that cataract extraction may reduce the risk for dementia.","Ferguson, Erin L; Thoma, Mary; Buto, Peter T; Wang, Jingxuan; Glymour, M Maria; Hoffmann, Thomas J; Choquet, Hélène; Andrews, Shea J; Yaffe, Kristine; Casaletto, Kaitlin; Brenowitz, Willa D",JAMA network open,2024,Humans; Female; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Cataract; Dementia; Myopia; Risk Factors; Alzheimer Disease; Vision Disorders; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; United Kingdom; Cohort Studies; Visual Acuity; Genome-Wide Association Study; Neurodegenerative Diseases,,"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Division of Research, Oakland.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of California, San Francisco.; Memory and Aging Center, Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco.; Memory and Aging Center, Department of Neurology, Weill Institute for Neurosciences, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research, Portland, Oregon.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.24539
UK Biobank,39989277,Plasma Proteomic Profiles Predict Individual Future Osteoarthritis Risk.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a widespread degenerative joint disease that causes a considerable socioeconomic burden. Despite progress in genetic and environmental insights, early diagnosis is still limited by the lack of evident symptoms during the initial phases and accurate biomarkers. This study aims to identify plasma proteins associated with future risk of OA and develop a predictive model. We conducted a large-scale proteomic analysis of 45,307 participants from the UK Biobank, excluding those with baseline OA. Plasma samples were assayed using the Olink Explore Proximity Extension Assay targeting 1,463 unique proteins. Clinical variables and OA outcomes were extracted and linked to electronic health records. A predictive model was constructed using the LightGBM machine learning method, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were applied to evaluate the importance of variables. We identified a panel of proteins significantly associated with the risk of developing OA. Notably, after adjusting for multiple confounders, collagen type IX alpha 1 chain (COL9A1) and cartilage acidic protein 1 (CRTAC1) were the most significant predictors of incident OA, with hazard ratios of 1.54 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.48-1.61) and 1.65 (95% CI 1.54-1.78), respectively. SHAP analysis allowed a profound interpretation of the contribution of each protein and clinical variable to the model, revealing the multifactorial nature of OA risk prediction. The temporal trajectories of plasma proteins indicated that the levels of COL9A1 and CRTAC1 began to deviate from normal for more than a decade before OA onset, suggesting their potential use in early detection strategies. The predictive model, developed using the LightGBM algorithm, integrated proteins with clinical covariates and demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.729 for 5-year OA prediction, 0.721 for 10-year prediction, and 0.723 for all incident OA. The predictive accuracy of the model was further enhanced for hip and knee OA, achieving AUCs of 0.820 and 0.803 for 5-year predictions. Our study identified the role of plasma proteomics in predicting future OA risk, which could contribute to preemptive measures. The innovative model, which integrates proteomic biomarkers with clinical data, offers a potential tool for risk assessment, potentially optimizing OA management strategies and enhancing prevention efforts.","Kang, Zijian; Zhang, Jianzheng; Liu, Wenxin; Zhu, Chen; Zhu, Ying; Li, Ping; Li, Kai; Tong, Qiang; Dai, Sheng-Ming","Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",2025,,,"Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.; The Fourth Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Beijing, China.; Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.; China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.; The Eighth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.; Donghua University, Shanghai, China.; Donghua University, Shanghai, China.; Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China, and Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.; Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.",10.1002/art.43143
UK Biobank,38945128,Obesity and risk of diseases associated with hallmarks of cellular ageing: a multicohort study.,"Ageing hallmarks, characterising features of cellular ageing, have a role in the pathophysiology of many age-related diseases. We examined whether obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing such hallmark-related diseases. In this multicohort study, we included people aged 38-72 years with data on weight, height, and waist circumference measured during a clinical examination at baseline between March 13, 2006, and Oct 1, 2010, from the UK Biobank with follow-up until Nov 12, 2021. To test reproducibility of the findings (replication analysis), we used data from people aged 40 years or older included in the Finnish Public Sector study and the Finnish Health and Social Support study who responded to the study surveys, had data on BMI, and were successfully linked to electronic health records from national registers up to Dec 31, 2016. Obesity and clinical characteristics were assessed at baseline. Via linkage to national health records, participants were followed up for 83 diseases related to nine ageing hallmarks (genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication). Outcomes were the first instance of hallmark-related disease, in addition to co-occurrence of three or more hallmark-related diseases and mortality. 496 530 adults (mean age 57·0 years [SD 8·1]) from the UK Biobank were included in the primary analysis, and 83 249 (mean age 48·2 years [6·4]) adults from the Finnish cohorts were included in the replication analysis. Median follow-up was 12·7 years (IQR 12·0-13·4) in the UK Biobank and 14·0 years (8·0-15·0) in the Finnish cohorts. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and depression, UK Biobank participants with obesity (BMI ≥30·0 kg/m Obesity might have an important role in the development of diseases associated with cellular ageing.

UK Biobank,35076666,Population-Based Penetrance of Deleterious Clinical Variants.,"Population-based assessment of disease risk associated with gene variants informs clinical decisions and risk stratification approaches. To evaluate the population-based disease risk of clinical variants in known disease predisposition genes. This cohort study included 72 434 individuals with 37 780 clinical variants who were enrolled in the BioMe Biobank from 2007 onwards with follow-up until December 2020 and the UK Biobank from 2006 to 2010 with follow-up until June 2020. Participants had linked exome and electronic health record data, were older than 20 years, and were of diverse ancestral backgrounds. Variants previously reported as pathogenic or predicted to cause a loss of protein function by bioinformatic algorithms (pathogenic/loss-of-function variants). The primary outcome was the disease risk associated with clinical variants. The risk difference (RD) between the prevalence of disease in individuals with a variant allele (penetrance) vs in individuals with a normal allele was measured. Among 72 434 study participants, 43 395 were from the UK Biobank (mean [SD] age, 57 [8.0] years; 24 065 [55%] women; 2948 [7%] non-European) and 29 039 were from the BioMe Biobank (mean [SD] age, 56 [16] years; 17 355 [60%] women; 19 663 [68%] non-European). Of 5360 pathogenic/loss-of-function variants, 4795 (89%) were associated with an RD less than or equal to 0.05. Mean penetrance was 6.9% (95% CI, 6.0%-7.8%) for pathogenic variants and 0.85% (95% CI, 0.76%-0.95%) for benign variants reported in ClinVar (difference, 6.0 [95% CI, 5.6-6.4] percentage points), with a median of 0% for both groups due to large numbers of nonpenetrant variants. Penetrance of pathogenic/loss-of-function variants for late-onset diseases was modified by age: mean penetrance was 10.3% (95% CI, 9.0%-11.6%) in individuals 70 years or older and 8.5% (95% CI, 7.9%-9.1%) in individuals 20 years or older (difference, 1.8 [95% CI, 0.40-3.3] percentage points). Penetrance of pathogenic/loss-of-function variants was heterogeneous even in known disease predisposition genes, including BRCA1 (mean [range], 38% [0%-100%]), BRCA2 (mean [range], 38% [0%-100%]), and PALB2 (mean [range], 26% [0%-100%]). In 2 large biobank cohorts, the estimated penetrance of pathogenic/loss-of-function variants was variable but generally low. Further research of population-based penetrance is needed to refine variant interpretation and clinical evaluation of individuals with these variant alleles.","Forrest, Iain S; Chaudhary, Kumardeep; Vy, Ha My T; Petrazzini, Ben O; Bafna, Shantanu; Jordan, Daniel M; Rocheleau, Ghislain; Loos, Ruth J F; Nadkarni, Girish N; Cho, Judy H; Do, Ron",JAMA,2022,Aged; Biological Specimen Banks; Cohort Studies; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Humans; Loss of Function Mutation; Male; Mutation; Penetrance; United Kingdom,,"The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Medical Scientist Training Program, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Bio Me Phenomics Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Bio Me Phenomics Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Mindich Child Health and Development Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Bio Me Phenomics Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Bio Me Phenomics Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; The Bio Me Phenomics Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.",10.1001/jama.2021.23686

Here we tested associations of rare and ultrarare coding variants with the in silico score for CAD in the UK Biobank, All of Us Research Program and BioMe Biobank. We identified associations in 17 genes; of these, 14 show at least moderate levels of prior genetic, biological and/or clinical support for CAD. We also observed an excess of ultrarare coding variants in 321 aggregated CAD genes, suggesting more ultrarare variant associations await discovery.

UK Biobank,40049186,"Global, regional, and national prevalence of adult overweight and obesity, 1990-2021, with forecasts to 2050: a forecasting study for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","Overweight and obesity is a global epidemic. Forecasting future trajectories of the epidemic is crucial for providing an evidence base for policy change. In this study, we examine the historical trends of the global, regional, and national prevalence of adult overweight and obesity from 1990 to 2021 and forecast the future trajectories to 2050. Leveraging established methodology from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, we estimated the prevalence of overweight and obesity among individuals aged 25 years and older by age and sex for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2050. Retrospective and current prevalence trends were derived based on both self-reported and measured anthropometric data extracted from 1350 unique sources, which include survey microdata and reports, as well as published literature. Specific adjustment was applied to correct for self-report bias. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models were used to synthesise data, leveraging both spatial and temporal correlation in epidemiological trends, to optimise the comparability of results across time and geographies. To generate forecast estimates, we used forecasts of the Socio-demographic Index and temporal correlation patterns presented as annualised rate of change to inform future trajectories. We considered a reference scenario assuming the continuation of historical trends. Rates of overweight and obesity increased at the global and regional levels, and in all nations, between 1990 and 2021. In 2021, an estimated 1·00 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0·989-1·01) adult males and 1·11 billion (1·10-1·12) adult females had overweight and obesity. China had the largest population of adults with overweight and obesity (402 million [397-407] individuals), followed by India (180 million [167-194]) and the USA (172 million [169-174]). The highest age-standardised prevalence of overweight and obesity was observed in countries in Oceania and north Africa and the Middle East, with many of these countries reporting prevalence of more than 80% in adults. Compared with 1990, the global prevalence of obesity had increased by 155·1% (149·8-160·3) in males and 104·9% (95% UI 100·9-108·8) in females. The most rapid rise in obesity prevalence was observed in the north Africa and the Middle East super-region, where age-standardised prevalence rates in males more than tripled and in females more than doubled. Assuming the continuation of historical trends, by 2050, we forecast that the total number of adults living with overweight and obesity will reach 3·80 billion (95% UI 3·39-4·04), over half of the likely global adult population at that time. While China, India, and the USA will continue to constitute a large proportion of the global population with overweight and obesity, the number in the sub-Saharan Africa super-region is forecasted to increase by 254·8% (234·4-269·5). In Nigeria specifically, the number of adults with overweight and obesity is forecasted to rise to 141 million (121-162) by 2050, making it the country with the fourth-largest population with overweight and obesity. No country to date has successfully curbed the rising rates of adult overweight and obesity. Without immediate and effective intervention, overweight and obesity will continue to increase globally. Particularly in Asia and Africa, driven by growing populations, the number of individuals with overweight and obesity is forecast to rise substantially. These regions will face a considerable increase in obesity-related disease burden. Merely acknowledging obesity as a global health issue would be negligent on the part of global health and public health practitioners; more aggressive and targeted measures are required to address this crisis, as obesity is one of the foremost avertible risks to health now and in the future and poses an unparalleled threat of premature disease and death at local, national, and global levels.

We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7·3 million [95% UI 6·6-7·8] deaths; 10·7% [9·8-11·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160·5 million [147·8-171·6] DALYs; 5·6% [5·0-6·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93·8 million (89·0-99·3) prevalent and 11·9 million (10·7-13·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65·3% (62·4-67·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28·8% (28·3-28·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5·8% (5·7-6·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88·2% [53·4-117·7]), high ambient temperature (72·4% [51·1 to 179·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32·1% [26·7-38·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23·4% [12·7-35·7]), low physical activity (11·3% [1·8-34·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6·7% [2·5-11·6]), lead exposure (6·5% [4·5-11·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5·3% [0·5-10·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

UK Biobank,38950778,"Adherence to a planetary health diet, genetic susceptibility, and incident cardiovascular disease: a prospective cohort study from the UK Biobank.","The influence of adherence to a planetary health diet (PHD) proposed by the EAT-Lancet Commission on cardiovascular disease (CVD) is inconclusive. Besides, whether genetic susceptibility to CVD can modify the association of PHD with CVD remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the association between adherence to PHD and CVD, and to evaluate the interaction between PHD and genetic predisposition to CVD. This study included 114,165 participants who completed at least two 24-h dietary recalls and were initially free of CVD from the UK Biobank. PHD score was calculated to assess adherence to PHD. Genetic risk was evaluated using the polygenic risk score. Incidence of total CVD, ischemic heart disease (IHD), atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure (HF), and stroke were identified via electronic health records. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). During a median follow-up of 9.9 y, 10,071 (8.8%) incident CVD cases were documented. Compared with participants with the lowest adherence to PHD, HRs (95% CIs) for total CVD, IHD, AF, HF, and stroke among those with the highest adherence were 0.79 (0.74, 0.84), 0.73 (0.67, 0.79), 0.90 (0.82, 0.99), 0.69 (0.59, 0.82), and 0.88 (0.75, 1.04), respectively. No significant interaction between the genetic risk of CVD and PHD was observed. Participants with high genetic risk and low PHD score, as compared with those with low genetic risk and high PHD score, had a 48% (95% CI: 40%, 56%) higher risk of CVD. The population-attributable risk (95% CI) of CVD for poor adherence to PHD ranged from 8.79% (5.36%, 12.51%) to 14.00% (9.00%, 18.88%). These findings suggest that higher adherence to PHD was associated with lower risk of total CVD, IHD, AF, and HF in populations across all genetic risk categories.","Ye, Yi-Xiang; Chen, Jun-Xiang; Li, Yue; Lai, Yu-Wei; Lu, Qi; Xia, Peng-Fei; Franco, Oscar H; Liu, Gang; Pan, An",The American journal of clinical nutrition,2024,"Humans; Female; Cardiovascular Diseases; Male; United Kingdom; Prospective Studies; Middle Aged; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Biological Specimen Banks; Incidence; Diet, Healthy; Aged; Adult; Cohort Studies; Risk Factors; UK Biobank",CVD; EAT-Lancet diet; dietary pattern; genetic susceptibility; interaction; nutritional epidemiology,"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Global Public Health & Bioethics, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

In this study we aimed to prospectively investigate the associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms with risk of diabetic microvascular complications. This analysis included 14,709 participants with T2D who were free of microvascular complications from the UK Biobank. Incidence of diabetic microvascular complications was ascertained via electronic health records. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. Median serum 25(OH)D concentration was 40.7 nmol/L (interquartile range 27.5, 56.4). During a median of 11.2 years of follow-up, 1,370 people developed diabetic microvascular complications. Compared with participants with 25(OH)D <25 nmol/L, individuals with 25(OH)D ≥75 nmol/L had a multivariable-adjusted HR of 0.65 (95% CI 0.51, 0.84) for composite diabetic microvascular complications, 0.62 (0.40, 0.95) for diabetic retinopathy, 0.56 (0.40, 0.79) for diabetic nephropathy, and 0.48 (0.26, 0.89) for diabetic neuropathy. In addition, in comparisons with participants with 25(OH)D <25 nmol/L and minor allele homozygotes (TT of rs1544410 and GG of rs731236), the multivariable-adjusted HRs of composite diabetic microvascular complications were 0.54 (0.38, 0.78) and 0.55 (0.38, 0.80) for participants with serum 25(OH)D ≥50 nmol/L and major allele homozygotes (CC and AA), respectively, although no significant interaction was observed. Higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly associated with lower risk of diabetic microvascular complications, including diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, and diabetic neuropathy.

UK Biobank,38470988,The Difference Between Cystatin C- and Creatinine-Based Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate and Risk of Diabetic Microvascular Complications Among Adults With Diabetes: A Population-Based Cohort Study.,"The impact of the difference between cystatin C- and creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFRdiff) on diabetic microvascular complications (DMCs) remains unknown. We investigated the associations of eGFRdiff with overall DMCs and subtypes, including diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and diabetic neuropathy (DN). This prospective cohort study included 25,825 participants with diabetes free of DMCs at baseline (2006 to 2010) from the UK Biobank. eGFRdiff was calculated using both absolute difference (eGFRabdiff) and the ratio (eGFRrediff) between cystatin C- and creatinine-based calculations. Incidence of DMCs was ascertained using electronic health records. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the associations of eGFRdiff with overall DMCs and subtypes. During a median follow-up of 13.6 years, DMCs developed in 5,753 participants, including 2,752 cases of DR, 3,203 of DKD, and 1,149 of DN. Each SD decrease of eGFRabdiff was associated with a 28% higher risk of overall DMCs, 14% higher risk of DR, 56% higher risk of DKD, and 29% higher risk of DN. For each 10% decrease in eGFRrediff, the corresponding hazard ratios (95% CIs) were 1.16 (1.14, 1.18) for overall DMCs, 1.08 (1.05, 1.11) for DR, 1.29 (1.26, 1.33) for DKD, and 1.17 (1.12, 1.22) for DN. The magnitude of associations was not materially altered in any of the sensitivity analyses. Large eGFRdiff was independently associated with risk of DMCs and its subtypes. Our findings suggested monitoring eGFRdiff in the diabetes population has potential benefit for identification of high-risk patients.","He, Daijun; Gao, Bixia; Wang, Jinwei; Yang, Chao; Zhao, Ming-Hui; Zhang, Luxia",Diabetes care,2024,"Adult; Humans; Cystatin C; Creatinine; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Diabetic Nephropathies; Diabetic Retinopathy; Diabetic Neuropathies; Risk Factors; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,"Renal Division, Department of Medicine, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.; Institute of Nephrology, Key Laboratory of Renal Disease, Ministry of Health of China, and Key Laboratory of Chronic Kidney Disease Prevention and Treatment (Peking University), Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.; Research Units of Diagnosis and Treatment of Immune-mediated Kidney Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.; Renal Division, Department of Medicine, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.; Institute of Nephrology, Key Laboratory of Renal Disease, Ministry of Health of China, and Key Laboratory of Chronic Kidney Disease Prevention and Treatment (Peking University), Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.; Research Units of Diagnosis and Treatment of Immune-mediated Kidney Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.; Renal Division, Department of Medicine, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.; Institute of Nephrology, Key Laboratory of Renal Disease, Ministry of Health of China, and Key Laboratory of Chronic Kidney Disease Prevention and Treatment (Peking University), Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.; Research Units of Diagnosis and Treatment of Immune-mediated Kidney Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.; Renal Division, Department of Medicine, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.; Institute of Nephrology, Key Laboratory of Renal Disease, Ministry of Health of China, and Key Laboratory of Chronic Kidney Disease Prevention and Treatment (Peking University), Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.; Research Units of Diagnosis and Treatment of Immune-mediated Kidney Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.; Renal Division, Department of Medicine, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.; Institute of Nephrology, Key Laboratory of Renal Disease, Ministry of Health of China, and Key Laboratory of Chronic Kidney Disease Prevention and Treatment (Peking University), Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.; Research Units of Diagnosis and Treatment of Immune-mediated Kidney Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.; Renal Division, Department of Medicine, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.; Institute of Nephrology, Key Laboratory of Renal Disease, Ministry of Health of China, and Key Laboratory of Chronic Kidney Disease Prevention and Treatment (Peking University), Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.; Research Units of Diagnosis and Treatment of Immune-mediated Kidney Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.; National Institute of Health Data Science at Peking University, Beijing, China.",10.2337/dc23-2364

UK Biobank,38097619,Polygenic risk alters the penetrance of monogenic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is determined by an interplay of monogenic, polygenic, and environmental risks. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and COL4A-associated nephropathy (COL4A-AN) represent the most common forms of monogenic kidney diseases. These disorders have incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, and we hypothesize that polygenic factors explain some of this variability. By combining SNP array, exome/genome sequence, and electronic health record data from the UK Biobank and All-of-Us cohorts, we demonstrate that the genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) significantly predicts CKD among ADPKD monogenic variant carriers. Compared to the middle tertile of the GPS for noncarriers, ADPKD variant carriers in the top tertile have a 54-fold increased risk of CKD, while ADPKD variant carriers in the bottom tertile have only a 3-fold increased risk of CKD. Similarly, the GPS significantly predicts CKD in COL4A-AN carriers. The carriers in the top tertile of the GPS have a 2.5-fold higher risk of CKD, while the risk for carriers in the bottom tertile is not different from the average population risk. These results suggest that accounting for polygenic risk improves risk stratification in monogenic kidney disease.","Khan, Atlas; Shang, Ning; Nestor, Jordan G; Weng, Chunhua; Hripcsak, George; Harris, Peter C; Gharavi, Ali G; Kiryluk, Krzysztof",Nature communications,2023,"Humans; Penetrance; Polycystic Kidney, Autosomal Dominant; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Multifactorial Inheritance; Risk Factors",,"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. kk473@columbia.edu.",10.1038/s41467-023-43878-9
UK Biobank,38409228,Whole-exome sequencing in UK Biobank reveals rare genetic architecture for depression.,"Nearly two hundred common-variant depression risk loci have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the impact of rare coding variants on depression remains poorly understood. Here, we present whole-exome sequencing analyses of depression with seven different definitions based on survey, questionnaire, and electronic health records in 320,356 UK Biobank participants. We showed that the burden of rare damaging coding variants in loss-of-function intolerant genes is significantly associated with risk of depression with various definitions. We compared the rare and common genetic architecture across depression definitions by genetic correlation and showed different genetic relationships between definitions across common and rare variants. In addition, we demonstrated that the effects of rare damaging coding variant burden and polygenic risk score on depression risk are additive. The gene set burden analyses revealed overlapping rare genetic variant components with developmental disorder, autism, and schizophrenia. Our study provides insights into the contribution of rare coding variants, separately and in conjunction with common variants, on depression with various definitions and their genetic relationships with neurodevelopmental disorders.","Tian, Ruoyu; Ge, Tian; Kweon, Hyeokmoon; Rocha, Daniel B; Lam, Max; Liu, Jimmy Z; Singh, Kritika; Levey, Daniel F; Gelernter, Joel; Stein, Murray B; Tsai, Ellen A; Huang, Hailiang; Chabris, Christopher F; Lencz, Todd; Runz, Heiko; Chen, Chia-Yen",Nature communications,2024,Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Exome Sequencing; Biological Specimen Banks; Depression; UK Biobank,,"Biogen Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Dewpoint Therapeutics, Boston, MA, USA.; Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit, Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Economics, School of Business and Economics, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Autism & Developmental Medicine Institute, Geisinger Health System, Lewisburg, PA, USA.; Phenomics Analytics and Clinical Data Core, Geisinger Health System, Danville, PA, USA.; Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Division of Psychiatry Research, The Zucker Hillside Hospital, Northwell Health, Glen Oaks, NY, USA.; Institute of Behavioral Science, Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA.; North Region, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, Singapore.; Biogen Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA.; GlaxoSmithKline, Upper Providence, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Division of Genetic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; VA Connecticut Healthcare Center, West Haven, CT, USA.; VA Connecticut Healthcare Center, West Haven, CT, USA.; Departments of Psychiatry, Genetics, and Neuroscience, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; VA San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.; Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.; Biogen Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Autism & Developmental Medicine Institute, Geisinger Health System, Lewisburg, PA, USA.; Division of Psychiatry Research, The Zucker Hillside Hospital, Northwell Health, Glen Oaks, NY, USA.; Institute of Behavioral Science, Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA.; Departments of Psychiatry and Molecular Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY, USA.; Biogen Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA. heiko.runz@gmail.com.; Biogen Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA. chiayenc@gmail.com.",10.1038/s41467-024-45774-2

UK Biobank,35446370,Association of Pathogenic Variants in Hereditary Cancer Genes With Multiple Diseases.,"Knowledge about the spectrum of diseases associated with hereditary cancer syndromes may improve disease diagnosis and management for patients and help to identify high-risk individuals. To identify phenotypes associated with hereditary cancer genes through a phenome-wide association study. This phenome-wide association study used health data from participants in 3 cohorts. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Sequencing (eMERGEseq) data set recruited predominantly healthy individuals from 10 US medical centers from July 16, 2016, through February 18, 2018, with a mean follow-up through electronic health records (EHRs) of 12.7 (7.4) years. The UK Biobank (UKB) cohort recruited participants from March 15, 2006, through August 1, 2010, with a mean (SD) follow-up of 12.4 (1.0) years. The Hereditary Cancer Registry (HCR) recruited patients undergoing clinical genetic testing at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from May 1, 2012, through December 31, 2019, with a mean (SD) follow-up through EHRs of 8.8 (6.5) years. Germline variants in 23 hereditary cancer genes. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants for each gene were aggregated for association analyses. Phenotypes in the eMERGEseq and HCR cohorts were derived from the linked EHRs. Phenotypes in UKB were from multiple sources of health-related data. A total of 214 020 participants were identified, including 23 544 in eMERGEseq cohort (mean [SD] age, 47.8 [23.7] years; 12 611 women [53.6%]), 187 234 in the UKB cohort (mean [SD] age, 56.7 [8.1] years; 104 055 [55.6%] women), and 3242 in the HCR cohort (mean [SD] age, 52.5 [15.5] years; 2851 [87.9%] women). All 38 established gene-cancer associations were replicated, and 19 new associations were identified. These included the following 7 associations with neoplasms: CHEK2 with leukemia (odds ratio [OR], 3.81 [95% CI, 2.64-5.48]) and plasma cell neoplasms (OR, 3.12 [95% CI, 1.84-5.28]), ATM with gastric cancer (OR, 4.27 [95% CI, 2.35-7.44]) and pancreatic cancer (OR, 4.44 [95% CI, 2.66-7.40]), MUTYH (biallelic) with kidney cancer (OR, 32.28 [95% CI, 6.40-162.73]), MSH6 with bladder cancer (OR, 5.63 [95% CI, 2.75-11.49]), and APC with benign liver/intrahepatic bile duct tumors (OR, 52.01 [95% CI, 14.29-189.29]). The remaining 12 associations with nonneoplastic diseases included BRCA1/2 with ovarian cysts (OR, 3.15 [95% CI, 2.22-4.46] and 3.12 [95% CI, 2.36-4.12], respectively), MEN1 with acute pancreatitis (OR, 33.45 [95% CI, 9.25-121.02]), APC with gastritis and duodenitis (OR, 4.66 [95% CI, 2.61-8.33]), and PTEN with chronic gastritis (OR, 15.68 [95% CI, 6.01-40.92]). The findings of this genetic association study analyzing the EHRs of 3 large cohorts suggest that these new phenotypes associated with hereditary cancer genes may facilitate early detection and better management of cancers. This study highlights the potential benefits of using EHR data in genomic medicine.","Zeng, Chenjie; Bastarache, Lisa A; Tao, Ran; Venner, Eric; Hebbring, Scott; Andujar, Justin D; Bland, Sarah T; Crosslin, David R;

UK Biobank,39369548,Latent space representation of electronic health records for clustering dialysis-associated kidney failure subtypes.,"Kidney failure manifests in various forms, from sudden occurrences such as Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) to progressive like Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Given its intricate nature, marked by overlapping comorbidities and clinical similarities-including treatment modalities like dialysis-we sought to design and validate an end-to-end framework for clustering kidney failure subtypes. Our emphasis was on dialysis, utilizing a comprehensive dataset from the UK Biobank (UKB). We transformed raw Electronic Health Record (EHR) data into standardized matrices that incorporate patient demographics, clinical visit data, and the innovative feature of visit time-gaps. This matrix structure was achieved using a unique data cutting method. Latent space transformation was facilitated using a convolution autoencoder (ConvAE) model, which was then subjected to clustering using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means algorithms. Our transformation model effectively reduced data dimensionality, thereby accelerating computational processes. The derived latent space demonstrated remarkable clustering capacities. Through cluster analysis, two distinct groups were identified: CKD-majority (cluster 1) and a mixed group of non-CKD and some CKD subtypes (cluster 0). Cluster 1 exhibited notably low survival probability, suggesting it predominantly represented severe CKD. In contrast, cluster 0, with substantially higher survival probability, likely to include milder CKD forms and severe AKI. Our end-to-end framework effectively differentiates kidney failure subtypes using the UKB dataset, offering potential for nuanced therapeutic interventions. This innovative approach integrates diverse data sources, providing a holistic understanding of kidney failure, which is imperative for patient management and targeted therapeutic interventions.","Onthoni, Djeane Debora; Lin, Ming-Yen; Lan, Kuei-Yuan; Huang, Tsung-Hsien; Lin, Hong-Ming; Chiou, Hung-Yi; Hsu, Chih-Cheng; Chung, Ren-Hua",Computers in biology and medicine,2024,"Humans; Electronic Health Records; Renal Dialysis; Cluster Analysis; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Renal Insufficiency; Algorithms; Aged; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic",Acute kidney injury; Chronic kidney disease; Clustering; Convolutional autoencoder; Electronic health record; Kidney failure,"Institute of Population Health Sciences, National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli County, Taiwan.

UK Biobank,37814053,Age-dependent topic modeling of comorbidities in UK Biobank identifies disease subtypes with differential genetic risk.,"The analysis of longitudinal data from electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to improve clinical diagnoses and enable personalized medicine, motivating efforts to identify disease subtypes from patient comorbidity information. Here we introduce an age-dependent topic modeling (ATM) method that provides a low-rank representation of longitudinal records of hundreds of distinct diseases in large EHR datasets. We applied ATM to 282,957 UK Biobank samples, identifying 52 diseases with heterogeneous comorbidity profiles; analyses of 211,908 All of Us samples produced concordant results. We defined subtypes of the 52 heterogeneous diseases based on their comorbidity profiles and compared genetic risk across disease subtypes using polygenic risk scores (PRSs), identifying 18 disease subtypes whose PRS differed significantly from other subtypes of the same disease. We further identified specific genetic variants with subtype-dependent effects on disease risk. In conclusion, ATM identifies disease subtypes with differential genome-wide and locus-specific genetic risk profiles.","Jiang, Xilin; Zhang, Martin Jinye; Zhang, Yidong; Durvasula, Arun; Inouye, Michael; Holmes, Chris; Price, Alkes L; McVean, Gil",Nature genetics,2023,Humans; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Biological Specimen Banks; Genome-Wide Association Study; Population Health; Risk Factors; Comorbidity; Multifactorial Inheritance; United Kingdom,,"Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. xilinjiang@hsph.harvard.edu.; Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. xilinjiang@hsph.harvard.edu.; Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. xilinjiang@hsph.harvard.edu.; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

UK Biobank,38703417,Impact of loss-of-function in angiopoietin-like 4 on the human phenome.,"Carriers of the E40K loss-of-function variant in Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), have lower plasma triglyceride levels as well as lower rates of coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). These genetic data suggest ANGPTL4 inhibition as a potential therapeutic target for cardiometabolic diseases. However, it is unknown whether the association between E40K and human diseases is due to linkage disequilibrium confounding. The broader impact of genetic ANGPTL4 inhibition is also unknown, raising uncertainties about the safety and validity of this target. To assess the impact of ANGPLT4 inhibition, we evaluated whether E40K and other loss-of-function variants in ANGPTL4 influenced a wide range of health markers and diseases using 29 publicly available genome-wide association meta-analyses of cardiometabolic traits and diseases, as well as 1589 diseases assessed in electronic health records within FinnGen (n = 309,154). To determine whether these relationships were likely causal, and not driven by other correlated variants, we used the Bayesian fine mapping algorithm CoPheScan. The CoPheScan posterior probability of E40K being the causal variant for triglyceride levels was 99.99 %, validating the E40K to proxy lifelong lower activity of ANGPTL4. The E40K variant was associated with lower risk of CAD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.84, 95 % CI = 0.81 to 0.87, p=3.6e-21) and T2D (OR = 0.91, 95 % CI = 0.87 to 0.95, p=2.8e-05) in GWAS meta-analyses, with results replicated in FinnGen. These significant results were also replicated using other rare loss-of-function variants identified through whole exome sequencing in 488,278 participants of the UK Biobank. Using a Mendelian randomization study design, the E40K variant effect on cardiometabolic diseases was concordant with lipoprotein lipase enhancement (r = 0.82), but not hepatic lipase enhancement (r = -0.10), suggesting that ANGPTL4 effects on cardiometabolic diseases are potentially mainly mediated through lipoprotein lipase. After correction for multiple testing, the E40K variant did not significantly increase the risk of any of the 1589 diseases tested in FinnGen. ANGPTL4 inhibition may represent a potentially safe and effective target for cardiometabolic diseases prevention or treatment.","Gagnon, Eloi; Bourgault, Jérome; Gobeil, Émilie; Thériault, Sébastien; Arsenault, Benoit J",Atherosclerosis,2024,"Humans; Angiopoietin-Like Protein 4; Phenotype; Genome-Wide Association Study; Loss of Function Mutation; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Triglycerides; Coronary Artery Disease; Bayes Theorem; Risk Factors; Lipoprotein Lipase",,"Centre de Recherche de L'Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec, Québec, QC, Canada.; Centre de Recherche de L'Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec, Québec, QC, Canada.; Centre de Recherche de L'Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec, Québec, QC, Canada.; Centre de Recherche de L'Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec, Québec, QC, Canada; Department of Molecular Biology, Medical Biochemistry and Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, QC, Canada.; Centre de Recherche de L'Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec, Québec, QC, Canada; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, QC, Canada.

UK Biobank,37114803,The landscape of health disparities in the UK Biobank.,"The UK Biobank (UKB), a large-scale biomedical database that includes demographic and electronic health record data for more than half a million ethnically diverse participants, is a potentially valuable resource for the study of health disparities. However, publicly accessible databases that catalog health disparities in the UKB do not exist. We developed the UKB Health Disparities Browser with the aims of (i) facilitating the exploration of the landscape of health disparities in the UK and (ii) directing the attention to areas of disparities research that might have the greatest public health impact. Health disparities were characterized for UKB participant groups defined by age, country of residence, ethnic group, sex and socioeconomic deprivation. We defined disease cohorts for UKB participants by mapping participant International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes to phenotype codes (phecodes). For each of the population attributes used to define population groups, disease percent prevalence values were computed for all groups from phecode case-control cohorts, and the magnitude of the disparities was calculated by both the difference and ratio of the range of disease prevalence values among groups to identify high- and low-prevalence disparities. We identified numerous diseases and health conditions with disparate prevalence values across population attributes, and we deployed an interactive web browser to visualize the results of our analysis: https://ukbatlas.health-disparities.org. The interactive browser includes overall and group-specific prevalence data for 1513 diseases based on a cohort of >500 000 participants from the UKB. Researchers can browse and sort by disease prevalence and prevalence differences to visualize health disparities for each of the five population attributes, and users can search for diseases of interest by disease names or codes.

UK Biobank,39535783,Bidirectional Risk Modulator and Modifier Variant of Dilated and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in BAG3.,"The genetic factors that modulate the reduced penetrance and variable expressivity of heritable dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are largely unknown. BAG3 genetic variants have been implicated in both DCM and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), nominating BAG3 as a gene that harbors potential modifier variants in DCM. To interrogate the clinical traits and diseases associated with BAG3 coding variation. This was a cross-sectional study in the Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB) enrolling patients of the University of Pennsylvania Health System's clinical practice sites from 2014 to 2023. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was linked to electronic health record (EHR) data to associate BAG3 coding variants with EHR phenotypes. This was a health care population-based study including individuals of European and African genetic ancestry in the PMBB with WES linked to EHR phenotypes, with replication studies in BioVU, UK Biobank, MyCode, and DCM Precision Medicine Study. Carrier status for BAG3 coding variants. Association of BAG3 coding variation with clinical diagnoses, echocardiographic traits, and longitudinal outcomes. In PMBB (n = 43 731; median [IQR] age, 65 [50-76] years; 21 907 female [50.1%]), among 30 324 European and 11 198 African individuals, the common C151R variant was associated with decreased risk for DCM (odds ratio [OR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.92) and simultaneous increased risk for HCM (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.25-2.02), which was confirmed in the replication cohorts. C151R carriers exhibited improved longitudinal outcomes compared with noncarriers as assessed by age at death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.96; median [IQR] age, 71.8 [63.1-80.7] in carriers and 70.3 [61.6-79.2] in noncarriers) and heart transplant (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99; median [IQR] age, 56.7 [46.1-63.1] in carriers and 55.6 [45.2-62.9] in noncarriers). C151R was associated with reduced risk of DCM (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24-0.74) and heart failure (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14-0.50) among individuals harboring truncating TTN variants in exons with high cardiac expression (n = 358). BAG3 C151R was identified as a bidirectional modulator of risk along the DCM-HCM spectrum, as well as an important genetic modifier variant in TTN-mediated DCM. This work expands on the understanding of the etiology and penetrance of DCM, suggesting that BAG3 C151R is an important genetic modifier variant contributing to the variable expressivity of DCM, warranting further exploration of its mechanisms and of genetic modifiers in DCM more broadly.","Park, Joseph; Levin, Michael G; Zhang, David; Reza, Nosheen; Mead, Jonathan O; Carruth, Eric D; Kelly, Melissa A; Winters, Alex; Kripke, Colleen M; Judy, Renae L; Damrauer, Scott M; Owens, Anjali T; Bastarache, Lisa; Verma, Anurag; Kinnamon, Daniel D; Hershberger, Ray E; Ritchie, Marylyn D; Rader, Daniel J",JAMA cardiology,2024,"Humans; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated; Female; Male; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Aged; Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins; Exome Sequencing; Phenotype; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Echocardiography",,"Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York.; Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Division of Human Genetics, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus.; Department of Genomic Health, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania.; Department of Genomic Health, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania.; Autism and Developmental Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania.; Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Department of Surgery, Corporal Michael Crescenz VA Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.; Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Department of Surgery, Corporal Michael Crescenz VA Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.; Department of Surgery, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.; Division of Human Genetics, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus.; Division of Human Genetics, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, and the Dorothy M.

UK Biobank,37928746,Role of fatty liver index in risk-stratifying comorbid disease outcomes in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.,"Population screening for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and associated comorbidities remains an unaddressed clinical need. We aimed to assess the utility of the fatty liver index (FLI) for risk stratification of NAFLD and related comorbidities using the UK Biobank. Electronic health records and liver MRI-proton density fat fraction (PDFF) were used to define NAFLD cases. FLI was calculated and individuals with high alcohol intake and other liver diseases were excluded. Using listwise deletion analysis, the area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of FLI for NAFLD risk was determined. Thereafter, time-dependent covariate-adjusted Cox regression models were used to estimate FLI's risk stratification potential for comorbidities of interest. FLI was derived for 327,800 individuals with a median age of 58 (IQR 51.5-64.5), of whom 59.8% were females. Using Perspectum Diagnostics and AMRA protocols as references, FLI identified the risk of NAFLD with AUROCs (95% CI, n) of 0.858 (0.848-0.867, n = 7,566) and 0.851 (0.844-0.856, n = 10,777), respectively. Intermediate and high-risk FLI was associated with increased cardiometabolic and malignant disease. In the first 3 years, high-risk FLI conferred an increased risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 95% CI) of ischaemic heart disease (2.14, 1.94-2.36), hypertension (2.84, 2.70-2.98), type 2 diabetes mellitus (4.55, 4.04-5.12), dyslipidaemia (2.48, 2.32-2.64), ischaemic stroke (1.31, 1.20-1.42) and hepatic malignancy (1.69, 1.23-2.30). FLI was not associated with risk of extrahepatic malignancy but was associated with a higher risk of specific cancers (colon, upper gastrointestinal and breast). All-cause mortality was similarly stratified by FLI, independently of non-invasive fibrosis scores. FLI identifies NAFLD and holds potential for the risk stratification of cardiometabolic and malignant disease outcomes (including some extrahepatic malignancies), as well as all-cause mortality. Its use in population screening for primary and secondary prevention of NAFLD should be considered. Our analysis using the UK Biobank study shows the potential of the fatty liver index as a risk stratification tool for identifying the risk of developing NAFLD, ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, hepatic malignancy, specific metabolism-related malignancies and all-cause mortality. These results suggest that the fatty liver index should be considered as a non-invasive steatosis score that may help guide primary prevention strategies for NAFLD and related outcomes.","Ho, Brian; Thompson, Andrew; Jorgensen, Andrea L; Pirmohamed, Munir",JHEP reports : innovation in hepatology,2023,,Comorbidities; Fatty Liver Index; NAFLD; Risk Stratification; non-invasive tests,"Wolfson Centre for Personalised Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.; Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.; Wolfson Centre for Personalised Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.; Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.; Health Analytics, Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, London, UK.; Biostatistics, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.; Wolfson Centre for Personalised Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.; Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.",10.1016/j.jhepr.2023.100896

While over 1,000 genetic loci are associated with BMI, less is known about the genetic contribution to adiposity trajectories over adulthood. We derive adiposity-change phenotypes from 24.5 million primary-care health records in over 740,000 individuals in the UK Biobank, Million Veteran Program USA, and Estonian Biobank, to discover and validate the genetic architecture of adiposity trajectories. Using multiple BMI measurements over time increases power to identify genetic factors affecting baseline BMI by 14%. In the largest reported genome-wide study of adiposity-change in adulthood, we identify novel associations with BMI-change at six independent loci, including rs429358 (APOE missense variant).

UK Biobank,38264501,Constipation preceding depression: a population-based cohort study.,"Constipation is generally considered a common physical symptom of depression or a side effect of antidepressant treatments. However, according to the gut-brain axis hypothesis, the association between depression and constipation might be bi-directional. This study investigated the association between premorbid constipation and depression. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from UK Biobank. Individuals free of depression between 2006 and 2010 were included. Constipation status was determined using diagnostic codes from electronic health records or a baseline questionnaire. Data on covariates, including socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, health conditions, and regular medication use, were also collected through a baseline questionnaire. The primary outcome is incident depression, which was extracted from hospital inpatient admissions, primary care, self-report, and death data from baseline to 2022. The secondary outcome is depressive symptoms, which was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) from an online survey in 2016. Cox proportional hazard regression models were employed to assess the prospective association between constipation and incident depression. Logistic regression models were used to assess its association with depressive symptoms. Among the 449,459 participants included in the study, 18,596 (4.1%) experienced constipation at baseline, and 18,576 (4.1%) developed depression over a median follow-up period of 12.3 years. Premorbid constipation is associated with a 2.28-fold higher risk of depression. After adjusting the covariates, we found those with constipation still had a 48% higher risk of developing depression (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.48; 95% CI, 1.41-1.56) than those without constipation. Self-reported and diagnosed constipation were both associated with a higher risk of depression, with the aHR being 1.42 (95% CI: 1.34-1.51) and 1.66 (95% CI: 1.51-1.82), respectively. Participants with constipation were more likely to report depressive symptoms than people without (adjusted odds ratio 2.18; 95% CI, 1.97-2.43). These findings remained consistent in sensitivity analyses. Diagnosed and self-reported constipation are both prospectively associated with an elevated risk of depression. These explorative findings suggest that constipation may be an independent risk factor or a prodromal symptom of depression. Gastroenterologists and primary care physicians should pay more attention to the depressive symptoms of their constipation patients.

UK Biobank,36811473,Phenome-wide association study of genetically predicted B vitamins and homocysteine biomarkers with multiple health and disease outcomes: analysis of the UK Biobank.,"Although a number of health outcomes such as CVDs, metabolic-related outcomes, neurological disorders, pregnancy outcomes, and cancers have been identified in relation to B vitamins, evidence is of uneven quality and volume, and there is uncertainty about putative causal relationships. To explore the effects of B vitamins and homocysteine on a wide range of health outcomes based on a large biorepository linking biological samples and electronic medical records. First, we performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to investigate the associations of genetically predicted plasma concentrations (genetic component of the circulating concentrations) of folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and their metabolite homocysteine with a wide range of disease outcomes (including both prevalent and incident events) among 385,917 individuals in the UK Biobank. Second, 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to replicate any observed associations and detect causality. We considered MR P <0.05 as significant for replication. Third, dose-response, mediation, and bioinformatics analyses were carried out to examine any nonlinear trends and to disentangle the underlying mediating biological mechanisms for the identified associations. In total, 1117 phenotypes were tested in each PheWAS analysis. After multiple corrections, 32 phenotypic associations of B vitamins and homocysteine were identified. Two-sample MR analysis supported that 3 of them were causal, including associations of higher plasma vitamin B6 with lower risk of calculus of kidney (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.97; P = 0.033), higher homocysteine concentration with higher risk of hypercholesterolemia (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.56; P = 0.018), and chronic kidney disease (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.63; P = 0.012). Significant nonlinear dose-response relationships were observed for the associations of folate with anemia, vitamin B12 with vitamin B-complex deficiencies, anemia and cholelithiasis, and homocysteine with cerebrovascular disease. This study provides strong evidence for the associations of B vitamins and homocysteine with endocrine/metabolic and genitourinary disorders.","Wang, Lijuan; Li, Xue; Montazeri, Azita; MacFarlane, Amanda J; Momoli, Franco; Duthie, Susan; Senekal, Marjanne; Eguiagaray, Ines Mesa; Munger, Ron; Bennett, Derrick; Campbell, Harry; Rubini, Michele; McNulty, Helene; Little, Julian; Theodoratou, Evropi",The American journal of clinical nutrition,2023,Pregnancy; Female; Humans; Vitamin B Complex; Biological Specimen Banks; Folic Acid; Vitamin B 12; Vitamin B 6; Biomarkers; Vitamin A; Vitamin K; United Kingdom; Homocysteine; Mendelian Randomization Analysis,B vitamins; Mendelian randomization; homocysteine; phenome-wide association study,"School of Public Health and the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China; Centre for Global Health, Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; School of Public Health and the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.; School of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; Nutrition Research Division, Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; School of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; School of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, United Kingdom.; Department of Human Biology, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.; Centre for Global Health, Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Department of Nutrition and Food Sciences and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA.; Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Centre for Global Health, Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Department of Neuroscience and rehabilitation, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.; Nutrition Innovation Centre for Food and Health, Ulster University, Coleraine, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom.; School of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.; Centre for Global Health, Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, The University of Edinburgh MRC Institute of Genetics and Cancer, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.

UK Biobank,38849421,MSGene: a multistate model using genetic risk and the electronic health record applied to lifetime risk of coronary artery disease.,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death among adults worldwide. Accurate risk stratification can support optimal lifetime prevention. Current methods lack the ability to incorporate new information throughout the life course or to combine innate genetic risk factors with acquired lifetime risk. We designed a general multistate model (MSGene) to estimate age-specific transitions across 10 cardiometabolic states, dependent on clinical covariates and a CAD polygenic risk score. This model is designed to handle longitudinal data over the lifetime to address this unmet need and support clinical decision-making. We analyze longitudinal data from 480,638 UK Biobank participants and compared predicted lifetime risk with the 30-year Framingham risk score. MSGene improves discrimination (C-index 0.71 vs 0.66), age of high-risk detection (C-index 0.73 vs 0.52), and overall prediction (RMSE 1.1% vs 10.9%), in held-out data. We also use MSGene to refine estimates of lifetime absolute risk reduction from statin initiation. Our findings underscore our multistate model's potential public health value for accurate lifetime CAD risk estimation using clinical factors and increasingly available genetics toward earlier more effective prevention.","Urbut, Sarah M; Yeung, Ming Wai; Khurshid, Shaan; Cho, So Mi Jemma; Schuermans, Art; German, Jakob; Taraszka, Kodi; Paruchuri, Kaavya; Fahed, Akl C; Ellinor, Patrick T; Trinquart, Ludovic; Parmigiani, Giovanni; Gusev, Alexander; Natarajan, Pradeep",Nature communications,2024,Humans; Coronary Artery Disease; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Electronic Health Records; Aged; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Adult; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; United Kingdom; Longitudinal Studies; Multifactorial Inheritance,,"Cardiology Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Cardiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Demoulas Center for Cardiac Arrhythmias, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Integrative Research Center for Cerebrovascular and Cardiovascular Diseases, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Faculty of Medicine, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Division of Population Sciences, Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.; Cardiology Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Cardiology Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Cardiology Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Demoulas Center for Cardiac Arrhythmias, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS), Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.; Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI), Tufts University, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Data Science, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

UK Biobank,35149155,Photoreceptor Layer Thinning Is an Early Biomarker for Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Epidemiologic and Genetic Evidence from UK Biobank OCT Data.,"Despite widespread use of OCT, an early-stage imaging biomarker for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has not been identified. Pathophysiologically, the timing of drusen accumulation in relationship to photoreceptor degeneration in AMD remains unclear, as are the inherited genetic variants contributing to these processes. Herein, we jointly analyzed OCT, electronic health record data, and genomic data to characterize the time sequence of changes in retinal layer thicknesses in AMD, as well as epidemiologic and genetic associations between retinal layer thicknesses and AMD. Cohort study. Forty-four thousand eight hundred twenty-three individuals from the UK Biobank (enrollment age range, 40-70 years; 54% women; median follow-up, 10 years). The Topcon Advanced Boundary Segmentation algorithm was used for retinal layer segmentation. We associated 9 retinal layer thicknesses with prevalent AMD (present at enrollment) in a logistic regression model and with incident AMD (diagnosed after enrollment) in a Cox proportional hazards model. Next, we associated AMD-associated genetic alleles, individually and as a polygenic risk score (PRS), with retinal layer thicknesses. All analyses were adjusted for age, age-squared (age Prevalent and incident AMD. Photoreceptor segment (PS) thinning was observed throughout the lifespan of individuals analyzed, whereas retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Bruch's membrane (BM) complex thickening started after 57 years of age. Each standard deviation (SD) of PS thinning and RPE-BM complex thickening was associated with incident AMD (PS: hazard ratio [HR], 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.47; P = 3.7 × 10 Epidemiologically, PS thinning precedes RPE-BM complex thickening by decades and is the retinal layer most strongly predictive of future AMD risk. Genetically, AMD risk variants are associated with decreased PS thickness. Overall, these findings support PS thinning as an early-stage biomarker for future AMD development.","Zekavat, Seyedeh Maryam; Sekimitsu, Sayuri; Ye, Yixuan; Raghu, Vineet; Zhao, Hongyu; Elze, Tobias; Segrè, Ayellet V; Wiggs, Janey L; Natarajan, Pradeep; Del Priore, Lucian; Zebardast, Nazlee; Wang, Jay C",Ophthalmology,2022,"Adult; Aged; Biological Specimen Banks; Biomarkers; Cohort Studies; Female; High-Temperature Requirement A Serine Peptidase 1; Humans; Macular Degeneration; Male; Middle Aged; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; Tomography, Optical Coherence; United Kingdom",Age-related macular degeneration; Epidemiology; Genetics; OCT; Photoreceptor thinning,"Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut; Computational Biology & Bioinformatics Program, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut; Program in Medical and Population Genetics and Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; Computational Biology & Bioinformatics Program, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics and Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts; Cardiovascular Imaging Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Computational Biology & Bioinformatics Program, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut; School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics and Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut; Northern California Retina Vitreous Associates, Mountain View, California.

UK Biobank,40133288,Leveraging large-scale biobank EHRs to enhance pharmacogenetics of cardiometabolic disease medications.,"Electronic health records (EHRs) coupled with large-scale biobanks offer great promises to unravel the genetic underpinnings of treatment efficacy. However, medication-induced biomarker trajectories stemming from such records remain poorly studied. Here, we extract clinical and medication prescription data from EHRs and conduct GWAS and rare variant burden tests in the UK Biobank (discovery) and the All of Us program (replication) on ten cardiometabolic drug response outcomes including lipid response to statins, HbA1c response to metformin and blood pressure response to antihypertensives (N = 932-28,880). Our discovery analyses in participants of European ancestry recover previously reported pharmacogenetic signals at genome-wide significance level (APOE, LPA and SLCO1B1) and a novel rare variant association in GIMAP5 with HbA1c response to metformin. Importantly, these associations are treatment-specific and not associated with biomarker progression in medication-naive individuals. We also found polygenic risk scores to predict drug response, though they explained less than 2% of the variance. In summary, we present an EHR-based framework to study the genetics of drug response and systematically investigated the common and rare pharmacogenetic contribution to cardiometabolic drug response phenotypes in 41,732 UK Biobank and 14,277 All of Us participants.","Sadler, Marie C; Apostolov, Alexander; Cevallos, Caterina; Auwerx, Chiara; Ribeiro, Diogo M; Altman, Russ B; Kutalik, Zoltán",Nature communications,2025,"Humans; Electronic Health Records; Biological Specimen Banks; Genome-Wide Association Study; Pharmacogenetics; Male; Female; Cardiovascular Diseases; Middle Aged; Metformin; United Kingdom; Aged; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Glycated Hemoglobin; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Antihypertensive Agents",,"University Center for Primary Care and Public Health, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Computational Biology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Computational Biology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; University Center for Primary Care and Public Health, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Computational Biology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Computational Biology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.; University Center for Primary Care and Public Health, Lausanne, Switzerland. zoltan.kutalik@unil.ch.; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland. zoltan.kutalik@unil.ch.; Department of Computational Biology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland. zoltan.kutalik@unil.ch.",10.1038/s41467-025-58152-3
UK Biobank,40275681,Walking Speed and Risk of Cancer in Two Prospective Cohort Studies.,"Walking speed is a reliable marker of sarcopenia and a strong predictor of mortality, but its relationship with cancer incidence remains largely unexplored. We aimed to investigate the association between walking speed and the risk of any cancer and five common cancers, including lung, breast, colorectum, prostate, and stomach, and to explore potential mediation by biomarkers of inflammation, and lipid and glucose metabolism. The primary analysis was conducted in 431 598 participants from the UK Biobank (mean age 56.3 [SD 8.1] years at baseline), and the generalizability of findings was further tested in 1311 participants from the Hong Kong Osteoporosis Study (HKOS; mean age 57.8 [SD 11.9] years). Walking speed was self-reported in the UK Biobank and measured using a timed 6-m walk test in the HKOS. Incident cancer cases were identified from electronic health records. We used Cox models, adjusted for age, sex, height, body mass index, socioeconomic, lifestyle factors, family history of cancer, and grip strength, to estimate the association between walking speed and cancer incidence. Single and multiple mediator models were performed in the UK Biobank to examine the mediating effects of C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and glucose levels. Over a median follow-up of 10.9 and 6.9 years, 11.7% and 5.0% of the UK Biobank and HKOS participants were diagnosed with cancer, respectively. In the UK Biobank, those reported a brisk vs. slow walking pace had a 13% lower risk of any cancer (95% CI 0.84-0.90). Similarly, HKOS participants with a faster walking speed (≥ 1.0 vs. < 1.0 m/s) had a 45% reduced risk of any cancer (95% CI 0.31-0.98). In the UK Biobank, brisk walking pace was associated with a significantly decreased risk of lung cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 0.47, 95% CI 0.42-0.53) and a slightly increased risk of prostate cancer (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21). CRP, WBC count, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol significantly mediated the association between brisk walking pace and any cancer, with proportions of mediation being 6.4% (95% CI 4.4-8.7%), 11.4% (8.4-17.1%), 9.3% (7.1-12.9%), and 8.3% (6.1-11.9%), respectively. The combined mediated proportion of all five potential mediators was 25.9% (19.5-37.2%). Faster walking speed, whether self-reported or measured, is associated with a reduced risk of cancer development. This association appears to be partially mediated by lower inflammation and improved lipid profiles.","Mak, Jonathan K L; Tan, Kathryn Choon Beng; Jylhävä, Juulia; Hägg, Sara; Cheung, Ching-Lung","Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle",2025,Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Walking Speed; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Aged; Incidence; United Kingdom,cancer; cohort study; gait speed; physical activity; sarcopenia,"Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR, China.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR, China.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology and Gerontology Research Center (GEREC), Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.; Tampere Institute for Advanced Study, Tampere, Finland.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR, China.; Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research, Hebrew SeniorLife, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science Park, Pak Shek Kok, Hong Kong, SAR, China.",10.1002/jcsm.13792
UK Biobank,38095106,Prediction of Venous Thromboembolism in Diverse Populations Using Machine Learning and Structured Electronic Health Records.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current risk assessment tools, such as the Caprini and Padua scores and Wells criteria, have limitations in their applicability and accuracy. This study aimed to develop machine learning models using structured electronic health record data to predict diagnosis and 1-year risk of VTE. We trained and validated models on data from 159 001 participants in the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse. We then externally tested them on 401 723 participants in the UK Biobank and 123 039 participants in All of Us. All data sets contain populations of diverse ancestries and clinical histories. We used these data sets to develop small, medium, and large models with increasing features on a range of optimizing portability to maximizing performance. We make trained models publicly available in click-and-run format at https://doi.org/10.17632/tkwzysr4y6.6. In the holdout and external test sets, respectively, models achieved areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 to 0.83 and 0.72 to 0.82 for VTE diagnosis prediction and 0.76 to 0.78 and 0.64 to 0.69 for 1-year risk prediction, significantly outperforming the Padua score. Models also demonstrated robust performance across different VTE types and patient subsets, including ethnicity, age, and surgical and hospitalization status. Models identified both established and novel clinical features contributing to VTE risk, offering valuable insights into its underlying pathophysiology. Machine learning models using structured electronic health record data can significantly improve VTE diagnosis and 1-year risk prediction in diverse populations. Model probability scores exist on a continuum, affecting mortality risk in both healthy individuals and VTE cases. Integrating these models into electronic health record systems to generate real-time predictions may enhance VTE risk assessment, early detection, and preventative measures, ultimately reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with VTE.","Chen, Robert; Petrazzini, Ben Omega; Malick, Waqas A; Rosenson, Robert S; Do, Ron","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2024,Humans; Electronic Health Records; Risk Factors; Venous Thromboembolism; Population Health; Risk Assessment; Machine Learning; Retrospective Studies,machine learning; medical records; morbidity; risk assessment; thrombosis,"Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine (R.C., B.O.P., R.D.), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.; Medical Scientist Training Program (R.C.), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences (R.C., B.O.P., R.D.), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.; Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine (R.C., B.O.P., R.D.), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences (R.C., B.O.P., R.D.), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.; Center for Genomic Data Analytics (B.O.P., R.D.), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.; The Zena and Michael A.

UK Biobank,36104282,Association of Combined Healthy Lifestyle Factors With Incident Dementia in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes and lifestyle factors have been associated with dementia risk, but the effect of a healthy lifestyle on diabetes-related dementia remains largely unknown. We aimed to investigate whether the increased risk of dementia among individuals with diabetes can be offset by a broad combination of healthy lifestyle factors. This prospective study used data from the UK Biobank cohort. An overall lifestyle score ranging from 0 to 7 was created, with 1 point for each of the 7 healthy lifestyle factors: no current smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, regular physical activity, healthy diet, adequate sleep duration, less sedentary behavior, and frequent social contact. Incident dementia was ascertained using linkage with electronic health records. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations between diabetes, healthy lifestyle score, and dementia incidence. We included 167,946 participants aged 60 years or older without dementia at baseline (mean age 64.1 [SD 2.8] years, 51.7% female). During a median follow-up of 12.3 years, 4,351 developed all-cause dementia. Participants with diabetes, but not those with prediabetes, showed a higher risk of dementia than those with normoglycemia. Compared with diabetes-free participants who had a lifestyle score of 7, the hazard ratios (HRs) for dementia were 4.01 (95% CI 3.06-5.25) and 1.74 (95% CI 1.11-2.72) for those with diabetes who had a lifestyle score of 0-2 and 7, respectively. Among participants with diabetes, the HR for dementia comparing a lifestyle score of 7 vs 0-2 was 0.46 (95% CI 0.28-0.75). This finding corresponded to a reduction in the 10-year absolute risk of dementia from 5.22% (95% CI 3.94%-6.73%) to 1.72% (95% CI 0.92%-2.97%). The association between higher lifestyle score and lower dementia risk was independent of glycemic control and diabetes medication. Adherence to a broad range of healthy lifestyle factors was associated with a significantly lower risk of dementia among participants with diabetes. Behavioral lifestyle modification through multifactorial approaches should be a priority for prevention and delayed onset of dementia in patients with diabetes.","Wang, Bin; Wang, Ningjian; Sun, Ying; Tan, Xiao; Zhang, Jihui; Lu, Yingli",Neurology,2022,"Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Male; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Healthy Lifestyle; Incidence; Dementia",,"From the Institute and Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism (B.W., Y.S., N.W., Y.L.), Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China; Department of Neuroscience (X.T.), Uppsala University, Sweden; Department of Clinical Neuroscience (X.T.), Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; and Guangdong Mental Health Center (J.Z.), Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.; From the Institute and Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism (B.W., Y.S., N.W., Y.L.), Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China; Department of Neuroscience (X.T.), Uppsala University, Sweden; Department of Clinical Neuroscience (X.T.), Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; and Guangdong Mental Health Center (J.Z.), Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.; From the Institute and Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism (B.W., Y.S., N.W., Y.L.), Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China; Department of Neuroscience (X.T.), Uppsala University, Sweden; Department of Clinical Neuroscience (X.T.), Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; and Guangdong Mental Health Center (J.Z.), Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.; From the Institute and Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism (B.W., Y.S., N.W., Y.L.), Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China; Department of Neuroscience (X.T.), Uppsala University, Sweden; Department of Clinical Neuroscience (X.T.), Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; and Guangdong Mental Health Center (J.Z.), Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.; From the Institute and Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism (B.W., Y.S., N.W., Y.L.), Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China; Department of Neuroscience (X.T.), Uppsala University, Sweden; Department of Clinical Neuroscience (X.T.), Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; and Guangdong Mental Health Center (J.Z.), Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.; From the Institute and Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism (B.W., Y.S., N.W., Y.L.), Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China; Department of Neuroscience (X.T.), Uppsala University, Sweden; Department of Clinical Neuroscience (X.T.), Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; and Guangdong Mental Health Center (J.Z.), Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China. luyingli2008@126.com.",10.1212/WNL.0000000000201231
UK Biobank,40181791,Genetic and Lifestyle Risks for Coronary Artery Disease and Long-Term Risk of Incident Dementia Subtypes.,"Shared genetic and lifestyle risk factors may underlie the development of both coronary artery disease (CAD) and dementia. We examined whether an increased genetic risk for CAD is associated with long-term risk of developing all-cause, Alzheimer's, or vascular dementia, and investigated whether differences in potentially modifiable lifestyle factors in the mid- to late-life period may attenuate this risk. A prospective cohort study of 365 782 participants free from dementia for at least 5 years after baseline assessment was conducted within the UK Biobank cohort. Genetic risk was assessed using a genomewide polygenic risk score (PRS) for CAD and lifestyle risk using a modified version of the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 Lifestyle Risk Score (LRS). Higher values for both scores were deemed to represent increased risk. Primary outcomes were incident all-cause, Alzheimer's, and vascular dementia diagnoses obtained from self-report and electronic health records. Secondary outcomes were neuroimaging phenotypes measured in 32 028 participants recalled for magnetic resonance imaging. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the extent by which biological and behavioral risk factors contributed to observed associations. A total of 8870 cases of all-cause dementia were observed over a median 13.9-year follow-up. Both genetic (PRS) and lifestyle (LRS) risk scores for CAD were associated with a modestly elevated risk of all-cause dementia (subhazard ratio per SD increase, 1.10 [1.08, 1.12],  Individuals who are genetically predisposed to developing CAD also face an increased risk of developing dementia in old age. This risk is reduced in those demonstrating healthy lifestyle profiles earlier in the lifespan, particularly in those who may be at an increased risk of developing dementia caused by an underlying vascular pathology.","Sittichokkananon, Arisa; Garfield, Victoria; Chiesa, Scott T",Circulation,2025,"Humans; Coronary Artery Disease; Male; Female; Aged; Life Style; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Dementia; Prospective Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Incidence; Dementia, Vascular","Alzheimer’s disease; dementia; dementia, vascular; heart disease risk factors","Princess Srisavangavadhana College of Medicine, Chulabhorn Royal Academy, Bangkok, Thailand (A.S.).; Department of Population Science and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, UCL, London, UK (A.S., S.T.C.).; Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, Institute of Systems, Molecular, & Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, UK (V.G.).; Department of Population Science and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, UCL, London, UK (A.S., S.T.C.).",10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.070632

UK Biobank,38263490,Comparison of phenomic profiles in the All of Us Research Program against the US general population and the UK Biobank.,"Knowledge gained from cohort studies has dramatically advanced both public and precision health. The All of Us Research Program seeks to enroll 1 million diverse participants who share multiple sources of data, providing unique opportunities for research. It is important to understand the phenomic profiles of its participants to conduct research in this cohort. More than 280 000 participants have shared their electronic health records (EHRs) in the All of Us Research Program. We aim to understand the phenomic profiles of this cohort through comparisons with those in the US general population and a well-established nation-wide cohort, UK Biobank, and to test whether association results of selected commonly studied diseases in the All of Us cohort were comparable to those in UK Biobank. We included participants with EHRs in All of Us and participants with health records from UK Biobank. The estimates of prevalence of diseases in the US general population were obtained from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) study. We conducted phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) of 9 commonly studied diseases in both cohorts. This study included 287 012 participants from the All of Us EHR cohort and 502 477 participants from the UK Biobank. A total of 314 diseases curated by the GBD were evaluated in All of Us, 80.9% (N = 254) of which were more common in All of Us than in the US general population [prevalence ratio (PR) >1.1, P < 2 × 10-5]. Among 2515 diseases and phenotypes evaluated in both All of Us and UK Biobank, 85.6% (N = 2152) were more common in All of Us (PR >1.1, P < 2 × 10-5). The Pearson correlation coefficients of effect sizes from PheWAS between All of Us and UK Biobank were 0.61, 0.50, 0.60, 0.57, 0.40, 0.53, 0.46, 0.47, and 0.24 for ischemic heart diseases, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, colorectal cancer, lower back pain, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and cystic fibrosis, respectively. Despite the differences in prevalence of diseases in All of Us compared to the US general population or the UK Biobank, our study supports that All of Us can facilitate rapid investigation of a broad range of diseases. Most diseases were more common in All of Us than in the general US population or the UK Biobank. Results of disease-disease association tests from All of Us are comparable to those estimated in another well-studied national cohort.","Zeng, Chenjie; Schlueter, David J; Tran, Tam C; Babbar, Anav; Cassini, Thomas; Bastarache, Lisa A; Denny, Josh C",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Humans; Phenomics; Biological Specimen Banks; UK Biobank; Population Health; Phenotype; United Kingdom,All of Us Research Program; Electronic Health Records; UK Biobank; cohort; phenome-wide association studies; prevalence,"National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.; Department of Health and Society, University of Toronto, Scarborough, Toronto, ON, Canada.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, United States.; Center for Precision Medicine, Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.",10.1093/jamia/ocad260

UK Biobank,39511865,Assessing polyomic risk to predict Alzheimer's disease using a machine learning model.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Given that AD neuropathology begins decades before symptoms, there is a dire need for effective screening tools for early detection of AD to facilitate early intervention. Here, we used tree-based and deep learning methods to train polyomic prediction models for AD affection status and age at onset, employing genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and drug use data from UK Biobank. We used SHAP to determine the feature's importance. Our best-performing polyomic model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.87. We identified GFAP and CXCL17 proteins to be the strongest predictors of AD, besides apolipoprotein E (APOE) alleles. Increasing the number of cases by including ""AD-by-proxy"" cases did not improve AD prediction. Among the four modalities, genomics, and proteomics were the most informative modality based on AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Our data suggest that two blood-based biomarkers (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] and CXCL17) may be effective for early presymptomatic prediction of AD. We developed a polyomic model to predict AD and age-at-onset using omics and medication use data from EHR. We identified GFAP and CXCL17 proteins to be the strongest predictors of AD, besides APOE alleles. ""AD-by-proxy"" cases, if used in training, do not improve AD prediction.

We aimed to assess the epidemiology of people admitted to hospital with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), including the period covering the COVID-19 pandemic, which was previously not well characterised. In this retrospective, cohort study, we used whole-population electronic health records with 57 million individuals in England to identify patients hospitalised with heart failure as the primary diagnosis in any consultant episode of an in-patient admission to a National Health Service (NHS) hospital. We excluded individuals with less than 1 year of medical history records in primary or secondary care; admissions to NHS hospitals for which less than 10% of heart failure cases were linkable to the National Heart Failure Audit (NHFA); individuals younger than 18 years at the time of the heart failure hospitalisation; and patients who died in hospital during the index heart failure admission. For patients with new onset heart failure, we assessed incidence rates of 30-day and 1-year all-cause and cause-specific (cardiovascular, non-cardiovascular, and heart failure-related) emergency rehospitalisation and mortality after discharge, and dispensed guideline-recommended medical therapy (GRMT). Follow-up occurred from the index admission to the earliest occurrence of the event of interest, death, or end of data coverage. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) to compare HFrEF with HFpEF. We computed population-attributable fractions to quantify the percentage of outcomes attributable to coexisting chronic medical conditions. Among 233 320 patients identified who survived the index heart failure admission across 335 NHS hospitals between Jan 1, 2019, and Dec 31, 2022, 101 320 (43·4%) had HFrEF, 71 910 (30·8%) had HFpEF, and 60 090 (25·8%) had an unknown classification. In patients with new onset heart failure, there were reductions in all-cause 30-day (-5·2% [95% CI -7·7 to -2·6] in 2019-22) and 1-year rehospitalisation rates (-3·9% [-6·6 to -1·2]). Declining 30-day rehospitalisation rates affected patients with HFpEF (-4·8% [-9·2 to -0·2]) and HFrEF (-6·2% [-10·5 to -1·6]), although 1-year rates were not statistically significant for patients with HFpEF (-2·2% [-6·6 to 2·3] vs -5·7% [-10·6 to -0·5] for HFrEF). There were no temporal trends in incidence rates of 30-day or 1-year mortality after discharge. The rates of all-cause (HR 1·20 [1·18-1·22]) and cause-specific rehospitalisation were uniformly higher in those with HFpEF than those with HFrEF. Patients with HFpEF also had higher rates of 1-year all-cause mortality after discharge (HR 1·07 [1·05-1·09]), driven by excess risk of non-cardiovascular death (HR 1·25 [1·21-1·29]). Rates of rehospitalisation and mortality were highest in patients with coexisting chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, and liver disease. Chronic kidney disease contributed to 6·5% (5·6-7·4) of rehospitalisations within 1 year for HFrEF and 5·0% (4·1-5·9) of rehospitalisations for HFpEF, double that of any other coexisting condition. There was swift implementation of newer GRMT, but markedly lower dispensing of these medications in patients with coexisting chronic kidney disease. Rates of rehospitalisation in patients with heart failure in England have decreased during 2019-22. Further population health improvements could be reached through enhanced implementation of GRMT, particularly in patients with coexisting chronic kidney disease, who, despite being at high risk, remain undertreated.

UK Biobank,38735577,"Neuroticism personality, social contact, and dementia risk: A prospective cohort study.","Personality traits, especially neuroticism, can influence susceptibility to dementia. Social contact mitigates stress and risk of dementia, the extent to which social contact can mitigate excess risk associated with neuroticism remains unclear. We aim to investigate whether active social contact is associated with lower neuroticism-associated excess risk of dementia. This prospective cohort study examined 393,939 UK Biobank participants (mean [SD] age: 56.4 [8.1] years; 53.7 % female) assessed from 2006 to 2010 and followed up until December 2022. Neuroticism was measured using the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. Social contact levels were assessed based on household size, contact with family or friends, and group participation. Dementia was determined using linked electronic health records. High neuroticism was associated with increased all-cause dementia risk and cause-specific dementia. Among high neuroticism participants, excess risk of all-cause dementia showed a stepwise decrease with increasing social contact (low: hazard ratios (HR) = 1.27, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.15-1.40; intermediate: HR = 1.20, 95 % CI = 1.12-1.28; high: HR = 1.07, 95 % CI = 1.00-1.15). High social contact similarly decreased excess risk of cause-specific dementia, comparable to those with low neuroticism. Neuroticism and social contact information relied on self-report questionnaires at baseline, with a potential temporal relationship between these factors. Active social contact is associated with a stepwise reduction in excess dementia risk and potentially eliminate excess risk of dementia with high neuroticism individuals, supporting social contact as a preventive strategy to attenuate excess risks of dementia from neuroticism personality trait.","Liu, Yufei; Chang, Jie; Zhao, Yiwei; Tang, Yi",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Humans; Female; Dementia; Male; Neuroticism; Prospective Studies; Middle Aged; Aged; Risk Factors; Social Interaction; United Kingdom; Adult,Dementia; Excess risk; Neuroticism; Personality; Social contact; UK biobank,"Department of Neurology & Innovation Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; National Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; National Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Department of Neurology & Innovation Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; National Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.; Department of Neurology & Innovation Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; National Center for Neurological Disorders, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Neurodegenerative Laboratory of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, Beijing, China.

UK Biobank,35940884,Association between vitamin D and incident herpes zoster: a UK Biobank study.,"Vitamin D has immunomodulatory effects, but any association with herpes zoster (HZ) is unclear. To explore the association between vitamin D status and risk of incident HZ in adults in the UK. A cohort study involving participants of UK Biobank (a database containing the health information from half a million individuals) across England, Wales, and Scotland, who had at least one vitamin D testing result with linked primary care electronic health records. The primary exposure was vitamin D status, categorised as deficient (<25 nmol/L), insufficient (25-49 nmol/L), or sufficient (≥50 nmol/L). The secondary exposures were self-reported vitamin D supplementation at baseline assessment and vitamin D prescription records. The outcome was diagnosed incident HZ, identified from linked primary care or hospital inpatient records. Weibull regression was used, adjusting for potential confounders, including demographic factors, comorbidities, and immunosuppression. In total, 177 572 eligible participants were included in the analysis, with a mean follow-up time of 10.1 years (standard deviation 1.9 years). No evidence showed that low vitamin D was associated with a higher incidence of HZ, compared with people with sufficient vitamin D (deficient: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.90 to 1.10; insufficient: HR 1.03, 95% CI = 0.96 to 1.10). No evidence was found that supplementing vitamin D or receiving vitamin D prescription was associated with HZ incidence (supplementation: HR 0.88, 95% CI = 0.67 to 1.16; prescription: HR 1.11, 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.34). No association of vitamin D status, supplementation, or prescription with incident HZ was observed.

UK Biobank,35331410,Coronary Risk Estimation Based on Clinical Data in Electronic Health Records.,"Clinical features from electronic health records (EHRs) can be used to build a complementary tool to predict coronary artery disease (CAD) susceptibility. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an EHR score can improve CAD prediction and reclassification 1 year before diagnosis, beyond conventional clinical guidelines as determined by the pooled cohort equations (PCE) and a polygenic risk score for CAD. We applied a machine learning framework using clinical features from the EHR in a multiethnic, clinical care cohort (BioMe) comprising 555 CAD cases and 6,349 control subjects and in a population-based cohort (UK Biobank) comprising 3,130 CAD cases and 378,344 control subjects for external validation. Compared with the PCE, the EHR score improved CAD prediction by 12% in the BioMe Biobank and by 9% in the UK Biobank. The EHR score reclassified 25.8% and 15.2% individuals in each cohort respectively, compared with the PCE score. We observed larger improvements in the EHR score over the PCE in a subgroup of individuals with low CAD risk, with 20% increased discrimination and 34.4% increased reclassification. In all models, the polygenic risk score for CAD did not improve CAD prediction, compared with the PCE or EHR score. The EHR score resulted in increased prediction and reclassification for CAD, demonstrating its potential use for population health monitoring of short-term CAD risk in large health systems.","Petrazzini, Ben O; Chaudhary, Kumardeep; Márquez-Luna, Carla; Forrest, Iain S; Rocheleau, Ghislain; Cho, Judy; Narula, Jagat; Nadkarni, Girish; Do, Ron",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2022,Cohort Studies; Coronary Artery Disease; Electronic Health Records; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors,biobank; coronary artery disease; electronic health record; machine learning; polygenic risk score; pooled cohort equations; prevention,"The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.

UK Biobank,38789140,Multi-cancer risk stratification based on national health data: a retrospective modelling and validation study.,"Health care is experiencing a drive towards digitisation, and many countries are implementing national health data resources. Although a range of cancer risk models exists, the utility on a population level for risk stratification across cancer types has not been fully explored. We aimed to close this gap by evaluating pan-cancer risk models built on electronic health records across the Danish population with validation in the UK Biobank. In this retrospective modelling and validation study, data for model development and internal validation were derived from the following Danish health registries: the Central Person Registry, the Danish National Patient Registry, the death registry, the cancer registry, and full-text medical records from secondary care records in the capital region. The development data included adults aged 16-86 years without previous malignant cancers in the time period from Jan 1, 1995, to Dec 31, 2014. The internal validation period was from Jan 1, 2015, to April 10, 2018, and the data included all adults without a previous indication of cancer aged 16-75 years on Dec 31, 2014. The external validation cohort from the UK Biobank included all adults without a previous indication of cancer aged 50-75 years. We used time-dependent Bayesian Cox hazard models built on the combined medical history of Danish individuals. A set of 1392 covariates from available clinical disease trajectories, text-mined basic health factors, and family histories were used to train predictive models of 20 major cancer types. The models were validated on cancer incidence between 2015 and 2018 across Denmark and on individuals in the UK Biobank. The primary outcomes were discrimination and calibration performance. From the Danish registries, we included 6 732 553 individuals covering 60 million hospital visits, 90 million diagnoses, and a total of 193 million life-years between Jan 1, 1978, and April 10, 2018. Danish registry data covering the period from Jan 1, 2015, to April 10, 2018, were used to internally validate risk models, containing a total of 4 248 491 individuals who remained at risk of a primary malignant cancer diagnosis and 67 401 cancer cases recorded. For the external validation, we evaluated the same time period in the UK Biobank covering 377 004 individuals with 11 486 cancer cases. The predictive performance of the models on Danish data showed good discrimination (concordance index 0·81 [SD 0·08], ranging from 0·66 [95% CI 0·65-0·67] for cervix uteri cancer to 0·91 [0·90-0·92] for liver cancer). Performance was similar on the UK Biobank in a direct transfer when controlling for shifts in the age distribution (concordance index 0·66 [SD 0·08], ranging from 0·55 [95% CI 0·44-0·66] for cervix uteri cancer to 0·78 [0·77-0·79] for lung cancer). Cancer risks were associated, in addition to heritable components, with a broad range of preceding diagnoses and health factors. The best overall performance was seen for cancers of the digestive system (oesophageal, stomach, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic) but also thyroid, kidney, and uterine cancers. Data available in national electronic health databases can be used to approximate cancer risk factors and enable risk predictions in most cancer types. Model predictions generalise between the Danish and UK health-care systems. With the emergence of multi-cancer early detection tests, electronic health record-based risk models could supplement screening efforts.

UK Biobank,40079323,Impact of Lipoprotein(a) on Valvular and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis.,"Lp(a) (lipoprotein(a)) is an independent risk factor for calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). Whether patients with CAVS and high Lp(a) levels are at higher risk of valvular or cardiovascular events is unknown. The aim of this study is to determine whether higher Lp(a) levels are associated with valvular and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CAVS. We identified 1962 patients from the UK Biobank with an electronic health record or self-reported CAVS diagnosis but who did not previously undergo aortic valve replacement (AVR) and had a minimal follow-up time of 2.5 years. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to evaluate the effect of Lp(a) on AVR, AVR or cardiac death, and valvular or cardiovascular events (AVR, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or coronary artery bypass grafting). The maximal follow-up time was set to 5 years. During the follow-up, 198 patients underwent AVR, 260 had AVR or cardiac death, and 435 had at least 1 valvular or cardiovascular event. Patients with Lp(a) levels ≥125 versus <125 nmol/L were at higher risk of AVR (hazard ratio [HR], 1.58 [95% CI, 1.17-2.12]), AVR or cardiac death (HR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.10-1.86]), and cardiovascular or valvular events (HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.11-1.68]).

UK Biobank,33372632,"Comparative analysis, applications, and interpretation of electronic health record-based stroke phenotyping methods.","Accurate identification of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patient cohorts is essential for a wide range of clinical investigations. Automated phenotyping methods that leverage electronic health records (EHRs) represent a fundamentally new approach cohort identification without current laborious and ungeneralizable generation of phenotyping algorithms. We systematically compared and evaluated the ability of machine learning algorithms and case-control combinations to phenotype acute ischemic stroke patients using data from an EHR. Using structured patient data from the EHR at a tertiary-care hospital system, we built and evaluated machine learning models to identify patients with AIS based on 75 different case-control and classifier combinations. We then estimated the prevalence of AIS patients across the EHR. Finally, we externally validated the ability of the models to detect AIS patients without AIS diagnosis codes using the UK Biobank. Across all models, we found that the mean AUROC for detecting AIS was 0.963 ± 0.0520 and average precision score 0.790 ± 0.196 with minimal feature processing. Classifiers trained with cases with AIS diagnosis codes and controls with no cerebrovascular disease codes had the best average F1 score (0.832 ± 0.0383). In the external validation, we found that the top probabilities from a model-predicted AIS cohort were significantly enriched for AIS patients without AIS diagnosis codes (60-150 fold over expected). Our findings support machine learning algorithms as a generalizable way to accurately identify AIS patients without using process-intensive manual feature curation. When a set of AIS patients is unavailable, diagnosis codes may be used to train classifier models.","Thangaraj, Phyllis M; Kummer, Benjamin R; Lorberbaum, Tal; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Tatonetti, Nicholas P",BioData mining,2020,,Acute ischemic stroke; Electronic health record studies; Machine learning; Phenotyping algorithms,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, 622 W 168th St., PH-20, New York, NY, 10032, USA.; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mt.

UK Biobank,35793237,New Horizons: the value of UK Biobank to research on endocrine and metabolic disorders.,"UK Biobank is an intensively characterized prospective study of 500 000 men and women, aged 40 to 69 years when recruited, between 2006 and 2010, from the general population of the United Kingdom. Established as an open-access resource for researchers worldwide to perform health research that is in the public interest, UK Biobank has collected (and continues to collect) a vast amount of data on genetic, physiological, lifestyle, and environmental factors, with prolonged follow-up of heath conditions through linkage to administrative electronic health records. The study has already demonstrated its unique value in enabling research into the determinants of common endocrine and metabolic diseases. The importance of UK Biobank, heralded as a flagship project for UK health research, will only increase over time as the number of incident disease events accrue, and the study is enhanced with additional data from blood assays (such as whole-genome sequencing, metabolomics, and proteomics), wearable technologies (including physical activity and cardiac monitors), and body imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry). This unique research resource is likely to transform our understanding of the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of many endocrine and metabolic disorders.","Bešević, Jelena; Lacey, Ben; Conroy, Megan; Omiyale, Wemimo; Feng, Qi; Collins, Rory; Allen, Naomi",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2022,Biological Specimen Banks; Female; Humans; Life Style; Male; Metabolic Diseases; Prospective Studies; United Kingdom,UK Biobank; cohort; endocrinology; metabolic disorders; review,"Oxford Population Health (Nuffield Department of Population Health), University of Oxford.; Oxford Population Health (Nuffield Department of Population Health), University of Oxford.; Oxford Population Health (Nuffield Department of Population Health), University of Oxford.; Oxford Population Health (Nuffield Department of Population Health), University of Oxford.; Oxford Population Health (Nuffield Department of Population Health), University of Oxford.; Oxford Population Health (Nuffield Department of Population Health), University of Oxford.; UK Biobank, Stockport, Greater Manchester, UK.; Oxford Population Health (Nuffield Department of Population Health), University of Oxford.; UK Biobank, Stockport, Greater Manchester, UK.",10.1210/clinem/dgac407
UK Biobank,37910111,Genetic Liability to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms and Its Association With Cardiometabolic and Respiratory Outcomes.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been reported to be a risk factor for several physical and somatic symptoms. However, the genetics of PTSD and its potential association with medical outcomes remain unclear. To examine disease categories and laboratory tests from electronic health records (EHRs) that are associated with PTSD polygenic scores. This genetic association study was conducted from July 15, 2021, to January 24, 2023, using EHR data from participants across 4 biobanks. The polygenic scores of PTSD symptom severity (PGS-PTSD) were tested with all available phecodes in Vanderbilt University Medical Center's biobank (BioVU), Mass General Brigham (MGB), Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), and UK Biobank (UKBB). The significant medical outcomes were tested for overrepresented disease categories and subsequently tested for genetic correlation and 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) to determine genetically informed associations. Multivariable MR was conducted to assess whether PTSD associations with health outcomes were independent of the genetic effect of body mass index and tobacco smoking. Polygenic score of PTSD symptom severity. A total of 1680 phecodes (ie, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision- and Tenth Revision-based phenotypic definitions of health outcomes) across 4 biobanks and 490 laboratory tests across 2 biobanks (BioVU and MGB). In this study including a total of 496 317 individuals (mean [SD] age, 56.8 [8.0] years; 263 048 female [53%]) across the 4 EHR sites, meta-analyzing associations of PGS-PTSD with 1680 phecodes from 496 317 individuals showed significant associations to be overrepresented from mental health disorders (fold enrichment = 3.15; P = 5.81 × 10-6), circulatory system (fold enrichment = 3.32; P = 6.39 × 10-12), digestive (fold enrichment = 2.42; P = 2.16 × 10-7), and respiratory outcomes (fold enrichment = 2.51; P = 8.28 × 10-5). The laboratory measures scan with PGS-PTSD in BioVU and MGB biobanks revealed top associations in metabolic and immune domains. MR identified genetic liability to PTSD symptom severity as an associated risk factor for 12 health outcomes, including alcoholism (β = 0.023; P = 1.49 × 10-4), tachycardia (β = 0.045; P = 8.30 × 10-5), cardiac dysrhythmias (β = 0.016, P = 3.09 × 10-5), and acute pancreatitis (β = 0.049, P = 4.48 × 10-4). Several of these associations were robust to genetic effects of body mass index and smoking. We observed a bidirectional association between PTSD symptoms and nonspecific chest pain and C-reactive protein. Results of this study suggest the broad health repercussions associated with the genetic liability to PTSD across 4 biobanks. The circulatory and respiratory systems association was observed to be overrepresented in all 4 biobanks.","Pathak, Gita A; Singh, Kritika; Choi, Karmel W; Fang, Yu; Kouakou, Manuela R; Lee, Younga Heather; Zhou, Xiang; Fritsche, Lars G; Wendt, Frank R; Davis, Lea K; Polimanti, Renato",JAMA psychiatry,2024,"Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Acute Disease; Pancreatitis; Risk Factors; Cardiovascular Diseases; Genome-Wide Association Study",,"Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Veteran Affairs Connecticut Healthcare Center, West Haven.; Division of Genetic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit, Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Michigan Neuroscience Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Veteran Affairs Connecticut Healthcare Center, West Haven.; Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit, Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor.; Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor.; Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor.; Center for Statistical Genetics, School of Public Health, University of Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Veteran Affairs Connecticut Healthcare Center, West Haven.; Department of Anthropology, University of Toronto, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.; Biostatistics Division, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.; Division of Genetic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Veteran Affairs Connecticut Healthcare Center, West Haven.",10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2023.4127
UK Biobank,35025861,Association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations with risk of dementia among individuals with type 2 diabetes: A cohort study in the UK Biobank.,"Several epidemiological studies have suggested that vitamin D status is associated with risk of dementia in general populations. However, due to the synergistic effect between diabetic pathology and neuroinflammation, and the prothrombotic profile in patients with diabetes, whether vitamin D is associated with risk of dementia among patients with diabetes is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the associations of circulating vitamin D levels with risks of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD) among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study included 13,486 individuals (≥60 years) with T2D and free of dementia at recruitment (2006-2010) from the UK Biobank study. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations were measured using the chemiluminescent immunoassay method at recruitment. Serum 25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/L was considered sufficient, according to the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines. Incidence of all-cause dementia, AD, and VD cases was ascertained using electronic health records (EHRs). Each participant's person-years at risk were calculated from the date of recruitment to the date that dementia was reported, date of death, date of loss to follow-up, or 28 February 2018, whichever occurred first. Among the 13,486 individuals with T2D (mean age, 64.6 years; men, 64.3%), 38.3% had vitamin D ≥ 50 nmol/L and only 9.1% had vitamin D ≥ 75 nmol/L. During a mean follow-up of 8.5 years, we observed 283 cases of all-cause dementia, including 101 AD and 97 VD cases. Restricted cubic spline analysis demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between serum 25(OH)D and risk of all-cause dementia (Pnonlinearity < 0.001) and VD (Pnonlinearity = 0.007), and the nonlinear association reached borderline significance for AD (Pnonlinearity = 0.06), with a threshold at around a serum 25(OH)D value of 50 nmol/L for all the outcomes. Higher serum levels of 25(OH)D were significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia, AD, and VD. The multivariate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for participants who had serum 25(OH)D ≥ 50 nmol/L, compared with those who were severely deficient (25[OH]D < 25 nmol/L), were 0.41 (0.29-0.60) for all-cause dementia (Ptrend < 0.001), 0.50 (0.27-0.92) for AD (Ptrend = 0.06), and 0.41 (0.22-0.77) for VD (Ptrend = 0.01). The main limitation of the current analysis was the potential underreporting of dementia cases, as the cases were identified via EHRs. In this study, we observed that higher concentrations of serum 25(OH)D were significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia, AD, and VD among individuals with T2D. Our findings, if confirmed by replication, may have relevance for dementia prevention strategies that target improving or maintaining serum vitamin D concentrations among patients with T2D.","Geng, Tingting; Lu, Qi; Wan, Zhenzhen; Guo, Jingyu; Liu, Liegang; Pan, An; Liu, Gang",PLoS medicine,2022,"Adult; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Dementia; Dementia, Vascular; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; United Kingdom; Vitamin D",,"Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.",10.1371/journal.pmed.1003906

For acute myocardial infarction (AMI) the extent to which different EHR sources are accessible and accurate remains uncertain. Using MEDLINE and EMBASE we identified thirty three studies, reporting a total of 128658 patients, published between January 2000 and July 2014 that permitted assessment of the validity of AMI diagnosis drawn from EHR sources against a reference such as manual chart review. In contrast to clinical practice, only one study used EHR-derived markers of myocardial necrosis to identify possible AMI cases, none used electrocardiogram findings and one used symptoms in the form of free text combined with coded diagnosis. The remaining studies relied mostly on coded diagnosis. Thirty one studies reported positive predictive value (PPV)≥ 70% between AMI diagnosis from both secondary care and primary care EHRs and the reference. Among fifteen studies reporting EHR-derived AMI phenotypes, three cross-referenced ST-segment elevation AMI diagnosis (PPV range 71-100%), two non-ST-segment elevation AMI (PPV 91.0, 92.1%), three non-fatal AMI (PPV range 82-92.2%) and six fatal AMI (PPV range 64-91.7%). Clinical coding of EHR-derived AMI diagnosis in primary care and secondary care was found to be accurate in different clinical settings and for different phenotypes. However, markers of myocardial necrosis, ECG and symptoms, the cornerstones of a clinical diagnosis, are underutilised and remain a challenge to retrieve from EHRs.","Rubbo, Bruna; Fitzpatrick, Natalie K; Denaxas, Spiros; Daskalopoulou, Marina; Yu, Ning; Patel, Riyaz S; Hemingway, Harry",International journal of cardiology,2015,Electronic Health Records; Humans; Myocardial Infarction; Phenotype; Reproducibility of Results,Acute coronary syndrome; Clinical coding; Electronic health records; Myocardial infarction; Phenotype; Validation studies,"Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, University College London, UK.

This study aimed to investigate the associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] with HF risk among individuals with T2D, in observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) frameworks. Observational analyses were performed among 15,226 T2D participants aged 40-72 y from the UK Biobank. HF incidence was ascertained through electronic health records. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between serum 25(OH)D and HF risk among people with T2D. MR analyses were conducted among 11,260 unrelated participants with T2D. A weighted genetic risk score for genetically predicted 25(OH)D concentration was instrumented using 62 confirmed genome-wide variants. The mean ± standard deviation of serum 25(OH)D was 43.4 ± 20.4 nmol/L. During a median follow-up of 11.3 y, 836 incident HF events occurred. Serum 25(OH)D was nonlinearly and inversely associated with HF and the decreasing risk tended to plateau at around 50 nmol/L. Comparing those with 25(OH)D <25 nmol/L, the multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CI) was 0.67 (0.54, 0.83) for participants with 25(OH)D of 50.0-74.9 nmol/L and was 0.71 (0.52, 0.98) for 25(OH)D >75 nmol/L. In MR analysis, each 7% increment in genetically predicted 25(OH)D was associated with 36% lower risk of HF among people with T2D (HR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.99). Higher serum 25(OH)D was associated with lower HF risk among individuals with T2D and the MR analysis suggested a potential causal relationship.

UK Biobank,38819879,Redefining Health Care Data Interoperability: Empirical Exploration of Large Language Models in Information Exchange.,"Efficient data exchange and health care interoperability are impeded by medical records often being in nonstandardized or unstructured natural language format. Advanced language models, such as large language models (LLMs), may help overcome current challenges in information exchange. This study aims to evaluate the capability of LLMs in transforming and transferring health care data to support interoperability. Using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and UK Biobank, the study conducted 3 experiments. Experiment 1 assessed the accuracy of transforming structured laboratory results into unstructured format. Experiment 2 explored the conversion of diagnostic codes between the coding frameworks of the ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification), and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) using a traditional mapping table and a text-based approach facilitated by the LLM ChatGPT. Experiment 3 focused on extracting targeted information from unstructured records that included comprehensive clinical information (discharge notes). The text-based approach showed a high conversion accuracy in transforming laboratory results (experiment 1) and an enhanced consistency in diagnostic code conversion, particularly for frequently used diagnostic names, compared with the traditional mapping approach (experiment 2). In experiment 3, the LLM showed a positive predictive value of 87.2% in extracting generic drug names. This study highlighted the potential role of LLMs in significantly improving health care data interoperability, demonstrated by their high accuracy and efficiency in data transformation and exchange. The LLMs hold vast potential for enhancing medical data exchange without complex standardization for medical terms and data structure.","Yoon, Dukyong; Han, Changho; Kim, Dong Won; Kim, Songsoo; Bae, SungA; Ryu, Jee An; Choi, Yujin",Journal of medical Internet research,2024,Humans; Health Information Exchange; Health Information Interoperability; Electronic Health Records; Natural Language Processing; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine,data standardization; health care interoperability; large language models; medical data transformation; text-based,"Department of Biomedical Systems Informatics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Institute for Innovation in Digital Healthcare (IIDH), Severance Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Center for Digital Health, Yongin Severance Hospital, Yonsei University Health System, Yongin, Republic of Korea.; Department of Biomedical Systems Informatics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Department of Biomedical Systems Informatics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Department of Biomedical Systems Informatics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Center for Digital Health, Yongin Severance Hospital, Yonsei University Health System, Yongin, Republic of Korea.; Department of Cardiology, Yongin Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yongin, Republic of Korea.; Department of Biomedical Systems Informatics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Department of Biomedical Systems Informatics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.",10.2196/56614
UK Biobank,37634228,Association between cancer and dementia risk in the UK Biobank: evidence of diagnostic bias.,"Epidemiological studies have identified an inverse association between cancer and dementia. Underlying methodological biases have been postulated, yet no studies have systematically investigated the potential for each source of bias within a single dataset. We used the UK Biobank to compare estimates for the cancer-dementia association using different analytical specifications designed to sequentially address multiple sources of bias, including competing risk of death, selective survival, confounding bias, and diagnostic bias. We included 140,959 UK Biobank participants aged ≥ 55 without dementia before enrollment and with linked primary care data. We used cancer registry data to identify cancer cases prevalent before UK Biobank enrollment and incident cancer diagnosed after enrollment. We used Cox models to evaluate associations of prevalent and incident cancer with all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia. We used time-varying models to evaluate diagnostic bias. Over a median follow-up of 12.3 years, 3,310 dementia cases were diagnosed. All-site incident cancer was positively associated with all-cause dementia incidence (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02-1.29), but prevalent cancer was not (HR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.92-1.17). Results were similar for vascular dementia. AD was not associated with prevalent or incident cancer. Dementia diagnosis was substantially elevated in the first year after cancer diagnosis (HR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.42-2.36), after which the association attenuated to null, suggesting diagnostic bias. Following a cancer diagnosis, health care utilization or cognitive consequences of diagnosis or treatment may increase chance of receiving a dementia diagnosis, creating potential diagnostic bias in electronic health records-based studies.","Wang, Jingxuan; Buto, Peter; Ackley, Sarah F; Kobayashi, Lindsay C; Graff, Rebecca E; Zimmerman, Scott C; Hayes-Larson, Eleanor; Mayeda, Elizabeth Rose; Asiimwe, Stephen B; Calmasini, Camilla; Glymour, M Maria",European journal of epidemiology,2023,"Humans; Dementia; Dementia, Vascular; Biological Specimen Banks; UK Biobank; Alzheimer Disease; Neoplasms",Alzheimer’s disease; Dementia; Diagnostic bias; cancer,"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. maria.glymour@ucsf.edu.",10.1007/s10654-023-01036-x

This study performed a phenome-wide association study of BMI using a clinical cohort of 736,726 adults. This was followed by genetic association studies using two separate cohorts: one consisting of 65,174 adults in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network and another with 405,432 participants in the UK Biobank. Class 3 obesity was associated with 433 phenotypes, representing 59.3% of all billing codes in individuals with severe obesity. A genome-wide polygenic risk score for BMI, accounting for 7.5% of variance in BMI, was associated with 296 clinical diseases, including strong associations with type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, hypertension, and chronic liver disease. In all three cohorts, 199 phenotypes were associated with class 3 obesity and polygenic risk for obesity, including novel associations such as increased risk of renal failure, venous insufficiency, and gastroesophageal reflux. This combined genomic and phenomic systematic approach demonstrated that obesity has a strong genetic predisposition and is associated with a considerable burden of disease across all disease classes.","Robinson, Jamie R;

This study explores shared loci, and genes between PTSD and CV conditions from three major domains: CV diagnoses from electronic health records (CV-EHR), cardiac and aortic imaging, and CV health behaviors defined in Life's Essential 8 (LE8). We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PTSD (N=1,222,882), 246 CV diagnoses based on EHR data from Million Veteran Program (MVP; N=458,061), UK Biobank (UKBB; N=420,531), 82 cardiac and aortic imaging traits (N=26,893), and GWAS of traits defined in the LE8 (N = 282,271 ~ 1,320,016). Shared loci between PTSD and CV conditions were identified using local genetic correlations (rg), and colocalization (shared causal variants). Overlapping genes between PTSD and CV conditions were identified from genetically regulated proteome expression in brain and blood tissues, and subsequently tested to identify functional pathways and gene-drug targets. Epidemiological replication of EHR-CV diagnoses was performed in AllofUS cohort (AoU; N=249,906). Among the 76 PTSD-susceptibility risk loci, 33 loci exhibited local rg with 45 CV-EHR traits (|rg|≥0.4), four loci with eight heart imaging traits(|rg|≥0.5), and 44 loci with LE8 factors (|rg|≥0.36) in MVP. Among significantly correlated loci, we found shared causal variants (colocalization probability > 80%) between PTSD and 17 CV-EHR (in MVP) at 11 loci in MVP, that also replicated in UKBB and/or other cohorts. Of the 17 traits, the observational analysis in the AoU showed PTSD was associated with 13 CV-EHR traits after accounting for socioeconomic factors and depression diagnosis. PTSD colocalized with eight heart imaging traits on 2 loci and with LE8 factors on 31 loci. Leveraging blood and brain proteome expression, we found 33 and 122 genes, respectively, shared between PTSD and CVD. Blood proteome genes were related to neuronal and immune processes, while the brain proteome genes converged on metabolic and calcium-modulating pathways (FDR p <0.05). Drug repurposing analysis highlighted  PTSD-CV comorbidities exhibit shared risk loci, and genes involved in tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms.","Shen, Jie; Valentim, Wander; Friligkou, Eleni; Overstreet, Cassie; Choi, Karmel; Koller, Dora; O'Donnell, Christopher J; Stein, Murray B; Gelernter, Joel; Lv, Haitao; Sun, Ling; Falcone, Guido J; Polimanti, Renato; Pathak, Gita A",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024,,Brain; Cardiovascular Disease; GWAS; Heart; Life’s Essential 8; PTSD; electronic health records,"Department of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Veteran Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Veteran Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA.; Center for Precision Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Veteran Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Genetics, Microbiology, and Statistics, Faculty of Biology, University of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.; Department of Psychiatry, UC San Diego School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California; Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California; Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California.; Cardiology Section, Department of Medicine, Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, West Roxbury, Massachusetts.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Veteran Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.; Department of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.; Center for Brain and Mind Health Yale University New Haven CT USA; Department of Neurology Yale University New Haven CT USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Veteran Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Veteran Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA.",10.1101/2024.08.20.24312181
UK Biobank,33817817,Neuroticism and Risk of Parkinson's Disease: A Meta-Analysis.,"Neuroticism is linked to mood disorders and Alzheimer's disease, but fewer studies have tested the prospective association with Parkinson's disease (PD). To examine the association between neuroticism and risk of PD in a large cohort and a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. Participants from the UK Biobank (N = 490,755) completed a neuroticism scale in 2006-2010. Incident PD was ascertained using electronic health records or death records up to 2018. The systematic search and meta-analysis followed the MOOSE guidelines. During 11.91 years of follow-up (mean = 8.88 years; 4,360,105 person-years) 1142 incident PD cases were identified. Neuroticism was associated with higher risk of incident PD, both as continuous (HR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.21-1.36) and categorical variable (top vs. bottom quartiles: HR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.60-2.22). The association remained significant after accounting for age, sex, smoking, physical activity, anxiety, and depressed mood, and after excluding cases that occurred within the first 5 years of follow-up. The associations were similar for women and men and across levels of socioeconomic status. Random-effect meta-analysis of four prospective studies (N = 548,284) found neuroticism associated with increased risk of incident PD (HR = 1.82; 95% CI: 1.59-2.08; P = 7.31 The results from the large UK Biobank and meta-analysis of prospective studies indicate that neuroticism is consistently associated with a higher risk of incident PD. © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","Terracciano, Antonio; Aschwanden, Damaris; Stephan, Yannick; Cerasa, Antonio; Passamonti, Luca; Toschi, Nicola; Sutin, Angelina R",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2021,Alzheimer Disease; Cohort Studies; Humans; Neuroticism; Parkinson Disease; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors,Parkinson's disease; meta-analysis; neuroticism; prospective study,"Department of Geriatrics, Florida State University College of Medicine, Tallahassee, Florida, USA.; Department of Geriatrics, Florida State University College of Medicine, Tallahassee, Florida, USA.; Euromov, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.; Institute for Biomedical Research and Innovation, National Research Council (IRIB-CNR), Mangone, Italy.; S.

UK Biobank,37028711,How common is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy… really?: Disease prevalence revisited 27 years after CARDIA.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heterogeneous albeit treatable cardiac disease of variable severity, with the potential for heart failure, atrial fibrillation and arrhythmic sudden death, characterized by otherwise unexplained left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and affecting all ages and races. Over the last 30 years, several studies have estimated the prevalence of HCM in the general population, employing echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), as well electronic health records and billing databases for clinical diagnosis. The estimated prevalence in the general population based on the disease phenotype of LV hypertrophy by imaging is 1:500 (0.2%). This prevalence was initially proposed in 1995 in the population-based CARDIA study employing echocardiography, and more recently confirmed by automated CMR analysis in the large UK Biobank cohort. The 1:500 prevalence appears most relevant to clinical assessment and management of HCM. These available data suggest that HCM is not a rare condition but likely underdiagnosed clinically and by extrapolation potentially affects about 700,000 Americans and possibly 15 million people worldwide.","Massera, Daniele; Sherrid, Mark V; Maron, Martin S; Rowin, Ethan J; Maron, Barry J",International journal of cardiology,2023,"Humans; Prevalence; Fibrosis; Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; Magnetic Resonance Imaging",Epidemiology; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Prevalence,"Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Program, Leon H.

UK Biobank,40194871,"Smoking, alcohol and risk of sarcopenia: a Mendelian randomisation study.","Observational studies have found that cigarette smoking increased the prevalence and incidence of sarcopenia, whereas alcohol consumption appeared to decrease the risk. These findings, however, may be susceptible to either confounding bias or reverse causation. We conducted a Mendelian randomisation (MR) study to appraise the causal relation of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption to the risk of sarcopenia. Genetic instruments associated with cigarette smoking (cigarettes per day) and alcohol consumption (drinks per week) were retrieved from the publicly available genome-wide association data. Individual-level, electronic medical record-linked data on sarcopenia, grip strength and appendicular lean mass were obtained from the UK Biobank. We performed two-sample univariable and multivariable MR analyses to examine the relation of genetically determined cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption to the risk of sarcopenia and its indices. One SD increase of genetically determined cigarette smoking was associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia (OR=2.51, 95% CI: 1.26 to 5.01, p=0.001), decreased grip strength (β=-0.63 kg, 95% CI: -1.13 to -0.13, p=0.01) and less appendicular lean mass (β=-0.22 kg, 95% CI: -0.44 to -0.01, p=0.04). Although one SD increase of genetically determined alcohol consumption was associated with decreased grip strength (β=-1.15 kg, 95% CI: -2.09 to -0.10, p=0.02), no statistically significant causal association was observed between genetically determined alcohol consumption and either sarcopenia (OR=0.96, 95% CI: 0.35 to 2.62, p=0.94) or appendicular lean mass (β=-0.23 kg, 95% CI: -0.91 to 0.45, p=0.51).

UK Biobank,38906208,Use of Diagnostic Codes for Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Polygenic Risk Score Construction in Electronic Health Record-Linked Biobanks.,"Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) likely predict risk and prognosis of glaucoma. We compared the PRS performance for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), defined using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes vs manual medical record review. Retrospective cohort study. We identified POAG cases in the Mount Sinai BioMe and Mass General Brigham (MGB) biobanks using ICD codes. We confirmed POAG based on optical coherence tomograms and visual fields. In a separate 5% sample, the absence of POAG was confirmed with intraocular pressure and cup-disc ratio criteria. We used genotype data and either self-reported glaucoma diagnoses or ICD-10 codes for glaucoma diagnoses from the UK Biobank and the lassosum method to compute a genome-wide POAG PRS. We compared the area under the curve (AUC) for POAG prediction based on ICD codes vs medical records. We reviewed 804 of 996 BioMe and 367 of 1006 MGB ICD-identified cases. In BioMe and MGB, respectively, positive predictive value was 53% and 55%; negative predictive value was 96% and 97%; sensitivity was 97% and 97%; and specificity was 44% and 53%. Adjusted PRS AUCs for POAG using ICD codes vs manual record review in BioMe were not statistically different (P ≥.21) by ancestry: 0.77 vs 0.75 for African, 0.80 vs 0.80 for Hispanic, and 0.81 vs 0.81 for European.

UK Biobank,36227072,Transforming and evaluating the UK Biobank to the OMOP Common Data Model for COVID-19 research and beyond.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated the value of real-world data for public health research. International federated analyses are crucial for informing policy makers. Common data models (CDMs) are critical for enabling these studies to be performed efficiently. Our objective was to convert the UK Biobank, a study of 500 000 participants with rich genetic and phenotypic data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM. We converted UK Biobank data to OMOP CDM v. 5.3. We transformedparticipant research data on diseases collected at recruitment and electronic health records (EHRs) from primary care, hospitalizations, cancer registrations, and mortality from providers in England, Scotland, and Wales. We performed syntactic and semantic validations and compared comorbidities and risk factors between source and transformed data. We identified 502 505 participants (3086 with COVID-19) and transformed 690 fields (1 373 239 555 rows) to the OMOP CDM using 8 different controlled clinical terminologies and bespoke mappings. Specifically, we transformed self-reported noncancer illnesses 946 053 (83.91% of all source entries), cancers 37 802 (70.81%), medications 1 218 935 (88.25%), and prescriptions 864 788 (86.96%). In EHR, we transformed 13 028 182 (99.95%) hospital diagnoses, 6 465 399 (89.2%) procedures, 337 896 333 primary care diagnoses (CTV3, SNOMED-CT), 139 966 587 (98.74%) prescriptions (dm+d) and 77 127 (99.95%) deaths (ICD-10). We observed good concordance across demographic, risk factor, and comorbidity factors between source and transformed data. Our study demonstrated that the OMOP CDM can be successfully leveraged to harmonize complex large-scale biobanked studies combining rich multimodal phenotypic data. Our study uncovered several challenges when transforming data from questionnaires to the OMOP CDM which require further research. The transformed UK Biobank resource is a valuable tool that can enable federated research, like COVID-19 studies.","Papez, Vaclav; Moinat, Maxim; Voss, Erica A; Bazakou, Sofia; Van Winzum, Anne; Peviani, Alessia; Payralbe, Stefan; Kallfelz, Michael; Asselbergs, Folkert W; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel; Dobson, Richard J B; Denaxas, Spiros",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2022,"Humans; Databases, Factual; Biological Specimen Banks; COVID-19; Electronic Health Records; United Kingdom",OMOP; common data model; electronic health records; medical ontologies; phenotyping,"Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.; The Hyve, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Epidemiology, Janssen Research & Development LLC, Raritan, New Jersey, USA.; The Hyve, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; The Hyve, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; The Hyve, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; The Hyve, Utrecht, The Netherlands.; Odysseus Data Services GmbH, Berlin, Germany.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.; Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Department of Cardiology, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.; Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.; Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.; British Heart Foundation Data Science Center, London, UK.; UCL Hospitals, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), London, UK.",10.1093/jamia/ocac203
UK Biobank,35196515,GWAS of longitudinal trajectories at biobank scale.,"Biobanks linked to massive, longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data make numerous new genetic research questions feasible. One among these is the study of biomarker trajectories. For example, high blood pressure measurements over visits strongly predict stroke onset, and consistently high fasting glucose and Hb1Ac levels define diabetes. Recent research reveals that not only the mean level of biomarker trajectories but also their fluctuations, or within-subject (WS) variability, are risk factors for many diseases. Glycemic variation, for instance, is recently considered an important clinical metric in diabetes management. It is crucial to identify the genetic factors that shift the mean or alter the WS variability of a biomarker trajectory. Compared to traditional cross-sectional studies, trajectory analysis utilizes more data points and captures a complete picture of the impact of time-varying factors, including medication history and lifestyle. Currently, there are no efficient tools for genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of biomarker trajectories at the biobank scale, even for just mean effects. We propose TrajGWAS, a linear mixed effect model-based method for testing genetic effects that shift the mean or alter the WS variability of a biomarker trajectory. It is scalable to biobank data with 100,000 to 1,000,000 individuals and many longitudinal measurements and robust to distributional assumptions. Simulation studies corroborate that TrajGWAS controls the type I error rate and is powerful. Analysis of eleven biomarkers measured longitudinally and extracted from UK Biobank primary care data for more than 150,000 participants with 1,800,000 observations reveals loci that significantly alter the mean or WS variability.","Ko, Seyoon; German, Christopher A; Jensen, Aubrey; Shen, Judong; Wang, Anran; Mehrotra, Devan V; Sun, Yan V; Sinsheimer, Janet S; Zhou, Hua; Zhou, Jin J",American journal of human genetics,2022,Biological Specimen Banks; Biomarkers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Electronic Health Records; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Longitudinal Studies,biobank; biomarkers; disease progression; electronic medical records; longitudinal; trend; variations; within-subject variability,"Department of Computational Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA; Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.; Biostatistics and Research Decision Sciences, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ 07033, USA.; Biostatistics and Research Decision Sciences, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ 07033, USA.; Biostatistics and Research Decision Sciences, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ 07033, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.; Department of Computational Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA; Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA; Department of Human Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.; Department of Computational Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA; Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.

This study included a total of 223,951 participants from the UK Biobank. Smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, healthy diet patterns, sedentary time, and sleep duration items were used to construct the lifestyle score. Income, education, and occupation were used to assess SES. Cases of adult-onset asthma were identified on the basis of electronic health records. The Cox proportional hazards regression was used to explore the association of socioeconomic inequality and lifestyle factors with asthma. Compared with the most healthy lifestyle category, the hazard ratios (95% CIs) of the moderately healthy lifestyle and least healthy lifestyle categories for asthma were 1.08 (1.01-1.15) and 1.29 (1.20-1.39), respectively. A significant interaction (P Unhealthy lifestyle factors are associated with an increased risk of asthma in adults, and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are more negatively affected by unhealthy lifestyles.

We developed a deep learning approach combining electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform and electronic health record data to assess whether patients had pathogenic variants causing LQTS. We defined patients with high-risk genotypes as having ≥1 pathogenic variant in one of the LQTS-susceptibility genes. We trained the model using data from United Kingdom Biobank (UKBB) and then fine-tuned in a racially/ethnically diverse cohort using Mount Sinai BioMe Biobank. Following group-stratified 5-fold splitting, the fine-tuned model achieved area under the precision-recall curve of 0.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.29) and area under the receiver operating curve of 0.83 (0.82-0.83) on independent testing data from BioMe.

UK Biobank,36624143,Explainable machine learning aggregates polygenic risk scores and electronic health records for Alzheimer's disease prediction.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common late-onset neurodegenerative disorder. Identifying individuals at increased risk of developing AD is important for early intervention. Using data from the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium, we constructed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for AD and age-at-onset (AAO) of AD for the UK Biobank participants. We then built machine learning (ML) models for predicting development of AD, and explored feature importance among PRSs, conventional risk factors, and ICD-10 codes from electronic health records, a total of > 11,000 features using the UK Biobank dataset. We used eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which provided superior ML performance as well as aided ML model explanation. For participants age 40 and older, the area under the curve for AD was 0.88. For subjects of age 65 and older (late-onset AD), PRSs were the most important predictors. This is the first observation that PRSs constructed from the AD risk and AAO play more important roles than age in predicting AD. The ML model also identified important predictors from EHR, including urinary tract infection, syncope and collapse, chest pain, disorientation and hypercholesterolemia, for developing AD. Our ML model improved the accuracy of AD risk prediction by efficiently exploring numerous predictors and identified novel feature patterns.","Gao, Xiaoyi Raymond; Chiariglione, Marion; Qin, Ke; Nuytemans, Karen; Scharre, Douglas W; Li, Yi-Ju; Martin, Eden R",Scientific reports,2023,Humans; Adult; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Electronic Health Records; Risk Factors; Machine Learning,,"Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. raymond.gao@osumc.edu.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. raymond.gao@osumc.edu.; Division of Human Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. raymond.gao@osumc.edu.; Ohio State University Physicians Inc., Columbus, OH, USA. raymond.gao@osumc.edu.; Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.; Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.; John P.

UK Biobank,39911793,UK Biobank-A Unique Resource for Discovery and Translation Research on Genetics and Neurologic Disease.,"UK Biobank is a large-scale prospective study with extensive genetic and phenotypic data from half a million adults. Participants, aged 40 to 69, were recruited from the general UK population between 2006 and 2010. During recruitment, participants completed questionnaires covering lifestyle and medical history, underwent physical measurements, and provided biological samples for long-term storage. Whole-cohort assays have been conducted, including biochemical markers, genotyping, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, as well as proteomics and metabolomics in large subsets of the cohort, with potential for additional assays in the future. Participants consented to link their data to electronic health records, enabling the identification of health outcomes over time. Research studies using UK Biobank data have already enhanced our understanding of the role of genetic variation in neurologic disease, offering insights into potential therapeutic approaches. The integration of genetic and imaging data has led to significant discoveries regarding the relationship between genetic variants and brain structure and function, particularly in Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. Genetic data have also allowed Mendelian randomization analyses to be performed, enabling further investigation into the causality of associations between behavioral and physiologic factors-such as diet and blood pressure-and neurologic outcomes. Furthermore, genetic and proteomic data have been particularly useful in identifying new drug targets for neurologic disease and in enhancing risk prediction algorithms that are increasingly applied in clinical practice to identify those at higher risk. As UK Biobank continues to be enhanced, and the cases of neurologic disease accrue over time, the study will become increasingly valuable for both discovery and translational research on genetics and neurologic disease.","Taylor, Hannah; Lewins, Melissa; Foody, M George B; Gray, Oliver; Bešević, Jelena; Conroy, Megan C; Collins, Rory; Lacey, Ben; Allen, Naomi; Burkitt-Gray, Lucy",Neurology.

UK Biobank,38496631,Discover overlooked complications after preeclampsia using electronic health records.,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a severe pregnancy complication characterized by hypertension and end-organ damage such as proteinuria. PE poses a significant threat to women's long-term health, including an increased risk of cardiovascular and renal diseases. Most previous studies have been hypothesis-based, potentially overlooking certain significant complications. This study conducts a comprehensive, non-hypothesis-based analysis of PE-complicated diagnoses after pregnancies using multiple large-scale electronic health records (EHR) datasets. From the University of Michigan (UM) Healthcare System, we collected 4,348 PE patients for the cases and 27,377 patients with pregnancies not complicated by PE or related conditions for the controls. We first conducted a non-hypothesis-based analysis to identify any long-term adverse health conditions associated with PE using logistic regression with adjustments to demographics, social history, and medical history. We confirmed the identified complications with  Uncomplicated hypertension, complicated diabetes, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and obesity exhibited significantly increased risks whereas hypothyroidism showed decreased risks, in 5 consecutive years after PE in the UM discovery data.  This study addresses the lack of a comprehensive examination of PE's long-term effects utilizing large-scale EHR and advanced statistical methods. Our findings underscore the need for long-term monitoring and interventions for women with a history of PE, emphasizing the importance of personalized postpartum care. Notably, the racial disparities observed in the impact of PE on hypertension and hypothyroidism highlight the necessity of tailored aftercare based on race.","Garmire, Lana; Zhu, Haoming; Yangs, Xiaotong; Xie, Wanling; Langen, Elizabeth; Li, Ruowang",Research square,2024,,,University of Michigan.; University of Michigan.; University of Michigan.; Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.; University of Michigan.; University of Pennsylvania.,10.21203/rs.3.rs-3937688/v1

This study aimed to investigate the associations between serum 25(OH)D and CVD incidence and mortality among patients with CKD. This prospective study included 21,507 participants with CKD and free of CVD in the UK Biobank. Incidences of total and subtypes of CVD and mortality were ascertained via electronic health records. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidential intervals (CIs) for CVD incidence and mortality. The median serum 25(OH)D concentration was 44.0 nmol/L (interquartile range: 30.1, 60.6 nmol/L). After multivariable adjustment, compared with CKD patients with serum 25(OH)D concentrations of <25 nmol/L, those with serum 25(OH)D ≥75 nmol/L had HRs (95% CIs) of 0.80 (0.71, 0.90) for total CVD incidence, 0.82 (0.69, 0.97) for ischemic heart disease, 0.56 (0.41, 0.77) for stroke, 0.64 (0.46, 0.88) for myocardial infarction, 0.62 (0.49, 0.80) for heart failure, 0.60 (0.43, 0.85) for CVD mortality, and 0.62 (0.52, 0.74) for all-cause mortality. In addition, these associations were not modified by vitamin D receptor polymorphisms, with no significant interaction detected. Higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly associated with lower risks of total and subtypes of CVD incidence and mortality among individuals with CKD.

GWA analyses from both cohorts were tested for chondromalacia using a logistic regression model adjusting for sex, height, weight, age of enrollment, and race/ethnicity using allele counts for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The data from the 2 GWA studies (KPRB and UK Biobank) were combined in a meta-analysis. There were a total of 3,872 combined cases of chondromalacia from the KPRB and the UK Biobank cohorts.

UK Biobank,34213766,Utilizing Large Electronic Medical Record Data Sets to Identify Novel Drug-Gene Interactions for Commonly Used Drugs.,"Real-world prescribing of drugs differs from the experimental systems, physiological-pharmacokinetic models, and clinical trials used in drug development and licensing, with drugs often used in patients with multiple comorbidities with resultant polypharmacy. The increasing availability of large biobanks linked to electronic healthcare records enables the potential to identify novel drug-gene interactions in large populations of patients. In this study we used three Scottish cohorts and UK Biobank to identify drug-gene interactions for the 50 most commonly used drugs and 162 variants in genes involved in drug pharmacokinetics. We defined two phenotypes based upon prescribing behavior-drug-stop or dose-decrease. Using this approach, we replicate 11 known drug-gene interactions including, for example, CYP2C9/CYP2C8 variants and sulfonylurea/thiazolidinedione prescribing and ABCB1/ABCG2 variants and statin prescribing. We identify eight novel associations after Bonferroni correction, three of which are replicated or validated in the UK Biobank or have other supporting results: The C-allele at rs4918758 in CYP2C9 was associated with a 25% (15-44%) lower odds of dose reduction of quinine, P = 1.6 × 10","Malki, Mustafa Adnan; Dawed, Adem Y; Haywood, Caroline; Doney, Alex; Pearson, Ewan R",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2021,"ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C8; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6; Drug Interactions; Electronic Health Records; Genotype; Humans; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Phenotype; Polypharmacy",,"Population Health & Genomics, School of Medicine, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.; Clinical Pharmacy Department, College of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia.; Population Health & Genomics, School of Medicine, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.; Medical Research Council Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Population Health & Genomics, School of Medicine, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.; Population Health & Genomics, School of Medicine, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.",10.1002/cpt.2352
UK Biobank,38308373,"Accelerometer-measured physical activity, sedentary behavior, and risk of incident pelvic organ prolapse: a prospective cohort study in the UK Biobank.","Previous studies on physical activity (PA) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) were largely limited to self-reported PA in athletes, soldiers, and women in postpartum. We aimed to investigate the association of accelerometer-measured PA and sedentary behavior with the risk of POP in middle-aged and elderly women. In this prospective cohort derived from the UK Biobank, the intensity and duration of PA and sedentary behavior were measured with wrist-worn accelerometers over a 7-day period in 2013-2015 for 47,674 participants (aged 42.8-77.9 years) without pre-existing POP. Participants were followed up until the end of 2022, during which incident POP was ascertained mainly by the electronic health records. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines were used to assess the associations of interest. Isotemporal substitution models were applied to test the effects of substituting a type of activity with equivalent duration of others. During a median follow-up of 8.0 years, 779 cases of POP were recorded. The duration of light-intensity PA (LPA) was positively whereas sedentary time was negatively associated with the risk of POP. Every additional 1 h/day of LPA elevated the risk of POP by 18% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10%-26%). In contrast, the risk decreased by 5% (95% CI, 0-8%) per 1 h/day increment in sedentary behavior. No associations were found between moderate-intensity PA (MPA) or vigorous-intensity PA (VPA) and POP, except that women who had a history of hysterectomy were more likely to develop POP when performing more VPA (53% higher risk for every additional 15 min/day). Substituting 1 h/day of LPA with equivalent sedentary time was associated with a 18% (95% CI, 11%-24%) lower risk of POP. The risk can also be reduced by 17% (95% CI, 7%-25%) through substituting 30 min/day of LPA with MPA. More time spent in LPA or less sedentary time was linked to an elevated risk of POP in middle-aged and elderly women, while MPA or VPA was not. Substituting LPA with equivalent duration of sedentary behavior or MPA may lower the risk of POP.","Si, Keyi; Cao, Zhi; Liu, Qianqian; Yang, Yingying; Dai, Qingqiang; Yao, Yuting; Qiao, Yingying; Xu, Chenjie; Wu, Guizhu",The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,2024,Aged; Middle Aged; Humans; Female; Sedentary Behavior; Prospective Studies; UK Biobank; Biological Specimen Banks; Accelerometry; Exercise,Accelerometer; Pelvic organ prolapse; Physical activity; Sedentary behavior,"Department of Gynecology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, No.2699 West Gaoke Road, Shanghai, 201204, China.; School of Public Health, Hangzhou Normal University, No.2318 Yuhangtang Road, Yuhang District, Hangzhou, 311121, China.; School of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Gynecology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, No.2699 West Gaoke Road, Shanghai, 201204, China.; Clinical Research Center, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Gynecology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, No.2699 West Gaoke Road, Shanghai, 201204, China.; Department of Gynecology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, No.2699 West Gaoke Road, Shanghai, 201204, China.; Department of Gynecology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, No.2699 West Gaoke Road, Shanghai, 201204, China.; School of Public Health, Hangzhou Normal University, No.2318 Yuhangtang Road, Yuhang District, Hangzhou, 311121, China. xuchenjie@hznu.edu.cn.; Department of Gynecology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Shanghai Institute of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, No.2699 West Gaoke Road, Shanghai, 201204, China. 1905009@tongji.edu.cn.",10.1186/s12966-024-01559-w

UK Biobank,34718565,Visual Impairment and Risk of Dementia in 2 Population-Based Prospective Cohorts: UK Biobank and EPIC-Norfolk.,"Visual impairment has emerged as a potential modifiable risk factor for dementia. However, there is a lack of large studies with objective measures of vision and with more than 10 years of follow-up. We investigated whether visual impairment is associated with an increased risk of incident dementia in UK Biobank and European Prospective Investigation into Cancer in Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk). In both cohorts, visual acuity was measured using a ""logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution"" (LogMAR) chart and categorized as no (≤0.30 LogMAR), mild (>0.3 to ≤0.50 LogMAR), and moderate to severe (>0.50 LogMAR) impairment. Dementia was ascertained through linkage to electronic medical records. After restricting to those aged ≥60 years, without prevalent dementia and with eye measures available, the analytic samples consisted of 62 206 UK Biobank and 7 337 EPIC-Norfolk participants, respectively. In UK Biobank and EPIC-Norfolk, respectively, 1 113 and 517 participants developed dementia over 11 and 15 years of follow-up. Using multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models, the hazard ratios for mild and moderate to severe visual impairment were 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92-1.72) and 2.16 (95% CI: 1.37-3.40), in UK Biobank, and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.72-1.53) and 1.93 (95% CI: 1.05-3.56) in EPIC-Norfolk, compared to no visual impairment. When excluding participants censored within 5 years of follow-up or with prevalent poor or fair self-reported health, the direction of the associations remained similar for moderate impairment but was not statistically significant. Our findings suggest visual impairment might be a promising target for dementia prevention; however, the possibility of reverse causation cannot be excluded.","Littlejohns, Thomas J; Hayat, Shabina; Luben, Robert; Brayne, Carol; Conroy, Megan; Foster, Paul J; Khawaja, Anthony P; Kuźma, Elżbieta","The journals of gerontology.

UK Biobank,38977844,Complex patterns of multimorbidity associated with severe COVID-19 and long COVID.,"Early evidence that patients with (multiple) pre-existing diseases are at highest risk for severe COVID-19 has been instrumental in the pandemic to allocate critical care resources and later vaccination schemes. However, systematic studies exploring the breadth of medical diagnoses are scarce but may help to understand severe COVID-19 among patients at supposedly low risk. We systematically harmonized >12 million primary care and hospitalisation health records from ~500,000 UK Biobank participants into 1448 collated disease terms to systematically identify diseases predisposing to severe COVID-19 (requiring hospitalisation or death) and its post-acute sequalae, Long COVID. Here we identify 679 diseases associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19 (n = 672) and/or Long COVID (n = 72) that span almost all clinical specialties and are strongly enriched in clusters of cardio-respiratory and endocrine-renal diseases. For 57 diseases, we establish consistent evidence to predispose to severe COVID-19 based on survival and genetic susceptibility analyses. This includes a possible role of symptoms of malaise and fatigue as a so far largely overlooked risk factor for severe COVID-19. We finally observe partially opposing risk estimates at known risk loci for severe COVID-19 for etiologically related diseases, such as post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis or rheumatoid arthritis, possibly indicating a segregation of disease mechanisms. Our results provide a unique reference that demonstrates how 1) complex co-occurrence of multiple - including non-fatal - conditions predispose to increased COVID-19 severity and 2) how incorporating the whole breadth of medical diagnosis can guide the interpretation of genetic risk loci. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic it was clear that people with multiple chronic diseases were vulnerable and needed special protection, such as shielding. However, many people without such diseases required hospital care or died from COVID-19. Here, we investigated the importance of underlying diseases, including mild diseases not requiring hospitalization, for COVID-19 outcomes. Using information from electronic health records we find that many severe, but also less severe diseases increase the risk for severe COVID-19 and its impact on health even months after acute infection (Long COVID). This included an almost two-fold higher risk among people that reported poor well-being and fatigue. Our findings show the value of using primary care health records and the need to consider all the medical history of patients to identify those in need of special protection.","Pietzner, Maik; Denaxas, Spiros; Yasmeen, Summaira; Ulmer, Maria A; Nakanishi, Tomoko; Arnold, Matthias; Kastenmüller, Gabi; Hemingway, Harry; Langenberg, Claudia",Communications medicine,2024,,,"Computational Medicine, Berlin Institute of Health at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. maik.pietzner@bih-charite.de.; Precision Healthcare University Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK. maik.pietzner@bih-charite.de.; MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. maik.pietzner@bih-charite.de.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK.; British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre, London, UK.; National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.; Computational Medicine, Berlin Institute of Health at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum München - German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.; Precision Healthcare University Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.; Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum München - German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.; Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum München - German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK. h.hemingway@ucl.ac.uk.; Health Data Research UK, London, UK. h.hemingway@ucl.ac.uk.; National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK. h.hemingway@ucl.ac.uk.; Computational Medicine, Berlin Institute of Health at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. claudia.langenberg@qmul.ac.uk.; Precision Healthcare University Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK. claudia.langenberg@qmul.ac.uk.; MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. claudia.langenberg@qmul.ac.uk.",10.1038/s43856-024-00506-x
UK Biobank,35007409,Early prediction of decompensation (EPOD) score: Non-invasive determination of cirrhosis decompensation risk.,"Decompensation is a hallmark of disease progression in cirrhotic patients. Early detection of a phase transition from compensated cirrhosis to decompensation would enable targeted therapeutic interventions potentially extending life expectancy. This study aims to (a) identify the predictors of decompensation in a large, multicentric cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis, (b) to build a reliable prognostic score for decompensation and (c) to evaluate the score in independent cohorts. Decompensation was identified in electronic health records data from 6049 cirrhosis patients in the IBM Explorys database training cohort by diagnostic codes for variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, ascites, hepato-renal syndrome and/or jaundice. We identified predictors of clinical decompensation and developed a prognostic score using Cox regression analysis. The score was evaluated using the IBM Explorys database validation cohort (N = 17662), the Penn Medicine BioBank (N = 1326) and the UK Biobank (N = 317). The new Early Prediction of Decompensation (EPOD) score uses platelet count, albumin, and bilirubin concentration. It predicts decompensation during a 3-year follow-up in three validation cohorts with AUROCs of 0.69, 0.69 and 0.77, respectively, and outperforms the well-known MELD and Child-Pugh score in predicting decompensation. Furthermore, the EPOD score predicted the 3-year probability of decompensation. The EPOD score provides a prediction tool for the risk of decompensation in patients with cirrhosis that outperforms well-known cirrhosis scores. Since EPOD is based on three blood parameters, only, it provides maximal clinical feasibility at minimal costs.","Schneider, Annika R P; Schneider, Carolin V; Schneider, Kai Markus; Baier, Vanessa; Schaper, Steffen; Diedrich, Christian; Coboeken, Katrin; Mayer, Hannah; Gu, Wenyi; Trebicka, Jonel; Blank, Lars M; Burghaus, Rolf; Lippert, Joerg; Rader, Daniel J; Thaiss, Christoph A; Schlender, Jan-Frederik; Trautwein, Christian; Kuepfer, Lars",Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,2022,Ascites; Esophageal and Gastric Varices; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index,cirrhosis; electronic health records; proportional hazards models; regression analysis; risk scores,"Institute of Applied Microbiology - iAMB, Aachen Biology and Biotechnology - ABBt, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.; Systems Pharmacology & Medicine, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany.; Division of Translational Medicine and Human Genetics, The Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Genetics, The Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Institute for Immunology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Institute for Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Institute of Applied Microbiology - iAMB, Aachen Biology and Biotechnology - ABBt, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.; Systems Pharmacology & Medicine, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany.; Systems Pharmacology & Medicine, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany.; Systems Pharmacology & Medicine, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany.; Systems Pharmacology & Medicine, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany.; Medical Department I, Frankfurt University Hospital, Leverkusen, Germany.; Medical Department I, Frankfurt University Hospital, Leverkusen, Germany.; European Foundation for Study of Chronic Liver Failure, Barcelona, Spain.; Institute of Applied Microbiology - iAMB, Aachen Biology and Biotechnology - ABBt, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.; Clinical Pharmacometrics, Bayer AG, Wuppertal, Germany.; Clinical Pharmacometrics, Bayer AG, Wuppertal, Germany.; Division of Translational Medicine and Human Genetics, The Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Genetics, The Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Microbiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Institute for Immunology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Institute for Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.; Systems Pharmacology & Medicine, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany.; Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Aachen, Aachen, Germany.; Institute for Systems Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.",10.1111/liv.15161
UK Biobank,36271874,A large genome-wide association study of QT interval length utilizing electronic health records.,"QT interval length is an important risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes; however, the genetic architecture of QT interval remains incompletely understood. We conducted a genome-wide association study of 76,995 ancestrally diverse Kaiser Permanente Northern California members enrolled in the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging cohort using 448,517 longitudinal QT interval measurements, uncovering 9 novel variants, most replicating in 40,537 individuals in the UK Biobank and Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology studies. A meta-analysis of all 3 cohorts (n = 117,532) uncovered an additional 19 novel variants. Conditional analysis identified 15 additional variants, 3 of which were novel. Little, if any, difference was seen when adjusting for putative QT interval lengthening medications genome-wide. Using multiple measurements in Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging increased variance explained by 163%, and we show that the ≈6 measurements in Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging was equivalent to a 2.4× increase in sample size of a design with a single measurement. The array heritability was estimated at ≈17%, approximately half of our estimate of 36% from family correlations. Heritability enrichment was estimated highest and most significant in cardiovascular tissue (enrichment 7.2, 95% CI = 5.7-8.7, P = 2.1e-10), and many of the novel variants included expression quantitative trait loci in heart and other relevant tissues. Comparing our results to other cardiac function traits, it appears that QT interval has a multifactorial genetic etiology.","Hoffmann, Thomas J; Lu, Meng; Oni-Orisan, Akinyemi; Lee, Catherine; Risch, Neil; Iribarren, Carlos",Genetics,2022,"Adult; Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Electronic Health Records; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Phenotype",QT interval; electronic health records; genome-wide association study; medication; repeated measurements,"Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA 94612, USA.; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.; Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA 94612, USA.; Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA 94612, USA.; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA 94612, USA.",10.1093/genetics/iyac157
UK Biobank,37310738,Estimating Dementia Risk Using Multifactorial Prediction Models.,"The clinical value of current multifactorial algorithms for individualized assessment of dementia risk remains unclear. To evaluate the clinical value associated with 4 widely used dementia risk scores in estimating 10-year dementia risk. This prospective population-based UK Biobank cohort study assessed 4 dementia risk scores at baseline (2006-2010) and ascertained incident dementia during the following 10 years. Replication with a 20-year follow-up was based on the British Whitehall II study. For both analyses, participants who had no dementia at baseline, had complete data on at least 1 dementia risk score, and were linked to electronic health records from hospitalizations or mortality were included. Data analysis was conducted from July 5, 2022, to April 20, 2023. Four existing dementia risk scores: the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE)-Clinical score, the CAIDE-APOE-supplemented score, the Brief Dementia Screening Indicator (BDSI), and the Australian National University Alzheimer Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI). Dementia was ascertained from linked electronic health records. To evaluate how well each score predicted the 10-year risk of dementia, concordance (C) statistics, detection rate, false-positive rate, and the ratio of true to false positives were calculated for each risk score and for a model including age alone. Of 465 929 UK Biobank participants without dementia at baseline (mean [SD] age, 56.5 [8.1] years; range, 38-73 years; 252 778 [54.3%] female participants), 3421 were diagnosed with dementia at follow-up (7.5 per 10 000 person-years). If the threshold for a positive test result was calibrated to achieve a 5% false-positive rate, all 4 risk scores detected 9% to 16% of incident dementia and therefore missed 84% to 91% (failure rate). The corresponding failure rate was 84% for a model that included age only. For a positive test result calibrated to detect at least half of future incident dementia, the ratio of true to false positives ranged between 1 to 66 (for CAIDE-APOE-supplemented) and 1 to 116 (for ANU-ADRI). For age alone, the ratio was 1 to 43. The C statistic was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.65-0.67) for the CAIDE clinical version, 0.73 (95% CI, 0.72-0.73) for the CAIDE-APOE-supplemented, 0.68 (95% CI, 0.67-0.69) for BDSI, 0.59 (95% CI, 0.58-0.60) for ANU-ADRI, and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.79-0.80) for age alone. Similar C statistics were seen for 20-year dementia risk in the Whitehall II study cohort, which included 4865 participants (mean [SD] age, 54.9 [5.9] years; 1342 [27.6%] female participants). In a subgroup analysis of same-aged participants aged 65 (±1) years, discriminatory capacity of risk scores was low (C statistics between 0.52 and 0.60). In these cohort studies, individualized assessments of dementia risk using existing risk prediction scores had high error rates. These findings suggest that the scores were of limited value in targeting people for dementia prevention. Further research is needed to develop more accurate algorithms for estimation of dementia risk.","Kivimäki, Mika; Livingston, Gill; Singh-Manoux, Archana; Mars, Nina; Lindbohm, Joni V; Pentti, Jaana; Nyberg, Solja T; Pirinen, Matti; Anderson, Emma L; Hingorani, Aroon D; Sipilä, Pyry N",JAMA network open,2023,Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Male; Australia; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; Aging; Apolipoproteins E,,"Department of Mental Health of Older People, UCL Brain Sciences, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Mental Health of Older People, UCL Brain Sciences, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Mental Health of Older People, UCL Brain Sciences, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Université Paris Cité, Inserm U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Paris, France.; Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Department of Mental Health of Older People, UCL Brain Sciences, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Mental Health of Older People, UCL Brain Sciences, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit and Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol Medical School, Bristol, United Kingdom.; Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.18132
UK Biobank,37909388,Association of Somatic TET2 Mutations With Giant Cell Arteritis.,"Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an age-related vasculitis. Prior studies have identified an association between GCA and hematologic malignancies (HMs). How the presence of somatic mutations that drive the development of HMs, or clonal hematopoiesis (CH), may influence clinical outcomes in GCA is not well understood. To examine an association between CH and GCA, we analyzed sequenced exomes of 470,960 UK Biobank (UKB) participants for the presence of CH and used multivariable Cox regression. To examine the clinical phenotype of GCA in patients with and without somatic mutations across the spectrum of CH to HM, we performed targeted sequencing of blood samples and electronic health record review on 114 patients with GCA seen at our institution. We then examined associations between specific clonal mutations and GCA disease manifestations. UKB participants with CH had a 1.48-fold increased risk of incident GCA compared to UKB participants without CH. GCA risk was highest among individuals with cytopenia (hazard ratio [HR] 2.98, P = 0.00178) and with TET2 mutation (HR 2.02, P = 0.00116). Mutations were detected in 27.2% of our institutional GCA cohort, three of whom had HM at GCA diagnosis. TET2 mutations were associated with vision loss in patients with GCA (odds ratio 4.33, P = 0.047). CH increases risk for development of GCA in a genotype-specific manner, with the greatest risk being conferred by the presence of mutations in TET2. Somatic TET2 mutations likewise increase the risk of GCA-associated vision loss. Integration of somatic genetic testing in GCA diagnostics may be warranted in the future.","Robinette, Michelle L; Weeks, Lachelle D; Kramer, Ryan J; Agrawal, Mridul; Gibson, Christopher J; Yu, Zhi; Sekar, Aswin; Mehta, Arnav; Niroula, Abhishek; Brown, Jared T; McDermott, Gregory C; Reshef, Edith R; Lu, Jonathan E; Liou, Victor D; Chiou, Carolina A; Natarajan, Pradeep; Freitag, Suzanne K; Rao, Deepak A; Ebert, Benjamin L","Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",2024,Humans; Giant Cell Arteritis; Mutation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Dioxygenases,,"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Center for Leukemia and Center for Early Detection and Interception of Blood Cancers, Boston, Massachusetts.; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, and Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.; The Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, and Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.; Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston.; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, The Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, and Lund University, Lund, Sweden.; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.; Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.; Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; The Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, and Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, The Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.",10.1002/art.42738
UK Biobank,38886095,Severe psychiatric disorders are associated with increased risk of dementia.,"Individuals with psychiatric disorders have an increased risk of developing dementia. Most cross-sectional studies suffer from selection bias, underdiagnosis and poor population representation, while there is only limited evidence from longitudinal studies on the role of anxiety, bipolar and psychotic disorders. Electronic health records (EHRs) permit large cohorts to be followed across the lifespan and include a wide range of diagnostic information. To assess the association between four groups of psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder/mania, depression and anxiety) with dementia in two large population-based samples with EHR. Using EHR on nearly 1 million adult individuals in Wales, and from 228 937 UK Biobank participants, we studied the relationships between schizophrenia, mania/bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety and subsequent risk of dementia. In Secure Anonymised Information Linkage, there was a steep increase in the incidence of a first diagnosis of psychiatric disorder in the years prior to the diagnosis of dementia, reaching a peak in the year prior to dementia diagnosis for all psychiatric diagnoses. Psychiatric disorders, except anxiety, were highly significantly associated with a subsequent diagnosis of dementia: HRs=2.87, 2.80, 1.63 for schizophrenia, mania/bipolar disorder and depression, respectively. A similar pattern was found in the UK Biobank (HRs=4.46, 3.65, 2.39, respectively) and anxiety was also associated with dementia (HR=1.34). Increased risk of dementia was observed for all ages at onset of psychiatric diagnoses when these were divided into 10-year bins. Psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk of subsequent dementia, with a greater risk of more severe disorders. A late onset of psychiatric disorders should alert clinicians of possible incipient dementia.","Stevenson-Hoare, Joshua; Legge, Sophie E; Simmonds, Emily; Han, Jun; Owen, Michael J; O'Donovan, Michael; Kirov, George; Escott-Price, Valentina",BMJ mental health,2024,"Humans; Dementia; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Adult; Mental Disorders; Wales; Electronic Health Records; Bipolar Disorder; United Kingdom; Schizophrenia; Risk Factors; Aged, 80 and over; Incidence","Adult psychiatry; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Depression & mood disorders; Schizophrenia & psychotic disorders","Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; UK Dementia Research Institute at Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK EscottPriceV@cardiff.ac.uk kirov@cardiff.ac.uk.; Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK EscottPriceV@cardiff.ac.uk kirov@cardiff.ac.uk.",10.1136/bmjment-2024-301097
UK Biobank,36648468,Association of Supernumerary Sex Chromosome Aneuploidies With Venous Thromboembolism.,"An increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been reported in men with an additional sex chromosome. The association between other sex chromosome aneuploidies and VTE is not well characterized. To determine if sex chromosome aneuploidy is associated with VTE. Retrospective cohort study of sex chromosome aneuploidy and VTE, performed by analyzing X- and Y-chromosome dosage and VTE incidence in 642 544 individuals from 2 population-scale biobanks: the US Geisinger MyCode Community Health Initiative (N = 154 519) and the UK Biobank (N = 488 025); analysis was limited to participants self-identified as White because of inadequate sample sizes for other race and ethnicity groups. A total of 108 461 unrelated MyCode participants with electronic health record follow-up ranging from September 1996 to December 2020 and 418 725 unrelated British and Irish UK Biobank participants who attended the baseline assessment between March 2006 and October 2010, with follow-up extending to November 2020, were included in analyses of VTE. Sex chromosome aneuploidies. Individuals with 1 primary inpatient VTE diagnosis, 2 primary outpatient VTE diagnoses, or a self-reported VTE diagnosis were defined as VTE cases. P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Identification of sex chromosome aneuploidy was undertaken among 642 544 individuals aged 18 to 90 years. Identification of a diagnosis of VTE was undertaken among 108 461 unrelated MyCode participants (65 565 [60.5%] female; mean age at last visit, 58.0 [SD, 17.6] years; median follow-up, 15.3 [IQR, 9.7] years) and among 418 725 unrelated UK Biobank participants (224 695 [53.7%] female; mean age at baseline interview, 56.9 [SD, 8.0] years; median follow-up, 12.0 [IQR, 1.6] years). Among MyCode participants, during 10 years of follow-up, 17 incident VTE events per 1353 person-years were detected among those with supernumerary sex chromosome aneuploidy (1.3% per person-year) compared with 2060 per 816 682 person-years among those with 46,XX or 46,XY (0.25% per person-year) (hazard ratio, 5.4 [95% CI, 3.4-8.7]; 10-year risk difference, 8.8% [95% CI, 4.2%-14.0%]; P < .001). Among UK Biobank participants, during 10 years of follow-up, 16 incident VTE events per 3803 person-years were detected among those with supernumerary sex chromosome aneuploidy (0.42% per person-year) compared with 4491 per 3 970 467 person-years among those with 46,XX or 46,XY (0.11% per person-year) (hazard ratio, 4.1 [95% CI, 2.5-6.7]; 10-year risk difference, 3.7% [95% CI, 1.4%-5.9%]; P < .001).

UK Biobank,36265482,Liability-scale heritability estimation for biobank studies of low-prevalence disease.,"Theory for liability-scale models of the underlying genetic basis of complex disease provides an important way to interpret, compare, and understand results generated from biological studies. In particular, through estimation of the liability-scale heritability (LSH), liability models facilitate an understanding and comparison of the relative importance of genetic and environmental risk factors that shape different clinically important disease outcomes. Increasingly, large-scale biobank studies that link genetic information to electronic health records, containing hundreds of disease diagnosis indicators that mostly occur infrequently within the sample, are becoming available. Here, we propose an extension of the existing liability-scale model theory suitable for estimating LSH in biobank studies of low-prevalence disease. In a simulation study, we find that our derived expression yields lower mean square error (MSE) and is less sensitive to prevalence misspecification as compared to previous transformations for diseases with ≤2% population prevalence and LSH of ≤0.45, especially if the biobank sample prevalence is less than that of the wider population. Applying our expression to 13 diagnostic outcomes of ≤3% prevalence in the UK Biobank study revealed important differences in LSH obtained from the different theoretical expressions that impact the conclusions made when comparing LSH across disease outcomes. This demonstrates the importance of careful consideration for estimation and prediction of low-prevalence disease outcomes and facilitates improved inference of the underlying genetic basis of ≤2% population prevalence diseases, especially where biobank sample ascertainment results in a healthier sample population.","Ojavee, Sven E; Kutalik, Zoltan; Robinson, Matthew R",American journal of human genetics,2022,Humans; Biological Specimen Banks; Prevalence; Causality; Computer Simulation; Genome-Wide Association Study,GWAS; biobanks; liability-scale heritability,"Department of Computational Biology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Computational Biology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland; University Center for Primary Care and Public Health, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Institute of Science and Technology Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria.

UK Biobank,40425295,Lung cancer risk assessment by prediction model: a global perspective.,"Numerous lung cancer risk prediction models have been developed and validated worldwide. It is imperative to offer a comprehensive overview and comparative analysis of their performances. We conducted an extensive literature search to identify studies developing and/or validating lung cancer risk prediction models. Then we summarised and compared the external performance of these models, focusing on discriminative accuracy (C-index) and calibration performance (E:O ratio). After an initial screening of 10 210 articles, 35 studies on 21 distinct prediction models were identified, which used 42 different types of predictors spanning seven categories. Notable performance variations were observed in external validations. In North American cohorts, the C-index ranged from 0.60 to 0.87, with E:O ratios from 0.62 to 3.70. Among the European cohorts, the Trøndelag health study HUNT and CanPredict exhibited C-indices surpassing 0.870. Conversely, the Bach, lung cancer risk assessment tool (LCRAT), prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancer screening (PLCO) Performance of lung cancer risk prediction models, despite being well developed and validated, varies in diverse populations.

Decreased expression of MAEL in the brain was significantly associated (Bonferroni-adjusted p < 0.05) with hydrocephalus. PrediXcan analysis of brain imaging and genomics data in the independent UK Biobank (N = 8,428) revealed that MAEL expression in the frontal cortex is associated with white matter and total brain volumes. Among the top differentially expressed genes in brain, we observed a significant enrichment for gene-level associations with these structural phenotypes, suggesting an effect on disease risk through regulation of brain structure and integrity. We found additional support for these genes through analysis of the choroid plexus transcriptome of a murine model of hydrocephalus. Finally, differential protein expression analysis in patient cerebrospinal fluid recapitulated disease-associated expression changes in neurological tissues, but not in whole blood.

The mechanism for greenspace's influences on cancer incidence may be through reducing depressive symptoms and increasing physical activity. Our study aimed to investigate the associations between exposure to residential greenspace and the risk of common types of cancer and whether the associations were modified or mediated by depressive symptoms and physical activity. This prospective cohort study included 401,189 participants in the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010 who were free of cancer and followed up until 2021. Residential greenspace was defined as the percentage of outdoor greenspace surrounding the residential location of each participant across 1000 m and 300 m buffers, which were estimated with land use data. Electronic health records were used to assess the incidence of 25 types of cancer. Cox proportional hazards regressions were performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) per an interquartile range (IQR) increase of greenspace after multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. During a median follow-up of 12.4 years, a total of 43,273 incident cancer cases were documented. We found that exposure to greenspace at a 1000 m buffer was significantly associated with prostate cancer (HR = 0.93, 95 % CI: 0.89-0.96), and suggestively associated with oral cavity (HR = 0.86, 95 % CI: 0.76-0.98) and bladder cancer (HR = 1.08, 95 % CI: 1.01-1.15), but not with other cancers. Moreover, the association between greenspace and prostate cancer was mediated by physical activity, and was modified by depressive symptoms (P for heterogeneity = 0.022). Similar findings were also observed for greenspace at a 300 m buffer. Our study revealed an association between exposure to greenspace and prostate cancer, but not with other cancers.","Cao, Zhi; Xu, Chenjie; Li, Shu; Wang, Yaogang; Yang, Hongxi",The Science of the total environment,2023,"Male; Humans; Prospective Studies; Biological Specimen Banks; Parks, Recreational; Prostatic Neoplasms; United Kingdom",Depressive symptoms; Greenspace; Physical activity; Prostate cancer; cancer,"School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China; School of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; School of Public Health, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.; School of Integrative Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.; School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.; School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China; Department of Bioinformatics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.

UK Biobank,35032742,Prediagnostic Progressive Supranuclear Palsy - Insights from the UK Biobank.,"Prediagnostic features of Parkinson's Disease are well described but prediagnostic Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is less understood. The diagnosis of PSP is delayed by an average of three years after symptom onset. Understanding the changes that occur in the prediagnostic period will aid earlier diagnosis, clarify the natural history, and may aid the design of early disease-modifying therapy trials. We set out to identify motor and cognitive markers of prediagnostic PSP, with Parkinson's disease as a comparator condition, in a large prospective cohort. Baseline UK Biobank data from 502,504 individuals were collected between 2006 and 2010. Subsequent PSP and Parkinson's disease cases were identified from primary and secondary care electronic health records' diagnostic coding data and death registry, with 5404 matched controls. 176 PSP cases (time to diagnosis 7.8 ± 2.8 years) and 2526 Parkinson's disease cases (time to diagnosis 7.8 ± 2.9 years) were identified. At baseline, those later diagnosed with PSP had slower reaction times, weaker hand grip, lower fluid intelligence, prospective memory, self-rated health scores and digit recall than controls. Reaction times were correlated with time to diagnosis. The PSP group had higher mortality than both Parkinson's disease and control groups. Motor slowing, cognitive dysfunction, and postural instability are clinical diagnostic features of PSP that are typically symptomatic three years before diagnosis. Objective markers of these features were evident on average 7.8 years before diagnosis. Our findings suggest the existence of a long prediagnostic phase in PSP, with subtle changes in motor and cognitive function.","Street, Duncan; Whiteside, David; Rittman, Timothy; Rowe, James B",Parkinsonism & related disorders,2022,"Biological Specimen Banks; Hand Strength; Humans; Parkinson Disease; Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive; United Kingdom",Parkinson's Disease; Prodromal markers; Progressive supranuclear palsy; Prospective,"University of Cambridge, Department of Clinical Neurosciences and Cambridge University Hospitals, NHS Trust, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; University of Cambridge, Department of Clinical Neurosciences and Cambridge University Hospitals, NHS Trust, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; University of Cambridge, Department of Clinical Neurosciences and Cambridge University Hospitals, NHS Trust, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; University of Cambridge, Department of Clinical Neurosciences and Cambridge University Hospitals, NHS Trust, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.

New evidence suggests a potential association between glucosamine and type 2 diabetes, inflammation and cardiometabolic risk. We aimed to prospectively evaluate the association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of diabetic microvascular complications based on data from the large-scale nationwide prospective UK Biobank cohort study. This analysis included 21,171 participants with type 2 diabetes who were free of microvascular complications from the UK Biobank. Incidence of diabetic microvascular complications was ascertained via electronic health records. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the relationship between glucosamine use and the risk of diabetic microvascular complications. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the potential effect modifications and the robustness of the main findings. At baseline, 14.5% of the participants reported habitual use of glucosamine supplements. During a median follow-up of 12.3 years, 4399 people developed diabetic microvascular complications, including 2084 cases of incident diabetic nephropathy, 2401 incident diabetic retinopathy, and 831 incident diabetic neuropathy.

UK Biobank,35764673,Environmental variables and genome-environment interactions predicting IBD diagnosis in large UK cohort.,"A combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure is thought to cause inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the non-genetic component remains poorly characterized. We therefore undertook a search for environmental variables and gene-environment interactions associated with future IBD diagnosis in a large UK cohort. Using self-report and electronic health records, we identified 1946 Crohn's disease (CD) and 3715 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients after quality control in the UK Biobank. Based on prior literature and biological plausibility , we tested 38 candidate environmental variables for association with CD, UC, and overall IBD using Cox proportional hazard regressions. We also tested whether these variables interacted with polygenic risk in predicting disease, following up significant (FDR < 0.05) results with tests for SNP-environment associations. We performed robustness analyses on all significant results. As in previous reports, appendectomy protected against UC, smoking (both current and previous) elevated risk for CD, current smoking protected against UC, and previous smoking imparted a risk for UC. Childhood antibiotic use associated with IBD, as did sun exposure during the winter. Socioeconomic deprivation was conferred a risk for IBD, CD, and UC. We uncovered negative interactions between polygenic risk and previous oral contraceptive use for IBD and UC. Polygenic risk also interacted negatively with previous smoking in predicting UC. There were no individually significant SNP-environment interactions. Thus, for a limited set of environmental variables, there was strong evidence of association with IBD diagnosis in the UK Biobank, and interaction with polygenic risk was minimal.","Yang, Alan Z; Jostins-Dean, Luke",Scientific reports,2022,"Child; Colitis, Ulcerative; Crohn Disease; Gene-Environment Interaction; Humans; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; United Kingdom",,"New College, Oxford, UK.; Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, University of Oxford, Roosevelt Drive, Headington, OX3 7FY, Oxfordshire, UK. luke.jostins@kennedy.ox.ac.uk.",10.1038/s41598-022-13222-0
UK Biobank,40397457,Polygenic Prediction of Peripheral Artery Disease and Major Adverse Limb Events.,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a heritable atherosclerotic condition associated with functional decline and high risk for limb loss. With growing knowledge of the genetic basis for PAD and related risk factors, there is potential opportunity to identify individuals at high risk using polygenic risk scores (PRSs). To develop a novel integrated, multiancestry polygenic score for PAD (PRS-PAD) and evaluate its risk estimation for PAD and major adverse limb events in 3 populations. This longitudinal cohort study was conducted among individuals with genotyping and electronic health record data in the UK Biobank (2006-2021), All of Us (AoU, 2018-2022), and the Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB, 2010-2023). Data were analyzed from July 2023 to February 2025. PRS-PAD, previously published PAD polygenic scores, and clinical risk factors. The primary outcomes were PAD and major adverse limb events, defined as a surrogate of major amputation and acute limb ischemia. The study populations included 400 533 individuals from the UK Biobank (median [IQR] age, 58.2 [45.0-71.4] years; 216 215 female participants [53.9%]), 218 500 from AoU (median [IQR] age, 53.6 [37.7-65.0] years; 132 647 female participants [60.7%]), and 32 982 from MGBB (median [IQR] age, 56.0 [32.0-80.0] years; 18 277 female participants [55.4%]). In the UK Biobank validation cohort, PRS-PAD was associated with an odds ratio [OR] per SD increase of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.60-1.68; P < .001). After adjusting for clinical risk factors, the OR for the top 20% of PRS-PAD was 1.68 (95% CI, 1.62-1.74; P < .001) compared to the remainder of the population. Among PAD cases without a history of diabetes, smoking, or chronic kidney disease (n = 3645), 1097 individuals (30.1%) had a high PRS-PAD (top 20%). In incident disease analysis, PRS-PAD improved discrimination (C statistic, 0.761), which was nearly equivalent to the performances of diabetes (C statistic, 0.760) and smoking (C statistic, 0.765). Among individuals with prevalent PAD, high PRS-PAD was associated with an increased risk of incident major adverse limb events in the UK Biobank (hazard ratio [HR], 1.75; 95% CI, 1.18-2.57; P = .005), MGBB (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.06-2.30; P = .02), and AoU (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.06-2.33; P = .03). This cohort study develops a new PRS that stratifies risk of PAD and adverse limb outcomes. Incorporating polygenic risk into PAD care warrants further investigation to guide screening and tailor management to prevent major adverse limb events.","Flores, Alyssa M; Ruan, Yunfeng; Misra, Anika; Cho, So Mi Jemma; Selvaraj, Margaret S; Bellomo, Tiffany R; Nakao, Tetsushi; Rosenfield, Kenneth; Eagleton, Matthew; Hornsby, Whitney; Patel, Aniruddh P; Natarajan, Pradeep",JAMA cardiology,2025,,,"Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.; Associate Editor, JAMA Cardiology.",10.1001/jamacardio.2025.1182
UK Biobank,34529658,On cross-ancestry cancer polygenic risk scores.,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) can provide useful information for personalized risk stratification and disease risk assessment, especially when combined with non-genetic risk factors. However, their construction depends on the availability of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) independent from the target sample. For best compatibility, it was reported that GWAS and the target sample should match in terms of ancestries. Yet, GWAS, especially in the field of cancer, often lack diversity and are predominated by European ancestry. This bias is a limiting factor in PRS research. By using electronic health records and genetic data from the UK Biobank, we contrast the utility of breast and prostate cancer PRS derived from external European-ancestry-based GWAS across African, East Asian, European, and South Asian ancestry groups. We highlight differences in the PRS distributions of these groups that are amplified when PRS methods condense hundreds of thousands of variants into a single score. While European-GWAS-derived PRS were not directly transferrable across ancestries on an absolute scale, we establish their predictive potential when considering them separately within each group. For example, the top 10% of the breast cancer PRS distributions within each ancestry group each revealed significant enrichments of breast cancer cases compared to the bottom 90% (odds ratio of 2.81 [95%CI: 2.69,2.93] in European, 2.88 [1.85, 4.48] in African, 2.60 [1.25, 5.40] in East Asian, and 2.33 [1.55, 3.51] in South Asian individuals). Our findings highlight a compromise solution for PRS research to compensate for the lack of diversity in well-powered European GWAS efforts while recruitment of diverse participants in the field catches up.","Fritsche, Lars G; Ma, Ying; Zhang, Daiwei; Salvatore, Maxwell; Lee, Seunggeun; Zhou, Xiang; Mukherjee, Bhramar",PLoS genetics,2021,Breast Neoplasms; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Multifactorial Inheritance,,"Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Graduate School of Data Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Michigan Institute for Data Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.",10.1371/journal.pgen.1009670
UK Biobank,37292770,Insights into human health from phenome- and genome-wide analyses of UK Biobank retinal optical coherence tomography phenotypes.,"The human retina is a complex multi-layered tissue which offers a unique window into systemic health and disease. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used in eye care and allows the non-invasive, rapid capture of retinal measurements in exquisite detail. We conducted genome- and phenome-wide analyses of retinal layer thicknesses using macular OCT images from 44,823 UK Biobank participants. We performed phenome-wide association analyses, associating retinal thicknesses with 1,866 incident ICD-based conditions (median 10-year follow-up) and 88 quantitative traits and blood biomarkers. We performed genome-wide association analyses, identifying inherited genetic markers which influence the retina, and replicated our associations among 6,313 individuals from the LIFE-Adult Study. And lastly, we performed comparative association of phenome- and genome- wide associations to identify putative causal links between systemic conditions, retinal layer thicknesses, and ocular disease. Independent associations with incident mortality were detected for photoreceptor thinning and ganglion cell complex thinning. Significant phenotypic associations were detected between retinal layer thinning and ocular, neuropsychiatric, cardiometabolic and pulmonary conditions. Genome-wide association of retinal layer thicknesses yielded 259 loci. Consistency between epidemiologic and genetic associations suggested putative causal links between thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer with glaucoma, photoreceptor segment with AMD, as well as poor cardiometabolic and pulmonary function with PS thinning, among other findings. In conclusion, retinal layer thinning predicts risk of future ocular and systemic disease. Furthermore, systemic cardio-metabolic-pulmonary conditions promote retinal thinning. Retinal imaging biomarkers, integrated into electronic health records, may inform risk prediction and potential therapeutic strategies.","Zekavat, Seyedeh Maryam; Jorshery, Saman Doroodgar; Shweikh, Yusrah; Horn, Katrin; Rauscher, Franziska G; Sekimitsu, Sayuri; Kayoma, Satoshi; Ye, Yixuan; Raghu, Vineet; Zhao, Hongyu; Ghassemi, Marzyeh; Elze, Tobias; Segrè, Ayellet V; Wiggs, Janey L; Scholz, Markus; Priore, Lucian Del; Wang, Jay C; Natarajan, Pradeep; Zebardast, Nazlee",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2023,,,"Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics and Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics and Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Departments of Computer Science/Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.; Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Cardiovascular Imaging Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology University of Leipzig, Germany and Leipzig Research Centre for Civilization Diseases (LIFE), Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.; Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology University of Leipzig, Germany and Leipzig Research Centre for Civilization Diseases (LIFE), Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.; Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics and Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Program, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics and Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Cardiovascular Imaging Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Program, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.; School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.; Departments of Computer Science/Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.; Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology University of Leipzig, Germany and Leipzig Research Centre for Civilization Diseases (LIFE), Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.; Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Northern California Retina Vitreous Associates, Mountain View, CA.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics and Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics and Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.",10.1101/2023.05.16.23290063

UK Biobank,39380376,Genetic Heterogeneity Across Dimensions of Alcohol Use Behaviors.,"Increasingly large samples in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for alcohol use behaviors (AUBs) have led to an influx of implicated genes, yet the clinical and functional understanding of these associations remains low, in part because most GWASs do not account for the complex and varied manifestations of AUBs. This study applied a multidimensional framework to investigate the latent genetic structure underlying heterogeneous dimensions of AUBs. Multimodal assessments (self-report, interview, electronic health records) were obtained from approximately 400,000 UK Biobank participants. GWAS was conducted for 18 distinct AUBs, including consumption, drinking patterns, alcohol problems, and clinical sequelae. Latent genetic factors were identified and carried forward to GWAS using genomic structural equation modeling, followed by functional annotation, genetic correlation, and enrichment analyses to interpret the genetic associations. Four latent factors were identified: Problems, Consumption, BeerPref (declining alcohol consumption with a preference for drinking beer), and AtypicalPref (drinking fortified wine and spirits). The latent factors were moderately correlated (r Deep phenotyping is an important next step to improve understanding of the genetic etiology of AUBs, in addition to increasing sample size. Further effort is required to uncover the genetic heterogeneity underlying AUBs using methods that account for their complex, multidimensional nature.","Savage, Jeanne E; Barr, Peter B; Phung, Tanya; Lee, Younga H; Zhang, Yingzhe; McCutcheon, Vivia V; Ge, Tian; Smoller, Jordan W; Davis, Lea K; Meyers, Jacquelyn; Porjesz, Bernice; Posthuma, Danielle; Mallard, Travis T; Sanchez-Roige, Sandra",The American journal of psychiatry,2024,Humans; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alcohol Drinking; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Genetic Heterogeneity; United Kingdom; Aged; Adult; Alcoholism,Alcohol; GWAS; Genetics/Genomics; Genomic Structural Equation Modeling; Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders,"Department of Complex Trait Genetics, Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (Savage, Phung, Posthuma); Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, Brooklyn, New York (Barr, Meyers, Porjesz); VA New York Harbor Healthcare System, Brooklyn, New York (Barr, Meyers); Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Genetics Unit, Center for Genomic Medicine (Lee, Zhang, Ge, Smoller, Mallard), and Center for Precision Psychiatry (Ge, Smoller), Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston; Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston (Lee, Ge, Smoller, Mallard); Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge (Lee, Zhang, Ge, Smoller, Mallard); Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

UK Biobank,35595084,Multiancestral polygenic risk score for pediatric asthma.,"Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and the third leading cause of hospitalization in pediatrics. The genome-wide association study catalog reports 140 studies with genome-wide significance. A polygenic risk score (PRS) with predictive value across ancestries has not been evaluated for this important trait. This study aimed to train and validate a PRS relying on genetic determinants for asthma to provide predictions for disease occurrence in pediatric cohorts of diverse ancestries. This study applied a Bayesian regression framework method using the Trans-National Asthma Genetic Consortium genome-wide association study summary statistics to derive a multiancestral PRS score, used one Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) cohort as a training set, used a second independent eMERGE cohort to validate the score, and used the UK Biobank data to replicate the findings. A phenome-wide association study was performed using the PRS to identify shared genetic etiology with other phenotypes. The multiancestral asthma PRS was associated with asthma in the 2 pediatric validation datasets. Overall, the multiancestral asthma PRS has an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.69-0.72) in the pediatric validation 1 and AUC of 0.66 (0.65-0.66) in the pediatric validation 2 datasets. We found significant discrimination across pediatric subcohorts of European (AUC, 95% CI, 0.60 and 0.66), African (AUC, 95% CI, 0.61 and 0.66), admixed American (AUC, 0.64 and 0.70), Southeast Asian (AUC, 0.65), and East Asian (AUC, 0.73) ancestry. Pediatric participants with the top 5% PRS had 2.80 to 5.82 increased odds of asthma compared to the bottom 5% across the training, validation 1, and validation 2 cohorts when adjusted for ancestry. Phenome-wide association study analysis confirmed the strong association of the identified PRS with asthma (odds ratio, 2.71, P A multiancestral PRS for asthma based on Bayesian posterior genomic effect sizes identifies increased odds of pediatric asthma.","Namjou, Bahram;

UK Biobank,34897458,Curating a longitudinal research resource using linked primary care EHR data-a UK Biobank case study.,"Primary care EHR data are often of clinical importance to cohort studies however they require careful handling. Challenges include determining the periods during which EHR data were collected. Participants are typically censored when they deregister from a medical practice, however, cohort studies wish to follow participants longitudinally including those that change practice. Using UK Biobank as an exemplar, we developed methodology to infer continuous periods of data collection and maximize follow-up in longitudinal studies. This resulted in longer follow-up for around 40% of participants with multiple registration records (mean increase of 3.8 years from the first study visit). The approach did not sacrifice phenotyping accuracy when comparing agreement between self-reported and EHR data. A diabetes mellitus case study illustrates how the algorithm supports longitudinal study design and provides further validation. We use UK Biobank data, however, the tools provided can be used for other conditions and studies with minimal alteration.","Darke, Philip; Cassidy, Sophie; Catt, Michael; Taylor, Roy; Missier, Paolo; Bacardit, Jaume",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2022,Biological Specimen Banks; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Primary Health Care; United Kingdom,diabetes mellitus; electronic health records; longitudinal studies; medical record linkage; phenotype,"School of Computing, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.; Central Clinical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.; Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.; Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.; School of Computing, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.; School of Computing, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.",10.1093/jamia/ocab260

UK Biobank,38109175,Device-Measured Physical Activity in 3506 Individuals with Knee or Hip Arthroplasty.,"Hip and knee arthroplasty aims to reduce joint pain and increase functional mobility in patients with osteoarthritis; however, the degree to which arthroplasty is associated with higher physical activity is unclear. The current study sought to assess the association of hip and knee arthroplasty with objectively measured physical activity. This cross-sectional study analyzed wrist-worn accelerometer data collected in 2013-2016 from UK Biobank participants (aged 43-78 yr). Multivariable linear regression was performed to assess step count, cadence, overall acceleration, and activity behaviors between nonarthritic controls, end-stage arthritic, and postoperative cohorts, controlling for demographic and behavioral confounders. From a cohort of 94,707 participants with valid accelerometer wear time and complete self-reported data, electronic health records were used to identify 3506 participants having undergone primary or revision hip or knee arthroplasty and 68,389 nonarthritic controls. End-stage hip or knee arthritis was associated with taking 1129 fewer steps per day (95% confidence interval (CI), 811-1447; P < 0.001) and having 5.8 fewer minutes per day (95% CI, 3.0-8.7; P < 0.001) of moderate-to-vigorous activity compared with nonarthritic controls. Unilateral primary hip and knee arthroplasties were associated with 877 (95% CI, 284-1471; P = 0.004) and 893 (95% CI, 232-1554; P = 0.008) more steps than end-stage osteoarthritic participants, respectively. Postoperative unilateral hip arthroplasty participants demonstrated levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and daily step count equivalent to nonarthritic controls. No difference in physical activity was observed between any cohorts in terms of overall acceleration, or time spent in daily light activity, sedentary behavior, or sleep. Hip and knee arthroplasties are associated with higher levels of physical activity compared with participants with end-stage arthritis. Unilateral hip arthroplasty patients, in particular, demonstrate equivalence to nonarthritic peers at more than 1 yr after surgery.","Small, Scott R; Khalid, Sara; Price, Andrew J; Doherty, Aiden",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2024,"Humans; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Osteoarthritis, Knee",,"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, UNITED KINGDOM.; Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, UNITED KINGDOM.",10.1249/MSS.0000000000003365
UK Biobank,39809352,Evidence for a causal link between lipoprotein (a) and mental disorders: A retrospective and Mendelian randomization study.,"Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is a biomarker of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but its role in mental disorders is controversial. Our study aimed to explore the causality between Lp(a) levels and mental disorders by combining retrospective and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. All genome-wide association study datasets used in the MR study were obtained from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. The matched case-control study were based on electronic health records from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University and NHANES III cohort. In the MR analysis, Lp(a) had a positive causal effect on the longest period of depression [1.05 (1.02-1.08), P = 0.0001], the number of depressive episodes [1.03 (1.01-1.06), P = 0.009] and a weak negative effect on memory loss [0.84 (0.72-0.99), P = 0.039]. Meanwhile, bipolar and major depressive disorder status was causally associated with significantly lower Lp(a) levels [0.96 (0.93-0.98), P = 0.003]. Retrospective study revealed low Lp(a) levels were associated with a significantly higher risk of depression (n = 670) [1.273 (1.007, 1.609), P = 0.044], anxiety (n = 1284) [1.231 (1.041, 1.456), P = 0.015] and major depression (n = 538) [1.364 (1.012,1.841), P = 0.042]. This study found there is a causal relationship between the number and longest period of depressive episodes or memory loss and Lp(a), while bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder were associated with a significant causal effect on reduced Lp(a) levels. Future studies should focus on whether a sustained decrease in Lp(a) levels could cause the development of mental disorders, and which target value is suitable for clinical practice.","Pan, Guanrui; Fu, Qingan; Xu, Yuan; Jiang, Long",Journal of affective disorders,2025,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Lipoprotein(a); Retrospective Studies; Genome-Wide Association Study; Male; Female; Depressive Disorder, Major; Middle Aged; Case-Control Studies; Mental Disorders; Bipolar Disorder; Adult; Biomarkers",Lipoprotein (a); Mendelian randomization study; Mental disorders; Retrospective study,"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China.; Department of Medical Big Data Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China.

UK Biobank,36513072,Exome-wide association analysis of CT imaging-derived hepatic fat in a medical biobank.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is common and highly heritable. Genetic studies of hepatic fat have not sufficiently addressed non-European and rare variants. In a medical biobank, we quantitate hepatic fat from clinical computed tomography (CT) scans via deep learning in 10,283 participants with whole-exome sequences available. We conduct exome-wide associations of single variants and rare predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) variants with CT-based hepatic fat and perform cross-modality replication in the UK Biobank (UKB) by linking whole-exome sequences to MRI-based hepatic fat. We confirm single variants previously associated with hepatic fat and identify several additional variants, including two (FGD5 H600Y and CITED2 S198_G199del) that replicated in UKB. A burden of rare pLOF variants in LMF2 is associated with increased hepatic fat and replicates in UKB. Quantitative phenotypes generated from clinical imaging studies and intersected with genomic data in medical biobanks have the potential to identify molecular pathways associated with human traits and disease.","Park, Joseph; MacLean, Matthew T; Lucas, Anastasia M; Torigian, Drew A; Schneider, Carolin V; Cherlin, Tess; Xiao, Brenda; Miller, Jason E; Bradford, Yuki; Judy, Renae L; Verma, Anurag; Damrauer, Scott M; Ritchie, Marylyn D; Witschey, Walter R; Rader, Daniel J",Cell reports.

UK Biobank,37880510,Personalised lung cancer risk stratification and lung cancer screening: do general practice electronic medical records have a role?,"In the United Kingdom (UK), cancer screening invitations are based on general practice (GP) registrations. We hypothesize that GP electronic medical records (EMR) can be utilised to calculate a lung cancer risk score with good accuracy/clinical utility. The development cohort was Secure Anonymised Information Linkage-SAIL (2.3 million GP EMR) and the validation cohort was UK Biobank-UKB (N = 211,597 with GP-EMR availability). Fast backward method was applied for variable selection and area under the curve (AUC) evaluated discrimination. Age 55-75 were included (SAIL: N = 574,196; UKB: N = 137,918). Six-year lung cancer incidence was 1.1% (6430) in SAIL and 0.48% (656) in UKB. The final model included 17/56 variables in SAIL for the EMR-derived score: age, sex, socioeconomic status, smoking status, family history, body mass index (BMI), BMI:smoking interaction, alcohol misuse, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, dementia, hypertension, painful condition, stroke, peripheral vascular disease and history of previous cancer and previous pneumonia.

UK Biobank,35197341,"Association of social isolation, loneliness and genetic risk with incidence of dementia: UK Biobank Cohort Study.","Social isolation and loneliness have been associated with increased risk of dementia, but it is not known whether this risk is modified or confounded by genetic risk of dementia. We used the prospective UK Biobank study with 155 070 participants (mean age 64.1 years), including self-reported social isolation and loneliness. Genetic risk was indicated using the polygenic risk score for Alzheimer's disease and the incident dementia ascertained using electronic health records. Overall, 8.6% of participants reported that they were socially isolated and 5.5% were lonely. During a mean follow-up of 8.8 years (1.36 million person years), 1444 (0.9% of the total sample) were diagnosed with dementia. Social isolation, but not loneliness, was associated with increased risk of dementia (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.90). There were no interaction effects between genetic risk and social isolation or between genetic risk and loneliness predicting incident dementia. Of the participants who were socially isolated and had high genetic risk, 4.4% (95% CI 3.4% to 5.5%) were estimated to developed dementia compared with 2.9% (95% CI 2.6% to 3.2%) of those who were not socially isolated but had high genetic risk. Comparable differences were also in those with intermediate and low genetic risk levels. Socially isolated individuals are at increased risk of dementia at all levels of genetic risk.","Elovainio, Marko; Lahti, Jari; Pirinen, Matti; Pulkki-Råback, Laura; Malmberg, Anni; Lipsanen, Jari; Virtanen, Marianna; Kivimäki, Mika; Hakulinen, Christian",BMJ open,2022,Biological Specimen Banks; Cohort Studies; Dementia; Humans; Incidence; Loneliness; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Social Isolation; United Kingdom,dementia; genetics; geriatric medicine; public health,"Department of Psychology and Logopedics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland marko.elovainio@helsinki.fi.; Research Program Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Psychology and Logopedics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki Institute of Life Sciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Helsinki Institute for Information Technology and Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Psychology and Logopedics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Research Centre of Child Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.; Department of Psychology and Logopedics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Psychology and Logopedics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; School of Educational Sciences and Psychology, University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland.; Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London, UK.; Department of Psychology and Logopedics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.",10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053936
UK Biobank,40196258,Longitudinal Analysis of Electronic Health Records Reveals Medical Conditions Associated with Subsequent Alzheimer's Disease Development.,"Several health conditions are known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aim to systematically identify medical conditions that are associated with subsequent development of AD by leveraging the growing resources of electronic health records (EHRs). This retrospective cohort study used de-identified EHRs from two independent databases (MarketScan and VUMC) with 153 million individuals to identify AD cases and age- and gender-matched controls. By tracking their EHRs over a 10-year window before AD diagnosis and comparing the EHRs between AD cases and controls, we identified medical conditions that occur more likely in those who later develop AD. We further assessed the genetic underpinnings of these conditions in relation to AD genetics using data from two large-scale biobanks (BioVU and UK Biobank, total N=450,000). We identified 43,508 AD cases and 419,455 matched controls in MarketScan, and 1,320 AD cases and 12,720 matched controls in VUMC. We detected 406 and 102 medical phenotypes that are significantly enriched among the future AD cases in MarketScan and VUMC databases, respectively. In both EHR databases, mental disorders and neurological disorders emerged as the top two most enriched clinical categories. More than 70 medical phenotypes are replicated in both EHR databases, which are dominated by mental disorders (e.g., depression), neurological disorders (e.g., sleep orders), circulatory system disorders (e.g. cerebral atherosclerosis) and endocrine/metabolic disorders (e.g., type 2 diabetes). We identified 19 phenotypes that are either associated with individual risk variants of AD or a polygenic risk score of AD. In this study, analysis of longitudinal EHRs from independent large-scale databases enables robust identification of health conditions associated with subsequent development of AD, highlighting potential opportunities of therapeutics and interventions to reduce AD risk.","Zhong, Xue; Jia, Gengjie; Yin, Zhijun; Cheng, Kerou; Rzhetsky, Andrey; Li, Bingshan; Cox, Nancy J",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025,,Alzheimer’s disease; electronic health records; longitudinal; risk factors,"Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.; Department of Medicine, Institute of Genomics and Systems Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.; Department of Human Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.; Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.",10.1101/2025.03.22.25324197
UK Biobank,35168089,Validation of UK Biobank data for mental health outcomes: A pilot study using secondary care electronic health records.,"UK Biobank (UKB) is widely employed to investigate mental health disorders and related exposures; however, its applicability and relevance in a clinical setting and the assumptions required have not been sufficiently and systematically investigated. Here, we present the first validation study using secondary care mental health data with linkage to UKB from Oxford - Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) focusing on comparison of demographic information, diagnostic outcome, medication record and cognitive test results, with missing data and the implied bias from both resources depicted. We applied a natural language processing model to extract information embedded in unstructured text from clinical notes and attachments. Using a contingency table we compared the demographic information recorded in UKB and CRIS. We calculated the positive predictive value (PPV, proportion of true positives cases detected) for mental health diagnosis and relevant medication. Amongst the cohort of 854 subjects, PPVs for any mental health diagnosis for dementia, depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia were 41.6%, and were 59.5%, 12.5%, 50.0% and 52.6%, respectively. Self-reported medication records in UKB had general PPV of 47.0%, with the prevalence of frequently prescribed medicines to each typical mental health disorder considerably different from the information provided by CRIS. UKB is highly multimodal, but with limited follow-up records, whereas CRIS offers a longitudinal high-resolution clinical picture with more than ten years of observations. The linkage of both datasets will reduce the self-report bias and synergistically augment diverse modalities into a unified resource to facilitate more robust research in mental health.","Li, Zhenpeng; Kormilitzin, Andrey; Fernandes, Marco; Vaci, Nemanja; Liu, Qiang; Newby, Danielle; Goodday, Sarah; Smith, Tanya; Nevado-Holgado, Alejo J; Winchester, Laura",International journal of medical informatics,2022,Biological Specimen Banks; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Mental Health; Pilot Projects; Secondary Care; United Kingdom,Data resource; Linkage studies; Mental health; Neuro-epidemiology; UK Biobank; Validation study,"Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7JX, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7JX, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7JX, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7JX, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7JX, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7JX, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7JX, UK; 4youandme, Seattle, WA 98121-1031, USA.; NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, Warneford Hospital, Warneford Lane, Oxford OX3 7JX, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7JX, UK.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7JX, UK.

However, several obstacles limit immediate analysis of the data: data files vary in format, may be very large, and have numerical codes for column names. ukbtools removes all the upfront data wrangling required to get a single dataset for statistical analysis. All associated data files are merged into a single dataset with descriptive column names. The package also provides tools to assist in quality control by exploring the primary demographics of subsets of participants; query of disease diagnoses for one or more individuals, and estimating disease frequency relative to a reference variable; and to retrieve genetic metadata. Having a dataset with meaningful variable names, a set of UKB-specific exploratory data analysis tools, disease query functions, and a set of helper functions to explore and write genetic metadata to file, will rapidly enable UKB users to undertake their research.","Hanscombe, Ken B; Coleman, Jonathan R I; Traylor, Matthew; Lewis, Cathryn M",PloS one,2019,Data Analysis; Database Management Systems; Datasets as Topic; Disease; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Metadata; United Kingdom,,"Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.",10.1371/journal.pone.0214311
UK Biobank,35986173,Understanding the comorbidity between posttraumatic stress severity and coronary artery disease using genome-wide information and electronic health records.,"The association between coronary artery disease (CAD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) contributes to the high morbidity and mortality observed for these conditions. To understand the dynamics underlying PTSD-CAD comorbidity, we investigated large-scale genome-wide association (GWA) statistics from the Million Veteran Program (MVP), the UK Biobank (UKB), the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, and the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium. We observed a genetic correlation of CAD with PTSD case-control and quantitative outcomes, ranging from 0.18 to 0.32. To investigate possible cause-effect relationships underlying these genetic correlations, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, observing a significant bidirectional relationship between CAD and PTSD symptom severity. Genetically-determined PCL-17 (PTSD 17-item Checklist) total score was associated with increased CAD risk (odds ratio = 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI = 1.01-1.06). Conversely, CAD genetic liability was associated with reduced PCL-17 total score (beta = -0.42; 95% CI = -0.04 to -0.81). Because of these opposite-direction associations, we conducted a pleiotropic meta-analysis to investigate loci with concordant vs. discordant effects on PCL-17 and CAD, observing that concordant-effect loci were enriched for molecular pathways related to platelet amyloid precursor protein (beta = 1.53, p = 2.97 × 10","Polimanti, Renato; Wendt, Frank R; Pathak, Gita A; Tylee, Daniel S; Tcheandjieu, Catherine; Hilliard, Austin T; Levey, Daniel F; Adhikari, Keyrun; Gaziano, J Michael; O'Donnell, Christopher J; Assimes, Themistocles L; Stein, Murray B; Gelernter, Joel",Molecular psychiatry,2022,"Humans; Coronary Artery Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Electronic Health Records; Comorbidity; Risk Factors; Genetic Predisposition to Disease",,"Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, West Haven, CT, USA. renato.polimanti@yale.edu.; VA CT Healthcare Center, West Haven, CT, USA. renato.polimanti@yale.edu.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, West Haven, CT, USA.; VA CT Healthcare Center, West Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, West Haven, CT, USA.; VA CT Healthcare Center, West Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, West Haven, CT, USA.; VA CT Healthcare Center, West Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; VA Palo Alto Healthcare System, Palo Alto, CA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, West Haven, CT, USA.; VA CT Healthcare Center, West Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, West Haven, CT, USA.; VA CT Healthcare Center, West Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Medicine, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Medicine, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; VA Palo Alto Healthcare System, Palo Alto, CA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.; VA San Diego Healthcare System, Psychiatry Service, San Diego, CA, USA.; Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, West Haven, CT, USA.; VA CT Healthcare Center, West Haven, CT, USA.; Departments of Genetics and of Neuroscience, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.",10.1038/s41380-022-01735-z
UK Biobank,39657951,PheWAS analysis on large-scale biobank data with PheTK.,"With the rapid growth of genetic data linked to electronic health record (EHR) data in huge cohorts, large-scale phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) have become powerful discovery tools in biomedical research. PheWAS is an analysis method to study phenotype associations utilizing longitudinal EHR data. Previous PheWAS packages were developed mostly with smaller datasets and with earlier PheWAS approaches. PheTK was designed to simplify analysis and efficiently handle biobank-scale data. PheTK uses multithreading and supports a full PheWAS workflow including extraction of data from OMOP databases and Hail matrix tables as well as PheWAS analysis for both phecode version 1.2 and phecodeX. Benchmarking results showed PheTK took 64% less time than the R PheWAS package to complete the same workflow. PheTK can be run locally or on cloud platforms such as the All of Us Researcher Workbench (All of Us) or the UK Biobank (UKB) Research Analysis Platform (RAP).

UK Biobank,35278270,Genetic and phenotypic profiling of supranormal ejection fraction reveals decreased survival and underdiagnosed heart failure.,"Individuals with supranormal left ventricular ejection fraction (snLVEF; LVEF >70%) have increased mortality. However, the genetic and phenotypic profile of snLVEF remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the relationship of both snLVEF genetic risk and phenotype with survival and underdiagnosed heart failure (HF). A snLVEF genetic risk score (GRS) was applied and cases of snLVEF were identified in 486 754 individuals across two population-based cohorts (BioMe Biobank and UK Biobank). The snLVEF GRS and phenotype were evaluated for association with survival, as well as HF diagnosis, markers, symptoms, and medications. Of 486 754 participants, the median age was 58 years, 20 069 (4.1%) died, and 10 088 (2.1%) had diagnosed HF. Both snLVEF GRS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.1 for top 10% vs. bottom 10% GRS; p = 0.002) and phenotype (HR 1.4; p = 0.003) were associated with increased all-cause mortality. Both snLVEF GRS and phenotype were associated with reduced HF diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 0.97 and OR 0.63, respectively; both p ≤0.002). However, the snLVEF GRS and phenotype were both associated with elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels (146 and 185 pg/ml increase, respectively; p <0.001), including 268 out of 455 (59%) individuals with snLVEF phenotype who had BNP >100 pg/ml. Among 476 666 participants without HF diagnoses, snLVEF GRS and phenotype were associated with increased HF symptoms (e.g. exertional dyspnoea OR 1.4 and OR 1.3; p <0.003) and HF medications (e.g. loop diuretic OR 1.2 and OR 1.03; p <0.02). Associations were consistent in hypertensive individuals without cardiac comorbidities.

Among these, 132 566 (32%) ever smoked regularly, and 904 (0.22%) had a SAH. Each additional SD of the smoking polygenic risk score was associated with 21% increased risk of smoking (odds ratio [OR], 1.21 [95% CI, 1.20-1.21];  These findings provide evidence for a causal link between smoking and the risk of SAH.","Acosta, Julián N; Szejko, Natalia; Both, Cameron P; Vanent, Kevin; Noche, Rommell B; Gill, Thomas M; Matouk, Charles C; Sheth, Kevin N; Gunel, Murat; Falcone, Guido J",Stroke,2021,"Adult; Aged; Databases, Factual; Electronic Health Records; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Middle Aged; Multifactorial Inheritance; Odds Ratio; Risk Assessment; Self Report; Smoking; Stroke; Subarachnoid Hemorrhage; Treatment Outcome; United Kingdom",genetic variation; hemorrhagic stroke; intracranial aneurysm; subarachnoid hemorrhage,"Division of Neurocritical Care and Emergency Neurology, Department of Neurology (J.N.A., N.S., C.P.B., K.V., R.B.N., K.N.S., G.J.F.), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.; Division of Neurocritical Care and Emergency Neurology, Department of Neurology (J.N.A., N.S., C.P.B., K.V., R.B.N., K.N.S., G.J.F.), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.; Department of Neurology (N.S.), Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.; Department of Bioethics (N.S.), Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.; Division of Neurocritical Care and Emergency Neurology, Department of Neurology (J.N.A., N.S., C.P.B., K.V., R.B.N., K.N.S., G.J.F.), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.; Division of Neurocritical Care and Emergency Neurology, Department of Neurology (J.N.A., N.S., C.P.B., K.V., R.B.N., K.N.S., G.J.F.), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.; Division of Neurocritical Care and Emergency Neurology, Department of Neurology (J.N.A., N.S., C.P.B., K.V., R.B.N., K.N.S., G.J.F.), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.; Department of Internal Medicine (T.M.G.), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.; Department of Neurosurgery (C.C.M.), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.; Division of Neurocritical Care and Emergency Neurology, Department of Neurology (J.N.A., N.S., C.P.B., K.V., R.B.N., K.N.S., G.J.F.), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.; Division of Neurocritical Care and Emergency Neurology, Department of Neurology (J.N.A., N.S., C.P.B., K.V., R.B.N., K.N.S., G.J.F.), Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.",10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.031622
UK Biobank,38100737,Phenotypes and rates of cancer-relevant symptoms and tests in the year before cancer diagnosis in UK Biobank and CPRD Gold.,"Early diagnosis of cancer relies on accurate assessment of cancer risk in patients presenting with symptoms, when screening is not appropriate. But recorded symptoms in cancer patients pre-diagnosis may vary between different sources of electronic health records (EHRs), either genuinely or due to differential completeness of symptom recording. To assess possible differences, we analysed primary care EHRs in the year pre-diagnosis of cancer in UK Biobank and Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) populations linked to cancer registry data. We developed harmonised phenotypes in Read v2 and CTV3 coding systems for 21 symptoms and eight blood tests relevant to cancer diagnosis. Among 22,601 CPRD and 11,594 UK Biobank cancer patients, 54% and 36%, respectively, had at least one consultation for possible cancer symptoms recorded in the year before their diagnosis. Adjusted comparisons between datasets were made using multivariable Poisson models, comparing rates of symptoms/tests in CPRD against expected rates if cancer site-age-sex-deprivation associations were the same as in UK Biobank. UK Biobank cancer patients compared with those in CPRD had lower rates of consultation for possible cancer symptoms [RR: 0.61 (0.59-0.63)], and lower rates for any primary care consultation [RR: 0.86 (95%CI 0.85-0.87)]. Differences were larger for 'non-alarm' symptoms [RR: 0.54 (0.52-0.56)], and smaller for 'alarm' symptoms [RR: 0.80 (0.76-0.84)] and blood tests [RR: 0.93 (0.90-0.95)]. In the CPRD cohort, approximately representative of the UK population, half of cancer patients had recorded symptoms in the year before diagnosis. The frequency of non-specific presenting symptoms recorded in the year pre-diagnosis of cancer was substantially lower among UK Biobank participants. The degree to which results based on highly selected biobank cohorts are generalisable needs to be examined in disease-specific contexts.","Barclay, Matthew; Renzi, Cristina; Antoniou, Antonis; Denaxas, Spiros; Harrison, Hannah; Ip, Samantha; Pashayan, Nora; Torralbo, Ana; Usher-Smith, Juliet; Wood, Angela; Lyratzopoulos, Georgios",PLOS digital health,2023,,,"Department of Behavioural Science and Health, Institute of Epidemiology and Healthcare, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Behavioural Science and Health, Institute of Epidemiology and Healthcare, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Faculty of Medicine, University Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.; Department of Public Health and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Public Health and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; Department of Public Health and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; Victor Phillip Dahdaleh Heart and Lung Research Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; Department of Applied Health Research, Institute of Epidemiology and Healthcare, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Public Health and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; Department of Public Health and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; Victor Phillip Dahdaleh Heart and Lung Research Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; National Institute for Health and Care Research Blood and Transplant Research Unit in Donor Health and Behaviour, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; Health Data Research UK Cambridge, Wellcome Genome Campus and University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; Cambridge Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; Department of Behavioural Science and Health, Institute of Epidemiology and Healthcare, University College London, London, United Kingdom.",10.1371/journal.pdig.0000383
UK Biobank,35047837,Genome-wide survey of parent-of-origin-specific associations across clinical traits derived from electronic health records.,"Parent-of-origin (PoO) effects refer to the differential phenotypic impacts of genetic variants dependent on their parental inheritance due to imprinting. While PoO effects can influence complex traits, they may be poorly captured by models that do not differentiate the parental origin of the variant. The aim of this study was to conduct a genome-wide screen for PoO effects on a broad range of clinical traits derived from electronic health records (EHR) in the DiscovEHR study enriched with familial relationships. Using pairwise kinship estimates from genetic data and demographic data, we identified 22,051 offspring among 134,049 individuals in the DiscovEHR study. PoO of ~9 million variants was assigned in the offspring by comparing offspring and parental genotypes and haplotypes. We then performed genome-wide PoO association analyses across 154 quantitative and 611 binary traits extracted from EHR.

UK Biobank,34140684,A unified framework identifies new links between plasma lipids and diseases from electronic medical records across large-scale cohorts.,"Plasma lipids are known heritable risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but increasing evidence also supports shared genetics with diseases of other organ systems. We devised a comprehensive three-phase framework to identify new lipid-associated genes and study the relationships among lipids, genotypes, gene expression and hundreds of complex human diseases from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (347 traits) and the UK Biobank (549 traits). Aside from 67 new lipid-associated genes with strong replication, we found evidence for pleiotropic SNPs/genes between lipids and diseases across the phenome. These include discordant pleiotropy in the HLA region between lipids and multiple sclerosis and putative causal paths between triglycerides and gout, among several others. Our findings give insights into the genetic basis of the relationship between plasma lipids and diseases on a phenome-wide scale and can provide context for future prevention and treatment strategies.","Veturi, Yogasudha; Lucas, Anastasia; Bradford, Yuki; Hui, Daniel; Dudek, Scott; Theusch, Elizabeth; Verma, Anurag; Miller, Jason E; Kullo, Iftikhar; Hakonarson, Hakon; Sleiman, Patrick; Schaid, Daniel; Stein, Charles M; Edwards, Digna R Velez; Feng, QiPing; Wei, Wei-Qi; Medina, Marisa W; Krauss, Ronald M; Hoffmann, Thomas J; Risch, Neil; Voight, Benjamin F; Rader, Daniel J; Ritchie, Marylyn D",Nature genetics,2021,"Alleles; Biological Specimen Banks; Biomarkers; Disease Susceptibility; Electronic Health Records; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Lipids; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Public Health Surveillance; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; United Kingdom",,"Department of Genetics and Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Genetics and Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Genetics and Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Genetics and Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Genetics and Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, Oakland, CA, USA.; Department of Genetics and Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Genetics and Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Center for Applied Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Center for Applied Genomics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics in School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.; Division of Quantitative Science, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics in School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, Oakland, CA, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, Oakland, CA, USA.; Institute for Human Genetics, and Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Institute for Human Genetics, and Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.; Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Institute of Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Genetics and Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Genetics and Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. marylyn@pennmedicine.upenn.edu.",10.1038/s41588-021-00879-y

Cohort study including observational, genetic, and Mendelian randomisation analyses. 22 centres across England, Scotland, and Wales in UK Biobank (2006-10), with replication in a national Finnish cohort (FinnGen). 463 060 participants in the UK Biobank were successfully genotyped for a genetic variant (rs887829) that is strongly associated with Gilbert syndrome and 438 056 participants had measured bilirubin concentrations with linked electronic health record data coded using the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Replication analyses were performed in FinnGen (n=429 209) with linked electronic health record data. Odds ratios for the association between serum bilirubin concentrations, rs887829-T homozygosity (the risk genotype for Gilbert syndrome), genetically predicted bilirubin using rs887829-T allele carriage alone, and a wide range of health outcomes recorded in primary and secondary care. 46 189 participants in UK Biobank (about 10%) were homozygous for rs887829-T defining them as having the genotype characterising Gilbert syndrome. However, only 1701 (3%) of this group had a coded diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome. Variation at this locus explained 37.1% of all variation in measured serum bilirubin. In the observational analyses, higher bilirubin concentrations had strong inverse associations with a wide range of outcomes including overall health status, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction, and cholesterol measures. These associations were not identified in people with the Gilbert genotype. We identified associations with genetically predicted bilirubin concentrations and biliary and liver pathology (eg, odds ratio for cholelithiasis 1.16 (95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.20); P=5.7×10 Only 3% of participants who are homozygous for rs887829-T have a recorded diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome. Carriers of this genotype have modest increases in the odds of developing biliary pathology and pityriasis rosea. Evidence from the analyses of genetic data suggests that bilirubin has no likely causal role in protection from cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other key healthcare outcomes and therefore represents a poor target for therapeutic intervention for these outcomes.","Hamilton, Fergus W; Abeysekera, Kwm; Hamilton, Willie; Timpson, Nicholas J",BMJ medicine,2023,,gastrointestinal diseases; genetics; medicine,"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Bristol, UK.; Infection Science, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Bristol, UK.; Department of Liver Medicine, Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol, UK.; Medical School, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Bristol, UK.",10.1136/bmjmed-2022-000467

UK Biobank,39662181,"Refinement of post-COVID condition core symptoms, subtypes, determinants, and health impacts: a cohort study integrating real-world data and patient-reported outcomes.","Post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) affects millions of people, and is an essential component of the long-term impact of COVID-19 during the post-pandemic era. Yet, consensus on clinical case definition and core components of PCC remains lacking, affecting our ability to inform research and evidence-based management. Our study aims 1) to identify the most specific symptoms for PCC, and identify clinical subtypes; 2) to evaluate both virus- and host-related determinants of PCC, and 3) assess the impact of PCC on physical and mental health. We studied participants from UK Biobank who completed a health and wellbeing survey between June and September 2022. Participants reported the current conditions of the presence, duration, and functional limitations of 45 symptoms, using an online questionnaire designed specifically for COVID-19 research. SARS-CoV-2 infection status and disease history were obtained through linkage to surveillance data and electronic medical records, respectively. Participants reporting symptoms within 30 days after infection (acute phase) were excluded. The most specific PCC symptoms were defined using two criteria: statistical significance (P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction) and clinical relevance (absolute risk increase > 5%). Propensity score weighting was used to control for confounding. Subtypes of PCC were then defined based on the specific symptoms among the COVID-19 infected individuals. A multivariable regression was used to study pathogen- and host-related risk factors for PCC, and its impact on 13 physical and 4 mental health patient-reported functional outcomes. 172,303 participants (mean age 68.9, 57.4% female) were included in the analysis, of whom 43,395 had PCR-confirmed COVID-19. We identified 10 most specific symptoms and classified four PCC subtypes: ENT subtype (30.1%), characterized by alterations in smell, taste, and hearing loss; cardiopulmonary subtype (10.4%), characterized by shortness of breath, postural tachycardia, chest tightness, and chest pressure; neurological subtype (23.5%), characterized by brain fog and difficulty speaking; and general fatigue subtype (38.0%), characterized by mild fatigue. A higher PCC risk was observed for patients with Wild-type variant, multiple infections, and severe acute COVID-19 illness, consistently across the four PCC subtypes. In addition, a range of factors, including socioeconomic deprivation, higher BMI, unhealthy lifestyle, and multiple chronic health conditions, were associated with increased PCC risk, except for age and sex. Conversely, vaccination was associated with a largely reduced PCC risk, particularly for the cardiopulmonary subtypes. Individuals with PCC experienced a much worse physical and mental health. Specifically, the cardiopulmonary subtype had the most pronounced adverse impact on function impairments, followed by neurological, mild fatigue, and ENT subtype. The most affected functions included the ability to concentrate, participate in day-to-day work, and emotional vulnerability to health problems. PCC can be categorized into four distinct subtypes based on ten core symptoms. These subtypes appeared to share a majority of pathogen and host-related risk factors, but their impact on health varied markedly by subtype. Our findings could help refine current guidelines for precise PCC diagnosis and progression, enhance the identification of PCC subgroups for targeted research, and inform evidence-based policy making to tackle this new and debilitating condition.

In this study, we utilized a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach, incorporating a polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from a wide array of genomic variants, to systematically investigate phenotypes associated with genetic predisposition to HNSCC. Furthermore, we validated our findings across heterogeneous cohorts, enhancing the robustness and generalizability of our results. We derived PRSs for HNSCC and its subgroups, oropharyngeal cancer and oral cancer, using large-scale genome-wide association study summary statistics from the Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology Network. We conducted a comprehensive investigation, leveraging genotyping data and electronic health records from 308,492 individuals in the UK Biobank and 38,401 individuals in the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB), and subsequently performed PheWAS to elucidate the associations between PRS and a wide spectrum of phenotypes. We revealed the HNSCC PRS showed significant association with phenotypes related to tobacco use disorder (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.05-1.08; P = 3.50 × 10 The study demonstrated the potential of PRS-based PheWAS in revealing associations between genetic risk factors for HNSCC and various phenotypic traits.

UK Biobank,35139346,Accounting for age of onset and family history improves power in genome-wide association studies.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revolutionized human genetics, allowing researchers to identify thousands of disease-related genes and possible drug targets. However, case-control status does not account for the fact that not all controls may have lived through their period of risk for the disorder of interest. This can be quantified by examining the age-of-onset distribution and the age of the controls or the age of onset for cases. The age-of-onset distribution may also depend on information such as sex and birth year. In addition, family history is not routinely included in the assessment of control status. Here, we present LT-FH++, an extension of the liability threshold model conditioned on family history (LT-FH), which jointly accounts for age of onset and sex as well as family history. Using simulations, we show that, when family history and the age-of-onset distribution are available, the proposed approach yields statistically significant power gains over LT-FH and large power gains over genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX). We applied our method to four psychiatric disorders available in the iPSYCH data and to mortality in the UK Biobank and found 20 genome-wide significant associations with LT-FH++, compared to ten for LT-FH and eight for a standard case-control GWAS. As more genetic data with linked electronic health records become available to researchers, we expect methods that account for additional health information, such as LT-FH++, to become even more beneficial.","Pedersen, Emil M; Agerbo, Esben; Plana-Ripoll, Oleguer; Grove, Jakob; Dreier, Julie W; Musliner, Katherine L; Bækvad-Hansen, Marie; Athanasiadis, Georgios; Schork, Andrew; Bybjerg-Grauholm, Jonas; Hougaard, David M; Werge, Thomas; Nordentoft, Merete; Mors, Ole; Dalsgaard, Søren; Christensen, Jakob; Børglum, Anders D; Mortensen, Preben B; McGrath, John J; Privé, Florian; Vilhjálmsson, Bjarni J",American journal of human genetics,2022,Age of Onset; Case-Control Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Medical History Taking,ADHD; LT-FH; LT-FH++; UKBB; age-of-onset; family history; genome-wide association study; iPSYCH; liability threshold model; mortality,"National Centre for Register-Based Research, Aarhus University, 8210 Aarhus, Denmark; Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research, 8210 Aarhus, Denmark.

UK Biobank,38509467,Implementation and external validation of the Cambridge Multimorbidity Score in the UK Biobank cohort.,"Patients with multiple conditions present a growing challenge for healthcare provision. Measures of multimorbidity may support clinical management, healthcare resource allocation and accounting for the health of participants in purpose-designed cohorts. The recently developed Cambridge Multimorbidity scores (CMS) have the potential to achieve these aims using primary care records, however, they have not yet been validated outside of their development cohort. The CMS, developed in the Clinical Research Practice Dataset (CPRD), were validated in UK Biobank participants whose data is not available in CPRD (the cohort used for CMS development) with available primary care records (n = 111,898). This required mapping of the 37 pre-existing conditions used in the CMS to the coding frameworks used by UK Biobank data providers. We used calibration plots and measures of discrimination to validate the CMS for two of the three outcomes used in the development study (death and primary care consultation rate) and explored variation by age and sex. We also examined the predictive ability of the CMS for the outcome of cancer diagnosis. The results were compared to an unweighted count score of the 37 pre-existing conditions. For all three outcomes considered, the CMS were poorly calibrated in UK Biobank. We observed a similar discriminative ability for the outcome of primary care consultation rate to that reported in the development study (C-index: 0.67 (95%CI:0.66-0.68) for both, 5-year follow-up); however, we report lower discrimination for the outcome of death than the development study (0.69 (0.68-0.70) and 0.89 (0.88-0.90) respectively). Discrimination for cancer diagnosis was adequate (0.64 (0.63-0.65)). The CMS performs favourably to the unweighted count score for death, but not for the outcomes of primary care consultation rate or cancer diagnosis. In the UK Biobank, CMS discriminates reasonably for the outcomes of death, primary care consultation rate and cancer diagnosis and may be a valuable resource for clinicians, public health professionals and data scientists. However, recalibration will be required to make accurate predictions when cohort composition and risk levels differ substantially from the development cohort.

UK Biobank,38410487,PheWAS analysis on large-scale biobank data with PheTK.,"With the rapid growth of genetic data linked to electronic health record data in huge cohorts, large-scale phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), have become powerful discovery tools in biomedical research. PheWAS is an analysis method to study phenotype associations utilizing longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data. Previous PheWAS packages were developed mostly in the days of smaller biobanks and with earlier PheWAS approaches. PheTK was designed to simplify analysis and efficiently handle biobank-scale data. PheTK uses multithreading and supports a full PheWAS workflow including extraction of data from OMOP databases and Hail matrix tables as well as PheWAS analysis for both phecode version 1.2 and phecodeX. Benchmarking results showed PheTK took 64% less time than the R PheWAS package to complete the same workflow.

UK Biobank,37247657,Lifetime risk and genetic predisposition to post-traumatic OA of the knee in the UK Biobank.,"Acute knee injury is associated with post-traumatic OA (PTOA). Very little is known about the genome-wide associations of PTOA when compared with idiopathic OA (iOA). Our objective was to describe the development of knee OA after a knee injury and its genetic associations in UK Biobank (UKB). Clinically significant structural knee injuries in those ≤50 years were identified from electronic health records and self-reported data in 502,409 UKB participants. Time-to-first knee osteoarthritis (OA) code was compared in injured cases and age-/sex-matched non-injured controls using Cox Proportional Hazards models. A time-to-OA genome-wide association study (GWAS) sought evidence for PTOA risk variants 6 months to 20 years following injury. Evidence for associations of two iOA polygenic risk scores (PRS) was sought. Of 4233 knee injury cases, 1896 (44.8%) were female (mean age at injury 34.1 years [SD 10.4]). Over a median of 30.2 (IQR 19.5-45.4) years, 1096 (25.9%) of injured cases developed knee OA. The overall hazards ratio (HR) for knee OA after injury was 1.81 (1.70,1.93), P = 8.9 × 10 Increasing age at injury and female sex appear to be associated with future development of PTOA in UKB, the risk of which was greatest in the 5 years after injury. Further international efforts towards a better-powered meta-analysis will definitively elucidate genetic similarities and differences of PTOA and iOA.","Hollis, B; Chatzigeorgiou, C; Southam, L; Hatzikotoulas, K; Kluzek, S; Williams, A; Zeggini, E; Jostins-Dean, L; Watt, F E",Osteoarthritis and cartilage,2023,"Humans; Female; Adult; Male; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Biological Specimen Banks; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Knee Injuries; United Kingdom",Genetic; Injury; Knee; Osteoarthritis; Post-traumatic; Risk,"Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Institute of Translational Genomics, Helmholtz, Munich, Germany.; Institute of Translational Genomics, Helmholtz, Munich, Germany.; Centre for Sport, Exercise and Osteoarthritis Research Versus Arthritis, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.; Fortius Clinic, London, United Kingdom.; Institute of Translational Genomics, Helmholtz, Munich, Germany.; Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom; Centre for Osteoarthritis Pathogenesis Versus Arthritis, Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.

The study included 11 309 patients with type 2 diabetes at baseline from the UK Biobank cohort. SES was grouped based on income, education, and employment status by using latent class analysis. Microvascular complications of diabetes were identified through electronic health records. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for microvascular complications across SES groups. Mediation analysis was applied to explore potential mediators in these associations. During a median follow-up of 12.2 years, 262, 764, and 1017 participants in the high, medium, and low SES groups were diagnosed with microvascular complications. Compared to participants with high SES, those with low SES had a HR of 1.75 (95% CI: 1.53, 2.01) for total microvascular complications, a HR of 2.11 (95% CI: 1.74, 2.55) for nephropathy, a HR of 1.40 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.72) for retinopathy, and a HR of 1.79 (95% CI: 1.32, 2.43) for neuropathy. Mediation analysis indicated that alcohol consumption, body mass index, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glycated hemoglobin mediated the association between SES and microvascular complications, with mediation percentages of 1.3%, 12.2%, 4.4%, 10.9%, and 10.8%, respectively. Lower SES may be associated with a higher risk of diabetic microvascular complications, and obesity-related indicators and glycated hemoglobin may play important mediating roles in the association.","Li, Ying; You, Qiqi; Fan, Menglin; Wei, Lingqi; Zeng, Jingjing; Chen, Bo; Wang, Jie; Xu, Shaoyong",Journal of diabetes,2025,"Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Male; Middle Aged; United Kingdom; Risk Factors; Social Class; Biological Specimen Banks; Diabetic Angiopathies; Aged; Cohort Studies; Follow-Up Studies; Diabetic Nephropathies; UK Biobank",cohort; mediation analysis; microvascular complication; socioeconomic status; type 2 diabetes,"College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.; Department of Endocrinology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, Hubei, China.; Center for Clinical Evidence-Based and Translational Medicine, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, Hubei, China.; Center for Clinical Evidence-Based and Translational Medicine, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, Hubei, China.; College of Medicine, Wuhan University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.; Department of Endocrinology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, Hubei, China.; Center for Clinical Evidence-Based and Translational Medicine, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, Hubei, China.; Center for Clinical Evidence-Based and Translational Medicine, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, Hubei, China.; Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics, Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei, China.; Department of Endocrinology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, Hubei, China.",10.1111/1753-0407.70079

UK Biobank,37547012,"PheMIME: An Interactive Web App and Knowledge Base for Phenome-Wide, Multi-Institutional Multimorbidity Analysis.","Multimorbidity, characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of multiple diseases in an individual, is an increasing global health concern, posing substantial challenges to healthcare systems. Comprehensive understanding of disease-disease interactions and intrinsic mechanisms behind multimorbidity can offer opportunities for innovative prevention strategies, targeted interventions, and personalized treatments. Yet, there exist limited tools and datasets that characterize multimorbidity patterns across different populations. To bridge this gap, we used large-scale electronic health record (EHR) systems to develop the Phenome-wide Multi-Institutional Multimorbidity Explorer (PheMIME), which facilitates research in exploring and comparing multimorbidity patterns among multiple institutions, potentially leading to the discovery of novel and robust disease associations and patterns that are interoperable across different systems and organizations. PheMIME integrates summary statistics from phenome-wide analyses of disease multimorbidities. These are currently derived from three major institutions: Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Mass General Brigham, and the UK Biobank. PheMIME offers interactive exploration of multimorbidity through multi-faceted visualization. Incorporating an enhanced version of associationSubgraphs, PheMIME enables dynamic analysis and inference of disease clusters, promoting the discovery of multimorbidity patterns. Once a disease of interest is selected, the tool generates interactive visualizations and tables that users can delve into multimorbidities or multimorbidity networks within a single system or compare across multiple systems. The utility of PheMIME is demonstrated through a case study on schizophrenia. The PheMIME knowledge base and web application are accessible at https://prod.tbilab.org/PheMIME/. A comprehensive tutorial, including a use-case example, is available at https://prod.tbilab.org/PheMIME_supplementary_materials/.

UK Biobank,32589924,A Fast and Accurate Method for Genome-Wide Time-to-Event Data Analysis and Its Application to UK Biobank.,"With increasing biobanking efforts connecting electronic health records and national registries to germline genetics, the time-to-event data analysis has attracted increasing attention in the genetics studies of human diseases. In time-to-event data analysis, the Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression model is one of the most used approaches. However, existing methods and tools are not scalable when analyzing a large biobank with hundreds of thousands of samples and endpoints, and they are not accurate when testing low-frequency and rare variants. Here, we propose a scalable and accurate method, SPACox (a saddlepoint approximation implementation based on the Cox PH regression model), that is applicable for genome-wide scale time-to-event data analysis. SPACox requires fitting a Cox PH regression model only once across the genome-wide analysis and then uses a saddlepoint approximation (SPA) to calibrate the test statistics. Simulation studies show that SPACox is 76-252 times faster than other existing alternatives, such as gwasurvivr, 185-511 times faster than the standard Wald test, and more than 6,000 times faster than the Firth correction and can control type I error rates at the genome-wide significance level regardless of minor allele frequencies. Through the analysis of UK Biobank inpatient data of 282,871 white British European ancestry samples, we show that SPACox can efficiently analyze large sample sizes and accurately control type I error rates. We identified 611 loci associated with time-to-event phenotypes of 12 common diseases, of which 38 loci would be missed within a logistic regression framework with a binary phenotype defined as event occurrence status during the follow-up period.","Bi, Wenjian; Fritsche, Lars G; Mukherjee, Bhramar; Kim, Sehee; Lee, Seunggeun",American journal of human genetics,2020,Biological Specimen Banks; Case-Control Studies; Data Analysis; Gene Frequency; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Logistic Models; Phenotype; Proportional Hazards Models; Sample Size; United Kingdom; White People,Cox proportional hazards regression model; GWAS; PheWAS; UK Biobank; electronic health record; saddlepoint approximation; survival analysis; time-to-event data,"Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Asan Medical Center, Seoul 05505, Republic of Korea.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Graduate School of Data Science, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea.

UK Biobank,36109502,Are infections associated with cognitive decline and neuroimaging outcomes? A historical cohort study using data from the UK Biobank study linked to electronic health records.,"While there is growing evidence of associations between infections and dementia risk, associations with cognitive impairment and potential structural correlates of cognitive decline remain underexplored. Here we aimed to investigate the presence and nature of any associations between common infections, cognitive decline and neuroimaging parameters. The UK Biobank is a large volunteer cohort (over 500,000 participants recruited aged 40-69) with linkage to primary and secondary care records. Using linear mixed effects models, we compared participants with and without a history of infections for changes in cognitive function during follow-up. Linear regression models were used to investigate the association of infections with hippocampal and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume. 16,728 participants (median age 56.0 years [IQR 50.0-61.0]; 51.3% women) had baseline and follow-up cognitive measures. We found no evidence of an association between the presence of infection diagnoses and cognitive decline for mean correct response time (slope difference [infections versus no infections] = 0.40 ms, 95% CI: -0.17-0.96 per year), visual memory (slope difference 0.0004 log errors per year, 95% CI: -0.003-0.004, fluid intelligence (slope difference 0.007, 95% CI: -0.010-0.023) and prospective memory (OR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.68-1.14). No evidence of an association was found between infection site, setting or frequency and cognitive decline except for small associations on the visual memory test. We found no association between infections and hippocampal or WMH volume. Limitations of our study include selection bias, potential practice effects and the relatively young age of our cohort. Our findings do not support a major role for common midlife infections in contributing to cognitive decline for this cohort. Further research is warranted in individuals with more severe infections, for infections occurring later in life.","Muzambi, Rutendo; Bhaskaran, Krishnan; Rentsch, Christopher T; Smeeth, Liam; Brayne, Carol; Garfield, Victoria; Williams, Dylan M; Chaturvedi, Nish; Warren-Gash, Charlotte",Translational psychiatry,2022,"Biological Specimen Banks; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cohort Studies; Electronic Health Records; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory, Episodic; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; United Kingdom",,"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, WC1E 7HT, UK.

UK Biobank,29844141,Interdisciplinary Models for Research and Clinical Endeavors in Genomic Medicine: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,"The completion of the Human Genome Project has unleashed a wealth of human genomics information, but it remains unclear how best to implement this information for the benefit of patients. The standard approach of biomedical research, with researchers pursuing advances in knowledge in the laboratory and, separately, clinicians translating research findings into the clinic as much as decades later, will need to give way to new interdisciplinary models for research in genomic medicine. These models should include scientists and clinicians actively working as teams to study patients and populations recruited in clinical settings and communities to make genomics discoveries-through the combined efforts of data scientists, clinical researchers, epidemiologists, and basic scientists-and to rapidly apply these discoveries in the clinic for the prediction, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. The highly publicized US Precision Medicine Initiative, also known as All of Us, is a large-scale program funded by the US National Institutes of Health that will energize these efforts, but several ongoing studies such as the UK Biobank Initiative; the Million Veteran Program; the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network; the Kaiser Permanente Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health; and the DiscovEHR collaboration are already providing exemplary models of this kind of interdisciplinary work.

To confirm accurate assignment of weight trajectories, we manually reviewed weight trajectory plots for 100 random individuals. We then did a hypothesis-free phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to identify diseases associated with each weight trajectory. Next, we estimated the single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability (h We found high concordance between manually assigned weight trajectories and those assigned by the algorithm (accuracy ≥98%).

UK Biobank,35105585,Development of an algorithm to classify primary care electronic health records of alcohol consumption: experience using data linkage from UK Biobank and primary care electronic health data sources.,"Develop a novel algorithm to categorise alcohol consumption using primary care electronic health records (EHRs) and asses its reliability by comparing this classification with self-reported alcohol consumption data obtained from the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort. Cross-sectional study. The UKB, a population-based cohort with participants aged between 40 and 69 years recruited across the UK between 2006 and 2010. UKB participants from Scotland with linked primary care data. Create a rule-based multiclass algorithm to classify alcohol consumption reported by Scottish UKB participants and compare it with their classification using data present in primary care EHRs based on Read Codes. We evaluated agreement metrics (simple agreement and kappa statistic). Among the Scottish UKB participants, 18 838 (69%) had at least one Read Code related to alcohol consumption and were used in the classification. The agreement of alcohol consumption categories between UKB and primary care data, including assessments within 5 years was 59.6%, and kappa was 0.23 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.24). Differences in classification between the two sources were statistically significant (p<0.001); More individuals were classified as 'sensible drinkers' and in lower alcohol consumption levels in primary care records compared with the UKB. Agreement improved slightly when using only numerical values (k=0.29; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.31) and decreased when using qualitative descriptors only (k=0.18;95% CI 0.16 to 0.20). Our algorithm classifies alcohol consumption recorded in Primary Care EHRs into discrete meaningful categories. These results suggest that alcohol consumption may be underestimated in primary care EHRs. Using numerical values (alcohol units) may improve classification when compared with qualitative descriptors.","Fraile-Navarro, David; Azcoaga-Lorenzo, Amaya; Agrawal, Utkarsh; Jani, Bhautesh; Fagbamigbe, Adeniyi; Currie, Dorothy; Baldacchino, Alexander; Sullivan, Frank",BMJ open,2022,Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Algorithms; Biological Specimen Banks; Cross-Sectional Studies; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Middle Aged; Primary Health Care; Reproducibility of Results; Scotland,health informatics; primary care; public health,"Population and Behavioural Science Division, School of Medicine Medical & Biological Sciences, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK.; Faculty of Medicine, Health and Human Sciences, Centre for Health Informatics, Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Population and Behavioural Science Division, School of Medicine Medical & Biological Sciences, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK aal22@st-andrews.ac.uk.; Population and Behavioural Science Division, School of Medicine Medical & Biological Sciences, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK.; General Practice and Primary Care, Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.; Population and Behavioural Science Division, School of Medicine Medical & Biological Sciences, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK.; Population and Behavioural Science Division, School of Medicine Medical & Biological Sciences, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK.; Population and Behavioural Science Division, School of Medicine Medical & Biological Sciences, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK.; Population and Behavioural Science Division, School of Medicine Medical & Biological Sciences, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK.",10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054376
UK Biobank,33017352,A Genome-wide Association Study for Concussion Risk.,"This study aimed to screen the entire genome for genetic markers associated with risk for concussion. A genome-wide association analyses was performed using data from the Kaiser Permanente Research Bank and the UK Biobank. Concussion cases were identified based on electronic health records from the Kaiser Permanente Research Bank and the UK Biobank from individuals of European ancestry. Genome-wide association analyses from both cohorts were tested for concussion using a logistic regression model adjusting for sex, height, weight, and race/ethnicity using allele counts for single nucleotide polymorphisms. Previously identified genes within the literature were also tested for association with concussion. There were a total of 4064 cases of concussion and 291,472 controls within the databases, with two single nucleotide polymorphisms demonstrating a genome-wide significant association with concussion. The first polymorphism, rs144663795 (P = 9.7 × 10-11; OR = 2.91 per allele copy), is located within the intron of SPATA5. Strong, deleterious mutations in SPATA5 cause intellectual disability, hearing loss, and vision loss. The second polymorphism, rs117985931 (P = 3.97 × 10-9; OR = 3.59 per allele copy), is located within PLXNA4. PLXNA4 plays a key role is axon outgrowth during neural development, and DNA variants in PLXNA4 are associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease. Previous investigations have identified five candidate genes that may be associated with concussion, but none showed a significant association in the current model (P < 0.05). Two genetic markers were identified as potential risk factors for concussion and deserve further validation and investigation of molecular mechanisms.","Kim, Stuart K; Roche, Megan D; Fredericson, Michael; Dragoo, Jason L; Horton, Brandon H; Avins, Andy L; Belanger, Heather G; Ioannidis, John P A; Abrams, Geoffrey D",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2021,"ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities; Alleles; Body Height; Body Weight; Brain Concussion; Databases, Factual; Female; Genetic Markers; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Mutation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, Cell Surface; Risk Factors; Sex Factors",,"Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University Medical School, Stanford, CA.; Department Orthopaedic Surgery, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA.; Department Orthopaedic Surgery, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA.; UCHealth Steadman Hawkins Clinic Denver-Surgery Center, Englewood, CO.; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA.; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA.; Department Orthopaedic Surgery, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA.",10.1249/MSS.0000000000002529
UK Biobank,40288454,"Loneliness and social isolation, mediating lifestyle factors, and incidence of COPD: A prospective cohort study.","Limited information exists regarding the associations and pathways of loneliness and social isolation with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Our goal was to investigate the associations of loneliness and social isolation with COPD, as well as to analyze how lifestyle factors may play a role in mediating these effects. In the UK Biobank, 293,864 participants were included in this study. The study assessed five lifestyle factors: physical activity, eating habits, smoking, alcohol consumption, and body mass index (BMI). Incident COPD was detected through algorithms based on electronic health records. We used Cox proportional models to explore the association. Cause mediation analyses were applied to estimate the effect of various lifestyle factors. In the fully adjusted model, the lonely participants had a greater risk of developing COPD (HR: 1.31; 95 % CI: 1.20-1.43) compared with those participants without loneliness. Similarly, the HR of social isolation on incident COPD was 1.39 (95 % CI: 1.30-1.48) after adjusting for potential confounders. Current smokers (21.9 %), unhealthy dietary characteristics (4.8 %), BMI (4.0 %), unhealthy drinking habits (1.4 %), and physical activity (0.7 %) explained 32.8 % of the association between loneliness and COPD. Likewise, current smokers, physical activity, and unhealthy drinking habit mediated 46.1 %, 4.7 %, and 4.2 % of the effect of social isolation on incident COPD. Despite extensive adjustment for potential confounders and several sensitivity analyses, residual confounding and reverse causality could not be ruled out. Individuals with loneliness or social isolation have a higher risk of COPD, partly mediated through lifestyle factors.","Liu, Zhen; Xu, Minzhi; Yin, Xiaoxv",Journal of affective disorders,2025,"Humans; Social Isolation; Male; Loneliness; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Female; Life Style; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Incidence; Aged; United Kingdom; Risk Factors; Body Mass Index; Smoking; Alcohol Drinking; Exercise",COPD; Lifestyle factors; Loneliness; Mediation analysis; Social isolation,"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.; Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.

UK Biobank,33729212,Genome-wide association studies of low back pain and lumbar spinal disorders using electronic health record data identify a locus associated with lumbar spinal stenosis.,"Identifying genetic risk factors for lumbar spine disorders may lead to knowledge regarding underlying mechanisms and the development of new treatments. We conducted a genome-wide association study involving 100,811 participants with genotypes and longitudinal electronic health record data from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network and Geisinger Health. Cases and controls were defined using validated algorithms and clinical diagnostic codes. Electronic health record-defined phenotypes included low back pain requiring healthcare utilization (LBP-HC), lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LSRS), and lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). Genome-wide association study used logistic regression with additive genetic effects adjusting for age, sex, site-specific factors, and ancestry (principal components). A fixed-effect inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis was conducted. Genetic variants of genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8) were carried forward for replication in an independent sample from UK Biobank. Phenotype prevalence was 48.8% for LBP-HC, 19.8% for LSRS, and 7.9% for LSS. No variants were significantly associated with LBP-HC. One locus was associated with LSRS (lead variant rs146153280:C>G, odds ratio [OR] = 1.17 for G, P = 2.1 × 10-9), but was not replicated.

Given their dense phenotype data, biobanks can also facilitate replication studies on a phenome-wide scale. Here, we introduce the phenotype-genotype reference map (PGRM), a set of 5,879 genetic associations from 523 GWAS publications that can be used for high-throughput replication experiments. PGRM phenotypes are standardized as phecodes, ensuring interoperability between biobanks. We applied the PGRM to five ancestry-specific cohorts from four independent biobanks and found evidence of robust replications across a wide array of phenotypes. We show how the PGRM can be used to detect data corruption and to empirically assess parameters for phenome-wide studies. Finally, we use the PGRM to explore factors associated with replicability of GWAS results.","Bastarache, Lisa; Delozier, Sarah; Pandit, Anita; He, Jing; Lewis, Adam; Annis, Aubrey C; LeFaive, Jonathon; Denny, Joshua C; Carroll, Robert J; Altman, Russ B; Hughey, Jacob J; Zawistowski, Matthew; Peterson, Josh F",American journal of human genetics,2023,Humans; Biological Specimen Banks; Data Science; Phenomics; Phenotype; Genotype,GWAS; PheWAS; biobanks; data quality; electronic health records; phecodes; phenotyping; replication,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.

UK Biobank,36114182,Efficient and accurate frailty model approach for genome-wide survival association analysis in large-scale biobanks.,"With decades of electronic health records linked to genetic data, large biobanks provide unprecedented opportunities for systematically understanding the genetics of the natural history of complex diseases. Genome-wide survival association analysis can identify genetic variants associated with ages of onset, disease progression and lifespan. We propose an efficient and accurate frailty model approach for genome-wide survival association analysis of censored time-to-event (TTE) phenotypes by accounting for both population structure and relatedness. Our method utilizes state-of-the-art optimization strategies to reduce the computational cost. The saddlepoint approximation is used to allow for analysis of heavily censored phenotypes (>90%) and low frequency variants (down to minor allele count 20). We demonstrate the performance of our method through extensive simulation studies and analysis of five TTE phenotypes, including lifespan, with heavy censoring rates (90.9% to 99.8%) on ~400,000 UK Biobank participants with white British ancestry and ~180,000 individuals in FinnGen.

Some exposures, e.g., smoking or lipid levels, have common genetic modifiers identified in genome-wide association studies. Because measurements are often unfeasible, exposure polygenic risk scores (ExPRSs) offer an alternative to study the influence of exposures on various phenotypes. Here, we collected publicly available summary statistics for 28 exposures and applied four common PRS methods to generate ExPRSs in two large biobanks: the Michigan Genomics Initiative and the UK Biobank. We established ExPRSs for 27 exposures and demonstrated their applicability in phenome-wide association studies and as predictors for common chronic conditions. Especially the addition of multiple ExPRSs showed, for several chronic conditions, an improvement compared to prediction models that only included traditional, disease-focused PRSs. To facilitate follow-up studies, we share all ExPRS constructs and generated results via an online repository called ExPRSweb.","Ma, Ying; Patil, Snehal; Zhou, Xiang; Mukherjee, Bhramar; Fritsche, Lars G",American journal of human genetics,2022,Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Lipids; Multifactorial Inheritance; Risk Factors,EHR; GWAS; PGS; PRS; complex diseases; complex traits; electronic health records; exposures; polygenic risk scores; polygenic scores,"Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Michigan Institute for Data Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.

LTL in the peripheral blood was measured by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay from 439 961 individuals in the UK Biobank recruited between 2006 and 2010 and followed up until 2020. Electronic health records were used to record the incidence of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD). The brain structure, including total and regional brain volume, of 38 740 participants was then assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During a median follow-up of 11.6 years, a total of 5 820 (1.3%) dementia cases were documented. The restricted cubic spline model showed significant overall associations between LTL and the risk of dementia and AD (p for overall <0.05). The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the lowest LTL tertile compared with the highest LTL tertile were 1.14 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06 to 1.21) for dementia, 1.28 (95% CI: 1.12 to 1.46) for AD and 1.18 (95% CI: 0.98 to 1.42) for VD.

To inform methods for identifying stroke cases in UK Biobank (a prospective study of 503,000 UK adults recruited in middle-age), we systematically evaluated the accuracy of these data for stroke and its main pathological types (ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage), determining the optimum codes for case identification. We sought studies published from 1990-November 2013, which compared coded data from death certificates, hospital admissions or primary care with a reference standard for stroke or its pathological types. We extracted information on a range of study characteristics and assessed study quality with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Studies tool (QUADAS-2). To assess accuracy, we extracted data on positive predictive values (PPV) and-where available-on sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values (NPV). 37 of 39 eligible studies assessed accuracy of International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-coded hospital or death certificate data. They varied widely in their settings, methods, reporting, quality, and in the choice and accuracy of codes. Although PPVs for stroke and its pathological types ranged from 6-97%, appropriately selected, stroke-specific codes (rather than broad cerebrovascular codes) consistently produced PPVs >70%, and in several studies >90%. The few studies with data on sensitivity, specificity and NPV showed higher sensitivity of hospital versus death certificate data for stroke, with specificity and NPV consistently >96%. Few studies assessed either primary care data or combinations of data sources. Particular stroke-specific codes can yield high PPVs (>90%) for stroke/stroke types. Inclusion of primary care data and combining data sources should improve accuracy in large epidemiological studies, but there is limited published information about these strategies.","Woodfield, Rebecca; Grant, Ian; Sudlow, Cathie L M",PloS one,2015,Adult; Death Certificates; Electronic Health Records; Hospitalization; Humans; International Classification of Diseases; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Stroke; United Kingdom,,"Division of Clinical Neurosciences, Clinical Centre for Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Information Services Division, NHS, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Division of Clinical Neurosciences, Clinical Centre for Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; UK Biobank, Adswood, Stockport, United Kingdom.",10.1371/journal.pone.0140533
UK Biobank,37575973,Anxiety and Depression in People with Eczema or Psoriasis: A Comparison of Associations in UK Biobank and Linked Primary Care Data.,"Previous research has shown associations between eczema and psoriasis and anxiety and depression. We investigated whether associations are consistent across different settings of ascertainment for depression and anxiety, including interview and survey responses from UK Biobank (a large longitudinal cohort recruiting individuals aged 40-69 years between 2006-2010), and linked primary care data, with the aim of drawing more reliable conclusions through triangulation. In cross-sectional studies, we estimated associations between eczema or psoriasis and anxiety or depression, defining anxiety or depression as 1) self-reported previous diagnosis at UK Biobank recruitment interview; 2) PHQ-9/GAD-7 score indicating depression or anxiety from a UK Biobank mental health follow-up survey in 2016; and 3) diagnosis in linked primary care electronic health record data. We analysed 230,047 people with linked Biobank and primary care data. We found poor agreement between the data sources for eczema, psoriasis, anxiety, and depression. Eg, 9474 had a previous eczema diagnosis in primary care data, 4069 self-reported previous eczema diagnosis at the UK biobank interview, and 1536 had eczema in both data sources (for depression 40,455; 13,320; and 9588 respectively). Having eczema or psoriasis (recorded in primary care or baseline interview) was associated with higher odds of anxiety and depression. Eg, the adjusted odds ratio for depression comparing those with eczema to those without was greater than 1 when defining the outcome from 1) the recruitment interview (1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.27-1.45); 2) the follow-up survey (1.24, 1.09-1.39), and 3) primary care records (1.56, 1.50-1.62). Our findings support increased prevalence of mental illness in people with psoriasis and eczema across multiple data sources, which should be considered in planning of mental health services. However, we found poor agreement in disease ascertainment between settings, with implications for data interpretation in electronic health records.","Matthewman, Julian; Mansfield, Kathryn E; Hayes, Joseph F; Adesanya, Elizabeth I; Smith, Catherine H; Roberts, Amanda; Langan, Sinéad M; Henderson, Alasdair D",Clinical epidemiology,2023,,UK Biobank; anxiety; ascertainment; cross-sectional study; data linkage; depression; eczema; electronic health records; psoriasis,"Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK.; Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; St John's Institute of Dermatology, Kings College London, London, UK.; Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.; Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.",10.2147/CLEP.S417176
UK Biobank,36515951,"Adiposity, Body Fat Distribution, and Risk of Major Stroke Types Among Adults in the United Kingdom.","Uncertainty persists regarding the independent association of general and central adiposity with major stroke types. To determine the independent associations of general and central adiposity with risk of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Between 2006 and 2010, adults without prior stroke at recruitment in England, Scotland, and Wales were recruited into the UK Biobank prospective cohort study and were followed up through linkage with electronic medical records. Data were analyzed from September 2021 to September 2022. General adiposity (body mass index [BMI] calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and central adiposity (waist circumference). Incident ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage as recorded through record linkage with electronic hospital records. Cox regression estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) by stroke type. Among 490 071 participants, the mean (SD) age was 56.5 (8.1) years, 267 579 (54.6%) were female, and 461 647 (94.2%) were White. During a median (IQR) of 12 (11.2-12.7) years follow-up, 7117 incident ischemic strokes, 1391 intracerebral hemorrhages, and 834 subarachnoid hemorrhages were identified. After mutual adjustment for waist circumference, BMI had no independent association with ischemic stroke (HR per 5-unit higher BMI, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97-1.11), but was inversely associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.96) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.96). Waist circumference (adjusted for BMI) was positively associated with ischemic stroke (HR per 10-cm higher waist circumference, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13-1.25) and intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.30), but was not associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.93-1.22). In this large-scale prospective study, the independent and contrasting associations of BMI and waist circumference with stroke types suggests the importance of considering body fat distribution to stroke risk. Waist circumference was positively associated with the risk of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, while BMI was inversely associated with the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage. This study also suggests that some adverse correlate of low BMI may be associated with an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, which warrants further investigation.","Pillay, Preyanka; Lewington, Sarah; Taylor, Hannah; Lacey, Ben; Carter, Jennifer",JAMA network open,2022,"Adult; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Male; Adiposity; Prospective Studies; Subarachnoid Hemorrhage; Hemorrhagic Stroke; Obesity; Stroke; United Kingdom; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Obesity, Abdominal; Ischemic Stroke",,"Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, Big Data Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, Big Data Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit, Clinical Trial Service Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, Big Data Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, Big Data Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, Big Data Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.46613
UK Biobank,37790355,Development and Multinational Validation of a Novel Algorithmic Strategy for High Lp(a) Screening.,"Elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). However, fewer than 0.5% of patients undergo Lp(a) testing, limiting the evaluation and use of novel targeted therapeutics currently under development. We developed and validated a machine learning model to enable targeted screening for elevated Lp(a). Cross-sectional. 4 multinational population-based cohorts. We included 456,815 participants from the UK Biobank (UKB), the largest cohort with protocolized Lp(a) testing for model development. The model's external validity was assessed in Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) (N=14,484), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) (N=4,124), and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) (N=4,672) cohorts. Demographics, medications, diagnoses, procedures, vitals, and laboratory measurements from UKB and linked electronic health records (EHR) were candidate input features to predict high Lp(a). We used the pooled cohort equations (PCE), an ASCVD risk marker, as a comparator to identify elevated Lp(a). The main outcome was elevated Lp(a) (≥150 nmol/L), and the number-needed-to-test (NNT) to find one case with elevated Lp(a). We explored the association of the model's prediction probabilities with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and MACE. The Algorithmic Risk Inspection for Screening Elevated Lp(a) (ARISE) used low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, statin use, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, history of ASCVD, and anti-hypertensive medication use as input features. ARISE outperformed cardiovascular risk stratification through PCE for predicting elevated Lp(a) with a significantly lower NNT (4.0 versus 8.0 [with or without PCE], P<0.001). ARISE performed comparably across external validation cohorts and subgroups, reducing the NNT by up to 67.3%, depending on the probability threshold. Over a median follow-up of 4.2 years, a high ARISE probability was also associated with a greater hazard of all-cause death and MACE (age/sex-adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.35, and 1.38, respectively, P<0.001), with a greater increase in cardiovascular mortality (aHR, 2.17, P<0.001). ARISE optimizes screening for elevated Lp(a) using commonly available clinical features. ARISE can be deployed in EHR and other settings to encourage greater Lp(a) testing and to improve identifying cases eligible for novel targeted therapeutics in trials.","Aminorroaya, Arya; Dhingra, Lovedeep S; Oikonomou, Evangelos K; Saadatagah, Seyedmohammad; Thangaraj, Phyllis; Shankar, Sumukh Vasisht; Spatz, Erica S; Khera, Rohan",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2023,,,,10.1101/2023.09.18.23295745
UK Biobank,35381005,Reproducible disease phenotyping at scale: Example of coronary artery disease in UK Biobank.,"A lack of internationally agreed standards for combining available data sources at scale risks inconsistent disease phenotyping limiting research reproducibility. To develop and then evaluate if a rules-based algorithm can identify coronary artery disease (CAD) sub-phenotypes using electronic health records (EHR) and questionnaire data from UK Biobank (UKB). Case-control and cohort study. Prospective cohort study of 502K individuals aged 40-69 years recruited between 2006-2010 into the UK Biobank with linked hospitalization and mortality data and genotyping. We included all individuals for phenotyping into 6 predefined CAD phenotypes using hospital admission and procedure codes, mortality records and baseline survey data. Of these, 408,470 unrelated individuals of European descent had a polygenic risk score (PRS) for CAD estimated. CAD Phenotypes. Association with baseline risk factors, mortality (n = 14,419 over 7.8 years median f/u), and a PRS for CAD. The algorithm classified individuals with CAD into prevalent MI (n = 4,900); incident MI (n = 4,621), prevalent CAD without MI (n = 10,910), incident CAD without MI (n = 8,668), prevalent self-reported MI (n = 2,754); prevalent self-reported CAD without MI (n = 5,623), yielding 37,476 individuals with any type of CAD. Risk factors were similar across the six CAD phenotypes, except for fewer men in the self-reported CAD without MI group (46.7% v 70.1% for the overall group). In age- and sex- adjusted survival analyses, mortality was highest following incident MI (HR 6.66, 95% CI 6.07-7.31) and lowest for prevalent self-reported CAD without MI at baseline (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.15-1.50) compared to disease-free controls. There were similar graded associations across the six phenotypes per SD increase in PRS, with the strongest association for prevalent MI (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.46-1.55) and the weakest for prevalent self-reported CAD without MI (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.05-1.12). The algorithm is available in the open phenotype HDR UK phenotype library (https://portal.caliberresearch.org/). An algorithmic, EHR-based approach distinguished six phenotypes of CAD with distinct survival and PRS associations, supporting adoption of open approaches to help standardize CAD phenotyping and its wider potential value for reproducible research in other conditions.","Patel, Riyaz S; Denaxas, Spiros; Howe, Laurence J; Eggo, Rosalind M; Shah, Anoop D; Allen, Naomi E; Danesh, John; Hingorani, Aroon; Sudlow, Cathie; Hemingway, Harry",PloS one,2022,Biological Specimen Banks; Cohort Studies; Coronary Artery Disease; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Phenotype; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; United Kingdom,,"Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; NIHR University College London Biomedical Research Centre, University College London and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.; Health Data Research UK London, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; NIHR University College London Biomedical Research Centre, University College London and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.; Health Data Research UK London, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.; NIHR University College London Biomedical Research Centre, University College London and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.; Health Data Research UK London, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; UK Biobank Ltd, Stockport, United Kingdom.; Health Data Research UK Cambridge, Hinxton, United Kingdom.; Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom.; Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; NIHR University College London Biomedical Research Centre, University College London and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.; Health Data Research UK Scotland, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; HDR UK London, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.; NIHR University College London Biomedical Research Centre, University College London and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.; Health Data Research UK London, University College London, London, United Kingdom.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, United Kingdom.",10.1371/journal.pone.0264828

UK Biobank,38410800,Predicting early-onset COPD risk in adults aged 20-50 using electronic health records and machine learning.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health concern, affecting estimated 164 million people worldwide. Early detection and intervention strategies are essential to reduce the burden of COPD, but current screening approaches are limited in their ability to accurately predict risk. Machine learning (ML) models offer promise for improved accuracy of COPD risk prediction by combining genetic and electronic medical record data. In this study, we developed and evaluated eight ML models for primary screening of COPD utilizing routine screening data, polygenic risk scores (PRS), additional clinical data, or a combination of all three. To assess our models, we conducted a retrospective analysis of approximately 329,396 patients in the UK Biobank database. Incorporating personal information and blood biochemical test results significantly improved the model's accuracy for predicting COPD risk, achieving a best performance of 0.8505 AUC, a specificity of 0.8539 and a sensitivity of 0.7584. These results indicate that ML models can be effectively utilized for accurate prediction of COPD risk in individuals aged 20 to 50 years, providing a valuable tool for early detection and intervention.","Liu, Guanglei; Hu, Jiani; Yang, Jianzhe; Song, Jie",PeerJ,2024,"Adult; Humans; Electronic Health Records; Retrospective Studies; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Machine Learning; Databases, Factual",COPD; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Early-onset; Electronic health records; Genetic data; Machine learning; Polygenic risk scores; Risk prediction; UK Biobank,"School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China.; Ailurus Biotechnology Ltd., Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.; Ailurus Biotechnology Ltd., Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.; Ailurus Biotechnology Ltd., Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.",10.7717/peerj.16950
UK Biobank,33279681,Phenotype risk scores (PheRS) for pancreatic cancer using time-stamped electronic health record data: Discovery and validation in two large biobanks.,"Traditional methods for disease risk prediction and assessment, such as diagnostic tests using serum, urine, blood, saliva or imaging biomarkers, have been important for identifying high-risk individuals for many diseases, leading to early detection and improved survival. For pancreatic cancer, traditional methods for screening have been largely unsuccessful in identifying high-risk individuals in advance of disease progression leading to high mortality and poor survival. Electronic health records (EHR) linked to genetic profiles provide an opportunity to integrate multiple sources of patient information for risk prediction and stratification. We leverage a constellation of temporally associated diagnoses available in the EHR to construct a summary risk score, called a phenotype risk score (PheRS), for identifying individuals at high-risk for having pancreatic cancer. The proposed PheRS approach incorporates the time with respect to disease onset into the prediction framework. We combine and contrast the PheRS with more well-known measures of inherited susceptibility, namely, the polygenic risk scores (PRS) for prediction of pancreatic cancer. We first calculated pairwise, unadjusted associations between pancreatic cancer diagnosis and all possible other diagnoses across the medical phenome. We call these pairwise associations co-occurrences. After accounting for cross-phenotype correlations, the multivariable association estimates from a subset of relatively independent diagnoses were used to create a weighted sum PheRS. We constructed time-restricted risk scores using data from 38,359 participants in the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI) based on the diagnoses contained in the EHR at 0, 1, 2, and 5 years prior to the target pancreatic cancer diagnosis. The PheRS was assessed for predictability in the UK Biobank (UKB). We tested the relative contribution of PheRS when added to a model containing a summary measure of inherited genetic susceptibility (PRS) plus other covariates like age, sex, smoking status, drinking status, and body mass index (BMI). Our exploration of co-occurrence patterns identified expected associations while also revealing unexpected relationships that may warrant closer attention. Solely using the pancreatic cancer PheRS at 5 years before the target diagnoses yielded an AUC of 0.60 (95% CI = [0.58, 0.62]) in UKB. A larger predictive model including PheRS, PRS, and the covariates at the 5-year threshold achieved an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI = [0.72, 0.76]) in UKB. We note that PheRS does contribute independently in the joint model. Finally, scores at the top percentiles of the PheRS distribution demonstrated promise in terms of risk stratification. Scores in the top 2% were 10.20 (95% CI = [9.34, 12.99]) times more likely to identify cases than those in the bottom 98% in UKB at the 5-year threshold prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis. We developed a framework for creating a time-restricted PheRS from EHR data for pancreatic cancer using the rich information content of a medical phenome. In addition to identifying hypothesis-generating associations for future research, this PheRS demonstrates a potentially important contribution in identifying high-risk individuals, even after adjusting for PRS for pancreatic cancer and other traditional epidemiologic covariates. The methods are generalizable to other phenotypic traits.","Salvatore, Maxwell; Beesley, Lauren J; Fritsche, Lars G; Hanauer, David; Shi, Xu; Mondul, Alison M; Pearce, Celeste Leigh; Mukherjee, Bhramar",Journal of biomedical informatics,2021,Biological Specimen Banks; Electronic Health Records; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Michigan; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Phenotype; Risk Factors,EHR; Electronic health records; Michigan genomics initiative; Pancreatic cancer; Risk prediction; UK Biobank,"Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States; Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States.

UK Biobank,37489768,Using Polygenic Risk Scores for Prioritizing Individuals at Greatest Need of a Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment.,"Background The aim of this study was to provide quantitative evidence of the use of polygenic risk scores for systematically identifying individuals for invitation for full formal cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment. Methods and Results A total of 108 685 participants aged 40 to 69 years, with measured biomarkers, linked primary care records, and genetic data in UK Biobank were used for model derivation and population health modeling. Prioritization tools using age, polygenic risk scores for coronary artery disease and stroke, and conventional risk factors for CVD available within longitudinal primary care records were derived using sex-specific Cox models. We modeled the implications of initiating guideline-recommended statin therapy after prioritizing individuals for invitation to a formal CVD risk assessment. If primary care records were used to prioritize individuals for formal risk assessment using age- and sex-specific thresholds corresponding to 5% false-negative rates, then the numbers of men and women needed to be screened to prevent 1 CVD event are 149 and 280, respectively. In contrast, adding polygenic risk scores to both prioritization and formal assessments, and selecting thresholds to capture the same number of events, resulted in a number needed to screen of 116 for men and 180 for women. Conclusions Using both polygenic risk scores and primary care records to prioritize individuals at highest risk of a CVD event for a formal CVD risk assessment can efficiently prioritize those who need interventions the most than using primary care records alone. This could lead to better allocation of resources by reducing the number of risk assessments in primary care while still preventing the same number of CVD events.","Chung, Ryan; Xu, Zhe; Arnold, Matthew;

UK Biobank,36789288,"A platform for phenotyping disease progression and associated longitudinal risk factors in large-scale EHRs, with application to incident diabetes complications in the UK Biobank.","Modern healthcare data reflect massive multi-level and multi-scale information collected over many years. The majority of the existing phenotyping algorithms use case-control definitions of disease. This paper aims to study the time to disease onset and progression and identify the time-varying risk factors that drive them. We developed an algorithmic approach to phenotyping the incidence of diseases by consolidating data sources from the UK Biobank (UKB), including primary care electronic health records (EHRs). We focused on defining events, event dates, and their censoring time, including relevant terms and existing phenotypes, excluding generic, rare, or semantically distant terms, forward-mapping terminology terms, and expert review. We applied our approach to phenotyping diabetes complications, including a composite cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcome, diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and diabetic retinopathy (DR), in the UKB study. We identified 49 049 participants with diabetes. Among them, 1023 had type 1 diabetes (T1D), and 40 193 had type 2 diabetes (T2D). A total of 23 833 diabetes subjects had linked primary care records. There were 3237, 3113, and 4922 patients with CVD, DKD, and DR events, respectively. The risk prediction performance for each outcome was assessed, and our results are consistent with the prediction area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) of standard risk prediction models using cohort studies. Our publicly available pipeline and platform enable streamlined curation of incidence events, identification of time-varying risk factors underlying disease progression, and the definition of a relevant cohort for time-to-event analyses. These important steps need to be considered simultaneously to study disease progression.","Kim, Do Hyun; Jensen, Aubrey; Jones, Kelly; Raghavan, Sridharan; Phillips, Lawrence S; Hung, Adriana; Sun, Yan V; Li, Gang; Reaven, Peter; Zhou, Hua; Zhou, Jin J",JAMIA open,2023,,diabetes; diabetes complications; disease progression; electronic health records; phenotyping; time-to-event,"Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Department of Computer Science, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.; Division of Hospital Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA.; Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center, Aurora, Colorado, USA.; Division of Endocrinology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.; Atlanta VA Medical Center, Decatur, Georgia, USA.; VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Department of Computational Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Phoenix VA Health Care System, Phoenix, Arizona, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Department of Computational Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.; Phoenix VA Health Care System, Phoenix, Arizona, USA.; Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.",10.1093/jamiaopen/ooad006

UK Biobank,36574950,Individuals heterozygous for ALG8 protein-truncating variants are at increased risk of a mild cystic kidney disease.,"ALG8 protein-truncating variants (PTVs) have previously been described in patients with polycystic liver disease and in some cases cystic kidney disease. Given a lack of well-controlled studies, we determined whether individuals heterozygous for ALG8 PTVs are at increased risk of cystic kidney disease in a large, unselected health system-based observational cohort linked to electronic health records in Pennsylvania (Geisinger-Regeneron DiscovEHR MyCode study). Out of 174,172 patients, 236 were identified with ALG8 PTVs. Using ICD-based outcomes, patients with these variants were significantly at increased risk of having any kidney/liver cyst diagnosis (Odds Ratio 2.42, 95% confidence interval: 1.53-3.85), cystic kidney disease (3.03, 1.26-7.31), and nephrolithiasis (1.89, 1.96-2.97). To confirm this finding, blinded radiology review of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies was completed in a matched cohort of 52 thirty-plus year old ALG8 PTV heterozygotes and related non-heterozygotes. ALG8 PTV heterozygotes were significantly more likely to have cystic kidney disease, defined as four or more kidney cysts (57.7% vs. 7.7%), or bilateral kidney cysts (69.2% vs. 15.4%), but not one or more liver cyst (11.5% vs. 7.7%). In publicly available UK Biobank data, ALG8 PTV heterozygotes were at significantly increased risk of ICD code N28 (other disorders of kidney/ureter) (3.85% vs. 1.33%). ALG8 PTVs were not associated with chronic kidney disease or kidney failure in the MyCode study or the UK Biobank data. Thus, PTVs in ALG8 result in increased risk of a mild cystic kidney disease phenotype.","Apple, Benjamin; Sartori, Gino; Moore, Bryn; Chintam, Kiran; Singh, Gurmukteshwar; Anand, Prince Mohan; Strande, Natasha T; Mirshahi, Tooraj; Triffo, William; Chang, Alexander R",Kidney international,2023,"Humans; Polycystic Kidney Diseases; Kidney; Cysts; Liver Diseases; Polycystic Kidney, Autosomal Dominant; Glucosyltransferases",autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; chronic kidney disease; genetics; genotype-first; polycystic liver disease; renal cyst,"Department of Medicine, Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Radiology, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Genomic Health, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Nephrology, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Nephrology, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania, USA; Center for Kidney Health Research, Department of Population Health Sciences, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Nephrology, Medical University of South Carolina, Lancaster, South Carolina, USA.; Department of Genomic Health, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania, USA; Autism and Developmental Medicine Institute, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Genomic Health, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Radiology, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania, USA.; Department of Nephrology, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania, USA; Center for Kidney Health Research, Department of Population Health Sciences, Geisinger, Danville, Pennsylvania, USA.

UK Biobank,36927983,Clinical case study meets population cohort: identification of a BRCA1 pathogenic founder variant in Orcadians.,"We multiply ascertained the BRCA1 pathogenic missense variant c.5207T > C; p.Val1736Ala (V1736A) in clinical investigation of breast and ovarian cancer families from Orkney in the Northern Isles of Scotland, UK. We sought to investigate the frequency and clinical relevance of this variant in those of Orcadian ancestry as an exemplar of the value of population cohorts in clinical care, especially in isolated populations. Oral history and birth, marriage and death registrations indicated genealogical linkage of the clinical cases to ancestors from the Isle of Westray, Orkney. Further clinical cases were identified through targeted testing for V1736A in women of Orcadian ancestry attending National Health Service (NHS) genetic clinics for breast and ovarian cancer family risk assessments. The variant segregates with female breast and ovarian cancer in clinically ascertained cases. Separately, exome sequence data from 2088 volunteer participants with three or more Orcadian grandparents, in the ORCADES research cohort, was interrogated to estimate the population prevalence of V1736A in Orcadians. The effects of the variant were assessed using Electronic Health Record (EHR) linkage. Twenty out of 2088 ORCADES research volunteers (~1%) carry V1736A, with a common haplotype around the variant. This allele frequency is ~480-fold higher than in UK Biobank participants. Cost-effectiveness of population screening for BRCA1 founder pathogenic variants has been demonstrated at a carrier frequency below the ~1% observed here. Thus we suggest that Orcadian women should be offered testing for the BRCA1 V1736A founder pathogenic variant, starting with those with known Westray ancestry.","Kerr, Shona M; Cowan, Emma; Klaric, Lucija; Bell, Christine; O'Sullivan, Dawn; Buchanan, David; Grzymski, Joseph J; van Hout, Cristopher V; Tzoneva, Gannie; Shuldiner, Alan R; Wilson, James F; Miedzybrodzka, Zosia",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2023,Humans; Female; State Medicine; BRCA1 Protein; Ovarian Neoplasms; Gene Frequency; Haplotypes; Scotland; Breast Neoplasms; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; BRCA2 Protein; Genetic Testing,,"MRC Human Genetics Unit, University of Edinburgh, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK.; Department of Medical Genetics, Ashgrove House, NHS Grampian, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZA, UK.; MRC Human Genetics Unit, University of Edinburgh, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK.; Department of Medical Genetics, Ashgrove House, NHS Grampian, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZA, UK.; Department of Medical Genetics, Ashgrove House, NHS Grampian, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZA, UK.; MRC Human Genetics Unit, University of Edinburgh, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Desert Research Institute, Reno, NV, USA.; Renown Health, Reno, NV, USA.; Regeneron Genetics Center, Tarrytown, NY, USA.; Laboratorio Internacional de Investigatión sobre el Genoma Humano, Campus Juriquilla de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Querétaro, Querétaro, 76230, México.; Regeneron Genetics Center, Tarrytown, NY, USA.; Regeneron Genetics Center, Tarrytown, NY, USA.; MRC Human Genetics Unit, University of Edinburgh, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK.; Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Teviot Place, Edinburgh, EH8 9AG, UK.; Department of Medical Genetics, Ashgrove House, NHS Grampian, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZA, UK. zosia@abdn.ac.uk.; Medical Genetics Group, School of Medicine, Medical Sciences, Nutrition and Dentistry, University of Aberdeen, Polwarth Building, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZD, UK. zosia@abdn.ac.uk.",10.1038/s41431-023-01297-w
UK Biobank,39799755,Evaluation of a machine learning-based metabolic marker for coronary artery disease in the UK Biobank.,"An in silico quantitative score of coronary artery disease (ISCAD), built using machine learning and clinical data from electronic health records, has been shown to result in gradations of risk of subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease (CAD) sequelae, and mortality. Large-scale metabolite biomarker profiling provides increased portability and objectivity in machine learning for disease prediction and gradation. However, these models have not been fully leveraged. We evaluated a quantitative score of CAD derived from probabilities of a machine learning model trained on metabolomic data. We developed a CAD-predictive learning model using metabolic data from 93,642 individuals from the UK Biobank (median [IQR] age, 57 [14] years; 39,796 [42 %] male; 5640 [6 %] with diagnosed CAD), and assessed its probabilities as a quantitative metabolic risk score for CAD (M-CAD; range 0 [lowest probability] to 1 [highest probability]) in participants of the UK Biobank. The relationship of M-CAD with arterial stiffness index, ejection fraction, CAD sequelae, and mortality was assessed. The model predicted CAD with an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve of 0.712. Arterial Stiffness Index increased by 0.19 and ejection fraction decreased by 0.2 % per 0.1 increase in M-CAD. Both incident and recurrent myocardial infarction increased stepwise over M-CAD quartiles (odds ratio (OR) 15.3 [4.2 %] and 12.5 [0.2 %]) in top quartiles as compared to the first quartile of incident and recurrent MI respectively). Likewise, the hazard ratio and prevalence of all-cause mortality, CVD-associated mortality, and CAD-associated mortality increased stepwise over M-CAD deciles (2.98 [14 %], 9.34 [4.3 %], 26.7 [2.7 %] in the top deciles as compared to the first decile of all-cause, CVD, and CAD mortality respectively). Metabolic-based machine learning can be used to build a quantitative risk score for CAD that is associated with atherosclerotic burden, CAD sequelae and mortality.","Gibson, Kyle; Forrest, Iain S; Petrazzini, Ben O; Duffy, Áine; Park, Joshua K; Malick, Waqas; Rosenson, Robert S; Rocheleau, Ghislain; Jordan, Daniel M; Do, Ron",Atherosclerosis,2025,Humans; Coronary Artery Disease; Male; Machine Learning; Female; Middle Aged; United Kingdom; Biomarkers; Aged; Biological Specimen Banks; Risk Assessment; Metabolomics; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Prognosis; UK Biobank,Biobank; Coronary artery disease; Machine learning; Metabolic; Personalized; Quantitative risk score,"The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Medical Scientist Training Program, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Center for Genomic Data Analytics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Medical Scientist Training Program, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Zena and Michael A.

UK Biobank,37886491,USING MACHINE LEARNING METHODS TO ASSESS THE RISK OF ALCOHOL MISUSE IN OLDER ADULTS.,"The population of older adults, defined in this study as those 50 years of age or older, continues to increase every year. Substance misuse, particularly alcohol misuse, is often neglected in these individuals. To better identify older adults who might not be properly assessed for alcohol misuse, we have derived a risk assessment tool using patients from the United Kingdom Biobank (UKB), which was validated on patients in the Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) electronic health record (EHR). The model and tooling created stratifies the risk of alcohol misuse in older adults using 10 features that are commonly found in most EHR systems. We found that the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) to correctly predict alcohol misuse in older adults for the UKB and WCM models were 0.84 and 0.78, respectively. We further show that of those who self-identified as having ongoing alcohol misuse in the UKB cohort, only 12.5% of these patients had any alcohol-related F.10 ICD-10 code. Extending this to the WCM cohort, we forecast that 7,838 out of 12,360 older adults with no F.10 ICD-10 code (63.4%) may be missed as having alcohol misuse in the EHR. Overall, this study importantly prioritizes the health of older adults by being able to predict alcohol misuse in an understudied population.","Wickersham, Matthew; Bartelo, Nicholas; Kulm, Scott; Liu, Yifan; Zhang, Yiye; Elemento, Olivier",Research square,2023,,,"Weill-Cornell/Rockefeller/Sloan-Kettering Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program, New York, New York, United States.; Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States.; Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States.; Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States.; Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States.; Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States.; Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, United States.",10.21203/rs.3.rs-3154584/v1
UK Biobank,36736868,Polygenic Contributions to Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions in a Large Electronic Health Record Sample.,"Chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) are believed to share common etiological mechanisms involving central sensitization. Genetic and environmental factors putatively combine to influence susceptibility to central sensitization and COPCs. This study employed a genome-wide polygenic risk score approach to evaluate genetic influences on 8 common COPCs. COPCs were identified by International Classification of Disease codes in Vanderbilt's deidentified clinical biorepository (BioVU), with each COPC condition empirically weighted for the level of central sensitization based on prior work. A centralized pain score (CPS) was calculated for 55,340 individuals by summing the weighted number of COPCs. Overall, 12,502 individuals (22.6%) were diagnosed with at least 1 COPC, with females exhibiting nearly twice the mean CPS as males. To assess the genetic influence on centralized pain in COPCs, 6 pain polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were developed using UK Biobank data to predict 6 pain criteria (no pain, neck/shoulder, abdomen, hip, knee, low back pain). These PRSs were then deployed in the BioVU cohort to test for association with CPS. In regression models adjusted for age, sex, and BMI, all pain PRSs except hip pain were significantly associated with CPS. Our findings support a shared polygenic influence across COPCs potentially involving central sensitization mechanisms.

Significant findings in this study provide evidence supporting previous hypotheses that a shared polygenic influence involving central sensitization may underly chronic overlapping pain conditions and can guide future biomarker and risk assessment research.","Schirle, Lori; Samuels, David C; Faucon, Annika; Cox, Nancy J; Bruehl, Stephen",The journal of pain,2023,Male; Female; Humans; Chronic Pain; Electronic Health Records; Chronic Disease; Risk Factors; Central Nervous System Sensitization,Chronic overlapping pain conditions; central sensitization; chronic pain; genetic; polygenic risk score,"Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, Nashville, Tennessee.

UK Biobank,37310901,Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 in older persons: multi-organ complications and mortality.,"Evidence on long-term associations between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and risks of multi-organ complications and mortality in older population is limited. This study evaluates these associations. The cohorts included patients aged ≥60 year diagnosed with COVID-19 infection (cases), between 16 March 2020 and 31 May 2021 from the UK Biobank; and between 01 April 2020 and 31 May 2022 from the electronic health records in Hong Kong. Each patient was randomly matched with individuals without COVID-19 infection based on year of birth and sex and were followed for up to 18 months until 31 August 2021 for UKB, and up to 28 months until 15 August 2022 for HK cohort. Patients with COVID-19 infection over 6 months after the date of last dose of vaccination and their corresponding controls were excluded from our study. Characteristics between cohorts were further adjusted with Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting. For evaluating long-term association of COVID-19 with multi-organ disease complications and mortality after 21-days of diagnosis, Cox regression was employed. 10,759 (UKB) and 165,259 (HK) older adults with COVID-19 infection with matched 291,077 (UKB) and 1,100,394 (HK) non-COVID-19-diagnosed older adults were recruited. Older adults with COVID-19 were associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes [major cardiovascular disease (stroke, heart failure and coronary heart disease): hazard ratio(UKB): 1.4 (95% Confidence interval: 1.1,1.6), HK:1.2 (95% CI: 1.1,1.3)]; myocardial infarction: HR(UKB): 1.8 (95% CI: 1.3,2.4), HK:1.2 (95% CI: 1.0,1.4)]; respiratory outcomes [interstitial lung disease: HR(UKB: 3.4 (95% CI: 2.5,4.5), HK: 4.0 (95% CI: 1.3,12.8); chronic pulmonary disease: HR(UKB): 1.7 (95% CI: 1.3,2.2), HK:1.6 (95% CI: 1.3,2.1)]; neuropsychiatric outcomes [seizure: HR(UKB): 2.6 (95% CI: 1.7,4.1), HK: 1.6 (95% CI: 1.2,2.1)]; and renal outcomes [acute kidney disease: HR(UKB): 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1,1.6), HK:1.6 (95% CI: 1.3,2.1)]; and all-cause mortality [HR(UKB): 4.9 (95% CI: 4.4,5.4), HK:2.5 (95% CI: 2.5,2.6)]. COVID-19 is associated with long-term risks of multi-organ complications in older adults (aged ≥ 60). Infected patients in this age-group may benefit from appropriate monitoring of signs/symptoms for developing these complications.","Wan, Eric Yuk Fai; Zhang, Ran; Mathur, Sukriti; Yan, Vincent Ka Chun; Lai, Francisco Tsz Tsun; Chui, Celine Sze Ling; Li, Xue; Wong, Carlos King Ho; Chan, Esther Wai Yin; Lau, Chak Sing; Wong, Ian Chi Kei",Journal of travel medicine,2023,Aged; Humans; Cardiovascular Diseases; COVID-19; Disease Progression; Hong Kong; Middle Aged; Male; Female,Hong Kong; Long COVID; SARS-CoV-2; UK; elderly persons; public health emergency of international concern,"Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; School of Nursing, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Pharmacy, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518053, China.; The University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation, Shenzhen 518053, China.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; Aston Pharmacy School, Aston University, Birmingham B4 7ET, UK.",10.1093/jtm/taad082

Whether there is a causal association between plasma galectin-3 levels and NAFLD is unknown. To evaluate the causal effect of circulating galectin-3 levels on NAFLD as well as >800 other human diseases. Inverse variance-weighted (IVW) Mendelian randomization (MR) and phenome-wide MR. Summary statistics of genome-wide association studies. Participants of the UK Biobank, Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), FinnGen, Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND), and IMPROVE cohorts. Identification of independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with galectin-3 levels (P < 5 × 10-8) in the PREVEND (14 SNPs) and IMPROVE (3 SNPs) cohorts. Presence of NAFLD in a meta-analysis of genome-wide association study of the eMERGE, UK Biobank, and FinnGen cohorts (3042 NAFLD cases and 504 853 controls), as well as >800 other human diseases in the UK Biobank and FinnGen. Using IVW-MR, we found no causal association between galectin-3 levels and NAFLD in the meta-analysis of the 3 cohorts or in each individual cohort. After correction for multiple testing, we found no causal association between galectin-3 levels and >800 human disease-related traits. This MR study revealed no causal associations between circulating galectin-3 levels and NAFLD or any other disease traits, suggesting that plasma galectin-3 levels may not be directly implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD or other human diseases.","Tremblay, Maxime; Perrot, Nicolas; Ghodsian, Nooshin; Gobeil, Émilie; Couture, Christian; Mitchell, Patricia L; Thériault, Sébastien; Arsenault, Benoit J",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2021,"Adult; Alleles; Child; Female; Galectin 3; Gene Frequency; Humans; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",Mendelian randomization; galectin-3; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; phenome-wide association study,"Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec, Québec, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec, Québec, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec, Québec, Canada.; Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec, Québec, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec, Québec, Canada.; Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec, Québec, Canada.; Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec, Québec, Canada.; Department of Molecular Biology, Medical Biochemistry and Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, Canada.; Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec, Québec, Canada.; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, Canada.",10.1210/clinem/dgab144

We introduce GRASP, a novel transformer-based architecture that enhances the generalizability of EHR-based prediction by embedding medical codes into a unified semantic space using a large language model. We applied GRASP to predict the onset of 21 diseases and all-cause mortality in over one million individuals from UK Biobank (UK), FinnGen (Finland) and Mount Sinai (USA), all harmonized to OMOP common data model. Trained on the UK Biobank and evaluated in FinnGen and Mount Sinai, GRASP achieved an average ΔC-index that was 83% and 35% higher than language-unaware models, respectively. GRASP also showed significantly higher correlations with polygenic risk scores for 62% of diseases. Notably, GRASP mantained robust performance even when datasets were not harmonized to the same data model, accurately predicting disease risk from ICD-10-CM codes without direct mappings to OMOP. GRASP enables accurate and transferable disease predictions across heterogeneous healthcare systems with minimal resource requirements.","Kirchler, Matthias; Ferro, Matteo; Lorenzini, Veronica; Lippert, Christoph; Ganna, Andrea",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025,,,"Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam, Digital Engineering Faculty, Potsdam, Germany.; Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY, US.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam, Digital Engineering Faculty, Potsdam, Germany.; Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY, US.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.",10.1101/2025.02.03.25321597
UK Biobank,35194621,"The public health impact of poor sleep on severe COVID-19, influenza and upper respiratory infections.","Poor sleep is associated with an increased risk of infections and all-cause mortality, and acute sleep loss and disruption have been linked with inflammation and poorer immune control. Previous studies, however, have been unable to evidence causality between the chronic effects of poor sleep and respiratory infection risk. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and potential future disease outbreaks, understanding the risk factors for these infections is of great importance. Our goal was to understand if chronic poor sleep could be identified as a causal risk factor for respiratory infections including influenza, upper respiratory infections and COVID-19. We used population cohorts from the UK Biobank (N ≈ 231,000) and FinnGen (N ≈ 327,000) with ICD-10 based electronic health records and obtained diagnoses of insomnia, influenza and upper respiratory infections (URIs) from primary care and hospital settings. We computed logistic regression to assess association between poor sleep and infections, disease free survival hazard ratios, and used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of insomnia, influenza, URI and COVID-19 to perform Mendelian randomization analyses and assess causality. Utilizing 23 years of registry data and follow-up, we saw that insomnia diagnosis associated with increased risk for infections in FinnGen and in UK Biobank (FinnGen influenza HR = 5.32 [4.09, 6.92], P = 1.02×10 Our findings indicate that chronic poor sleep is a causal risk factor for contracting respiratory infections, and in addition contributes to the severity of respiratory infections. These findings highlight the role of sleep in maintaining sufficient immune response against pathogens as suggested by earlier work. As the current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the number of people suffering from poor sleep, safe interventions such as sleep management and treating individuals with insomnia could be promoted to reduce infections and save lives.","Jones, Samuel E; Maisha, Fahrisa I; Strausz, Satu J; Cade, Brian E; Tervi, Anniina M; Helaakoski, Viola; Broberg, Martin E; Lammi, Vilma; Lane, Jacqueline M; Redline, Susan; Saxena, Richa; Ollila, Hanna M",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2022,,,"Institute for Molecular Medicine, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Immunology and Dermatology, Yale University, School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Institute for Molecular Medicine, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Finland.; Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Institute for Molecular Medicine, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Finland.; Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard T.H.

UK Biobank,39819616,Association of weight change with cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in obese participants with cardiovascular disease: a prospective cohort study.,"Studies have examined the association between weight change and risk of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in the general population. However, very few literature reported the association among obese people with established CV disease (CVD) and the factors associated with weight change are not clear. We sought to investigate this using the UK Biobank data. In this large prospective population-based cohort study, absolute interval change scores in weight were calculated between weight measurements at baseline and the follow-up. The estimated HRs with 95% CIs were obtained from the Cox regression models to assess the association between weight change and the risk of CV death, cerebrovascular and ischaemic heart diseases and all-cause mortality. Of the 8297 obese participants who had CVD with repeated weight measurements, 43.1% were female. The mean age was 56.6 (SD: 7.2) years. The overall median follow-up of the study was 13.9 (IQR: 13.1-14.6) years. 52.7% of the participants had stable weight change (weight loss or gain<5 kg), 14.2% had large weight loss (≥10 kg) and 5.1% had large weight gain (≥10 kg). Compared with stable weight, only large weight gain was associated with an increased risk of CV death and all-cause mortality (fully adjusted HR (95% CI): 3.05 (1.40 to 6.67) for CV death and 1.93 (1.15 to 3.26) for all-cause mortality). Among obese individuals with CVD, large weight gain is associated with a higher risk of CV death and all-cause mortality. Further studies are needed to understand the exact mechanisms underlying the associations between weight loss or weight gain and mortality.","Zhang, Jufen; Schutte, Rudolph; Pierscionek, Barbara",Heart (British Cardiac Society),2025,Humans; Female; Obesity; Middle Aged; Male; Prospective Studies; Cardiovascular Diseases; Weight Gain; United Kingdom; Cause of Death; Weight Loss; Aged; Risk Factors; Risk Assessment,Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Electronic Health Records; Obesity; Risk Factors,"Clinical Trials Unit, School of Medicine, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Social Care, Medical Technology Research Centre, Anglia Ruskin University, Chelmsford, UK jufen.zhang@aru.ac.uk.; School of Allied Health, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Social Care, Medical Technology Research Centre, Anglia Ruskin University, Chelmsford, UK.; Medical Technology Research Centre, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Social Care, Anglia Ruskin University, Chelmsford, UK.",10.1136/heartjnl-2024-324383

To identify genetic influences underlying ARHI, we conducted a genome-wide association study of ARHI in 6,527 cases and 45,882 controls among the non-Hispanic whites from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. We identified two novel genome-wide significant SNPs: rs4932196 (odds ratio = 1.185, p = 4.0x10-11), 52Kb 3' of ISG20, which replicated in a meta-analysis of the other GERA race/ethnicity groups (1,025 cases, 12,388 controls, p = 0.00094) and in a UK Biobank case-control analysis (30,802 self-reported cases, 78,586 controls, p = 0.015); and rs58389158 (odds ratio = 1.132, p = 1.8x10-9), which replicated in the UK Biobank (p = 0.00021). The latter SNP lies just outside exon 8 and is highly correlated (r2 = 0.96) with the missense SNP rs5756795 in exon 7 of TRIOBP, a gene previously associated with prelingual nonsyndromic hearing loss. We further tested these SNPs in phenotypes from audiologist notes available on a subset of GERA (4,903 individuals), stratified by case/control status, to construct an independent replication test, and found a significant effect of rs58389158 on speech reception threshold (SRT; overall GERA meta-analysis p = 1.9x10-6). We also tested variants within exons of 132 other previously-identified hearing loss genes, and identified two common additional significant SNPs: rs2877561 (synonymous change in ILDR1, p = 6.2x10-5), which replicated in the UK Biobank (p = 0.00057), and had a significant GERA SRT (p = 0.00019) and speech discrimination score (SDS; p = 0.0019); and rs9493627 (missense change in EYA4, p = 0.00011) which replicated in the UK Biobank (p = 0.0095), other GERA groups (p = 0.0080), and had a consistent significant result for SRT (p = 0.041) and suggestive result for SDS (p = 0.081).

UK Biobank,33763119,Genome-Wide Identification of Rare and Common Variants Driving Triglyceride Levels in a Nevada Population.,"Clinical conditions correlated with elevated triglyceride levels are well-known: coronary heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Underlying genetic and phenotypic mechanisms are not fully understood, partially due to lack of coordinated genotypic-phenotypic data. Here we use a subset of the Healthy Nevada Project, a population of 9,183 sequenced participants with longitudinal electronic health records to examine consequences of altered triglyceride levels. Specifically, Healthy Nevada Project participants sequenced by the Helix Exome+ platform were cross-referenced to their electronic medical records to identify: (1) rare and common single-variant genome-wide associations; (2) gene-based associations using a Sequence Kernel Association Test; (3) phenome-wide associations with triglyceride levels; and (4) pleiotropic variants linked to triglyceride levels. The study identified 549 significant single-variant associations (","Read, Robert W; Schlauch, Karen A; Lombardi, Vincent C; Cirulli, Elizabeth T; Washington, Nicole L; Lu, James T; Grzymski, Joseph J",Frontiers in genetics,2021,,GWAS; PheWAS; rare variant analysis; triglycerides; whole exome sequencing,"Center for Genomic Medicine, Desert Research Institute, Reno, NV, United States.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Desert Research Institute, Reno, NV, United States.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Nevada, Reno, Reno, NV, United States.; Helix Opco, LLC., San Mateo, CA, United States.; Helix Opco, LLC., San Mateo, CA, United States.; Helix Opco, LLC., San Mateo, CA, United States.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Desert Research Institute, Reno, NV, United States.; Renown Health, Reno, NV, United States.",10.3389/fgene.2021.639418
UK Biobank,39438716,Two founder variants account for over 90% of pathogenic BRCA alleles in the Orkney and Shetland Isles in Scotland.,"For breast and ovarian cancer risk assessment in the isolated populations of the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland (in Scotland, UK) and their diasporas, quantifying genetically drifted BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants is important. Two actionable variants in these genes have reached much higher frequencies than in cosmopolitan UK populations. Here, we report a BRCA2 splice acceptor variant, c.517-2A>G, found in breast and ovarian cancer families from Shetland. We investigated the frequency and origin of this variant in a population-based research cohort of people of Shetland ancestry, VIKING I. The variant segregates with female breast and ovarian cancer in diagnosed cases and is classified as pathogenic. Exome sequence data from 2108 VIKING I participants with three or more Shetlandic grandparents was used to estimate the population prevalence of c.517-2A>G in Shetlanders. Nine VIKING I research volunteers carry this variant, on a shared haplotype (carrier frequency 0.4%). This frequency is ~130-fold higher than in UK Biobank, where the small group of carriers has a different haplotype. Records of birth, marriage and death indicate genealogical linkage of VIKING I carriers to a founder from the Isle of Whalsay, Shetland, similar to our observations for the BRCA1 founder variant c.5207T>C from Westray, Orkney. In total, 93.5% of pathogenic BRCA variant carriers in Northern Isles exomes are accounted for by these two drifted variants. We thus provide the scientific evidence of an opportunity for screening people of Orcadian and Shetlandic origins for each drifted pathogenic variant, particularly women with Westray or Whalsay ancestry.","Kerr, Shona M; Klaric, Lucija; Muckian, Marisa D; Cowan, Emma; Snadden, Lesley; Tzoneva, Gannie; Shuldiner, Alan R; Miedzybrodzka, Zosia; Wilson, James F",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2024,Humans; Female; Scotland; BRCA1 Protein; BRCA2 Protein; Founder Effect; Ovarian Neoplasms; Breast Neoplasms; Haplotypes; Alleles; Pedigree,,"MRC Human Genetics Unit, University of Edinburgh, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK.; MRC Human Genetics Unit, University of Edinburgh, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK.; Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Teviot Place, Edinburgh, EH8 9AG, UK.; Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London, WC1E 7HT, UK.; Department of Medical Genetics, Ashgrove House, NHS Grampian, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZA, UK.; Department of Medical Genetics, Ashgrove House, NHS Grampian, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZA, UK.; Regeneron Genetics Center, Tarrytown, NY, USA.; Regeneron Genetics Center, Tarrytown, NY, USA.; Department of Medical Genetics, Ashgrove House, NHS Grampian, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZA, UK.; Medical Genetics Group, University of Aberdeen, Polwarth Building, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZD, UK.; MRC Human Genetics Unit, University of Edinburgh, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK. jim.wilson@ed.ac.uk.; Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Teviot Place, Edinburgh, EH8 9AG, UK. jim.wilson@ed.ac.uk.; Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK. jim.wilson@ed.ac.uk.",10.1038/s41431-024-01704-w
UK Biobank,35994481,Identifying genetic variants associated with the ICD10 (International Classification of Diseases10)-based diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease using a large-scale biomedical database.,"To utilize the UK Biobank to identify genetic variants associated with the ICD10 (International Classification of Diseases10)-based diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease (CeVD). Cerebrovascular disease occurs because of a complex interplay between vascular, environmental, and genetic factors. It is the second leading cause of disability worldwide. Understanding who may be genetically predisposed to cerebrovascular disease can help guide preventative efforts. Moreover, there is considerable interest in the use of real-world data, such as EHR (electronic health records) to better understand disease mechanisms and to discover new treatment strategies, but whether ICD10-based diagnosis can be used to study CeVD genetics is unknown. Using the UK Biobank, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) where we analyzed the genomes of 11,155 cases and 122,705 controls who were sex, age and ancestry-matched in a 1:11 case: control design. Genetic variants were identified by Plink's firth logistic regression and assessed for association with the ICD10 codes corresponding to CeVD. We identified two groups of SNPs closely linked to PITX2 and LRRTM4 that were significantly associated with CeVD in this study (p < 5 x 10-8) and had a minor allele frequency of > 0.5%. Disease assignment based on ICD10 codes may underestimate prevalence; however, for CeVD, this does not appear to be the case. Compared to the age- and sex-matched control population, individuals with CeVD were more frequently diagnosed with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia & atrial fibrillation or flutter, confirming their contribution to CeVD. The UK Biobank based ICD10 study identified 2 groups of variants that were associated with CeVD. The association between PITX2 and CeVD is likely explained by the increased rates of atrial fibrillation and flutter. While the mechanism explaining the relationship between LRRTM4 and CeVD is unclear, this has been documented in previous studies.","Alkhalfan, Fahad; Gyftopoulos, Alex; Chen, Yi-Ju; Williams, Charles H; Perry, James A; Hong, Charles C",PloS one,2022,"Atrial Fibrillation; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,"University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.; University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.; University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.; University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.; University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.; University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.",10.1371/journal.pone.0273217
UK Biobank,34081057,Association of COA1 with Patellar Tendonitis: A Genome-wide Association Analysis.,"It is unknown why some athletes develop patellar tendinopathy and others do not, even when accounting for similar workloads between individuals. Genetic differences between these two populations may be a contributing factor. The purpose of this work was to screen the entire genome for genetic markers associated with patellar tendinopathy. Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses were performed utilizing data from the Kaiser Permanente Research Board (KPRB) and the UK Biobank. Patellar tendinopathy cases were identified based on electronic health records from KPRB and UK Biobank. GWA analyses from both cohorts were tested for patellar tendinopathy using a logistic regression model adjusting for sex, height, weight, age, and race/ethnicity using allele counts for single nucleotide polymorphisms. The data from the two GWA studies (KPRB and UK Biobank) were combined in a meta-analysis. There were a total of 1670 cases of patellar tendinopathy and 293,866 controls within the two cohorts. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms located in the intron of the cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 1 (COA1) gene showed a genome-wide significant association in the meta-analysis. Genetic markers in COA1 seem to be associated with patellar tendinopathy and are potential risk factors for patellar tendinopathy that deserve further validation regarding molecular mechanisms.","Kim, Stuart K; Nguyen, Condor; Horton, Brandon H; Avins, Andrew L; Abrams, Geoffrey D",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2021,"Athletic Injuries; Electron Transport Complex IV; Female; Genetic Markers; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patellar Ligament; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Tendinopathy",,"Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.; Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.; Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Division of Research, Oakland, CA.; Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Division of Research, Oakland, CA.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.",10.1249/MSS.0000000000002710
UK Biobank,38239263,"Sick individuals, sick populations revisited: a test of the Rose hypothesis for type 2 diabetes disparities.","The Rose hypothesis predicts that since genetic variation is greater within than between populations, genetic risk factors will be associated with individuals' risk of disease but not population disparities, and since socioenvironmental variation is greater between than within populations, socioenvironmental risk factors will be associated with population disparities but not individuals' disease risk. We used the UK Biobank to test the Rose hypothesis for type 2 diabetes (T2D) ethnic disparities in the UK. Our cohort consists of 26 912 participants from Asian, black and white ethnic groups. Participants were characterised as T2D cases or controls based on the presence or absence of T2D diagnosis codes in electronic health records. T2D genetic risk was measured using a polygenic risk score (PRS), and socioeconomic deprivation was measured with the Townsend Index (TI). The variation of genetic (PRS) and socioeconomic (TI) risk factors within and between ethnic groups was calculated using analysis of variance. Multivariable logistic regression was used to associate PRS and TI with T2D cases, and mediation analysis was used to analyse the effect of PRS and TI on T2D ethnic group disparities. T2D prevalence differs for Asian 23.34% (OR=5.14, CI=4.68 to 5.65), black 16.64% (OR=3.81, CI=3.44 to 4.22) and white 7.35% (reference) ethnic groups in the UK. Both genetic and socioenvironmental T2D risk factors show greater within (w) than between (b) ethnic group variation: PRS w=64.60%, b=35.40%; TI w=71.18%, b=28.19%. Nevertheless, both genetic risk (PRS OR=1.96, CI=1.87 to 2.07) and socioeconomic deprivation (TI OR=1.09, CI=1.08 to 1.10) are associated with T2D individual risk and mediate T2D ethnic disparities (Asian PRS=22.5%, TI=9.8%; black PRS=32.0%, TI=25.3%). A relative excess of within-group versus between-group variation does not preclude T2D risk factors from contributing to T2D ethnic disparities. Our results support an integrative approach to health disparities research that includes both genetic and socioenvironmental risk factors.","Gupta, Sonali; Jordan, I King; Mariño-Ramírez, Leonardo",BMJ public health,2023,,,"National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland, USA.; School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.; National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland, USA.",10.1136/bmjph-2023-000655

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and patient data applied toward early prediction of PCa may lead to earlier interventions and increased survival. We have developed machine learning (ML) models to predict PCa risk in men 55 and under using PRSs combined with patient data. We conducted a retrospective study on 91,106 male patients aged 35-55 using the UK Biobank database. Five gradient boosting models were developed and validated utilizing routine screening data, PRSs, additional clinical data, or combinations of the three. Combinations of PRSs and patient data outperformed models that utilized PRS or patient data only, and the highest performing models achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.788. Our models demonstrated a substantially lower false positive rate (35.4%) in comparison to standard screening using prostate-specific antigen (60%-67%). This study provides the first preliminary evidence for the use of PRSs with patient data in a ML algorithm for PCa risk prediction in men aged 55 and under for whom screening is not standard practice.","Varma, Amita; Maharjan, Jenish; Garikipati, Anurag; Hurtado, Myrna; Shokouhi, Sepideh; Mao, Qingqing",Cancer medicine,2023,"Humans; Male; Electronic Health Records; Prostatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Adult; Middle Aged; Databases, Factual; Predictive Value of Tests",algorithms; decision support; machine learning; polygenic risk score; prostate cancer,"Dascena Inc., Houston, Texas, USA.; Dascena Inc., Houston, Texas, USA.; Dascena Inc., Houston, Texas, USA.; Dascena Inc., Houston, Texas, USA.; Dascena Inc., Houston, Texas, USA.; Dascena Inc., Houston, Texas, USA.; Montera Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA.",10.1002/cam4.4934
UK Biobank,39521299,Association of premature natural and surgical menopause with incidence of depression requiring hospitalization: a prospective cohort study.,"Premature menopause is associated with depression in postmenopausal women. However, current evidence ignores the differences between premature natural and surgical menopause, and there is a lack of exploration of the mechanisms underlying the association between premature menopause and depression. To examine the association of premature natural and surgical menopause with incidence of depression requiring hospitalization, and to evaluate whether frailty and menopausal hormone therapy are significant factors contributing to a higher incidence of depression requiring hospitalization associated with premature natural and surgical menopause, in comparison to women who experience menopause after age 40. This cohort included 139,691 postmenopausal women from the UK Biobank, 44,734 of whom participated the 7-year online mental health survey. Reproductive histories were obtained at enrollment. Depression requiring hospitalization was identified based on electronic health records and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Cox proportional hazard models and Poisson regression models were fitted. During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 12.53 (11.71-13.25) years, 7563 participants (5.41%) developed depression requiring hospitalization. In the fully adjusted model, compared with women who experienced menopause >40, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of those with premature natural and surgical menopause for depression requiring hospitalization were 1.27 (1.17-1.38) and 1.76 (1.43-2.16), respectively. Similar findings were observed in the association of premature natural (risk ratio=1.17, 95% confidence interval: 1.00-1.39) and surgical menopause (risk ratio=1.62, 95% confidence interval: 1.05-2.51) with depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score. An inverse dose-response relationship was observed in the analysis of alternate age thresholds and depression requiring hospitalization. When premature natural menopause was compared with women who experienced menopause >40, the proportion of the mediating effect of frailty and menopausal hormone therapy on depression requiring hospitalization was 27.43% (9.53%-229.00%) and 65.15% (45.57%-136.00%), respectively. When premature surgical menopause was compared with women who experienced menopause >40, the proportion of the mediating effect of frailty and menopausal hormone therapy on depression requiring hospitalization was 8.30% (2.59%-34.00%), 42.90% (27.96%-81.00%), respectively. Premature menopause, especially surgical premature menopause, is significantly associated with depression requiring hospitalization in women. Frailty and adjustment of hormone therapy strategies during menopause may be potential targets for intervention.","Xu, Minzhi; Yin, Xiaoxv; Gong, Yanhong",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,2025,"Humans; Female; Middle Aged; Hospitalization; Prospective Studies; Menopause, Premature; Depression; Incidence; Adult; United Kingdom; Proportional Hazards Models; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Frailty; Menopause; Aged",depression; frailty; menopausal hormone therapy; premature menopause,"Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.; Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.; Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.

Cross-sectional study with linked electronic health records (EHRs). Primary care in England. 163 748 UK Biobank participants in England (aged 38-71 at baseline) with linked primary care EHRs. We compared the percentage of those self-reporting 'usually' having insomnia symptoms at UK Biobank baseline assessment (2006-2010) to those with a Read code for insomnia symptoms in their primary care records prior to baseline. We stratified prevalence in both groups by sociodemographic, lifestyle, sleep and health characteristics. We found that 29% of the sample self-reported having insomnia symptoms, while only 6% had a Read code for insomnia symptoms in their primary care records. Only 10% of self-reported cases had an insomnia symptom Read code, while 49% of primary care cases self-reported having insomnia symptoms. In both primary care and self-reported data, prevalence of insomnia symptom cases was highest in females, older participants and those with the lowest household incomes. However, while snorers and risk takers were more likely to be a primary care case, they were less likely to self-report insomnia symptoms than non-snorers and non-risk takers. Only a small proportion of individuals experiencing insomnia symptoms have an insomnia symptom Read code in their primary care record. However, primary care data do provide a clinically meaningful measure of insomnia prevalence. In addition, the sociodemographic characteristics of people attending primary care with insomnia were consistent with those with self-reported insomnia, thus primary care records are a valuable data source for studying risk factors for insomnia. Further studies should replicate our findings in other populations and examine ways to increase discussions about sleep health in primary care.","de Lange, Melanie A; Richmond, Rebecca C; Eastwood, Sophie V; Davies, Neil M",BMJ open,2024,Humans; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Female; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Middle Aged; Self Report; Primary Health Care; England; Aged; Adult; Prevalence; Electronic Health Records; UK Biobank,Electronic Health Records; Primary Health Care; SLEEP MEDICINE,"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK melanie.delange@bristol.ac.uk.; Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.; NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, London, UK.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.; Division of Psychiatry & Department of Statistical Sciences, University College London, London, UK.; K.G.

Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are national data for England that include contain ICD-10 diagnoses for inpatient mental healthcare episodes, but the validity of these diagnoses for research purposes has not been assessed. 250 peoples' HES records were selected based on a HES recorded inpatient stay at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, a wider schizophrenia spectrum disorder, bipolar affective disorder or unipolar depression. A gold-standard research diagnosis was made using Clinical Records Interactive Search pseudonymised electronic patient records using, and the OPCRIT+ algorithm. Positive predictive value at the level of lifetime psychiatric disorder was 100%, and at the level of lifetime diagnosis in the four categories of schizophrenia, wider schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar or unipolar depression was 73% (68-79). Agreement varied by diagnosis, with schizophrenia having the highest PPV at 90% (80-96). Each person had an average of five psychiatric HES records. An algorithm that looked at the last recorded psychiatric diagnosis led to greatest overall agreement with the research diagnosis. For people who have a HES record from a psychiatric admission with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder, bipolar affective disorder or unipolar depression, HES records appear to be a good indicator of a mental disorder, and can provide a diagnostic category with reasonable certainty.

UK Biobank,35731045,Prediction of type 2 diabetes mellitus onset using logistic regression-based scorecards.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for ~90% of all cases of diabetes, resulting in an estimated 6.7 million deaths in 2021, according to the International Diabetes Federation. Early detection of patients with high risk of developing T2D can reduce the incidence of the disease through a change in lifestyle, diet, or medication. Since populations of lower socio-demographic status are more susceptible to T2D and might have limited resources or access to sophisticated computational resources, there is a need for accurate yet accessible prediction models. In this study, we analyzed data from 44,709 nondiabetic UK Biobank participants aged 40-69, predicting the risk of T2D onset within a selected time frame (mean of 7.3 years with an SD of 2.3 years). We started with 798 features that we identified as potential predictors for T2D onset. We first analyzed the data using gradient boosting decision trees, survival analysis, and logistic regression methods. We devised one nonlaboratory model accessible to the general population and one more precise yet simple model that utilizes laboratory tests. We simplified both models to an accessible scorecard form, tested the models on normoglycemic and prediabetes subcohorts, and compared the results to the results of the general cohort. We established the nonlaboratory model using the following covariates: sex, age, weight, height, waist size, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and body mass index. For the laboratory model, we used age and sex together with four common blood tests: high-density lipoprotein (HDL), gamma-glutamyl transferase, glycated hemoglobin, and triglycerides. As an external validation dataset, we used the electronic medical record database of Clalit Health Services. The nonlaboratory scorecard model achieved an area under the receiver operating curve (auROC) of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.84) and an odds ratio (OR) between the upper and fifth prevalence deciles of 17.2 (95% CI 5-66). Using this model, we classified three risk groups, a group with 1% (0.8-1%), 5% (3-6%), and the third group with a 9% (7-12%) risk of developing T2D. We further analyzed the contribution of the laboratory-based model and devised a blood test model based on age, sex, and the four common blood tests noted above. In this scorecard model, we included age, sex, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c%), gamma glutamyl-transferase, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol. Using this model, we achieved an auROC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.85-0.90) and a deciles' OR of ×48 (95% CI 12-109). Using this model, we classified the cohort into four risk groups with the following risks: 0.5% (0.4-7%); 3% (2-4%); 10% (8-12%); and a high-risk group of 23% (10-37%) of developing T2D. When applying the blood tests model using the external validation cohort (Clalit), we achieved an auROC of 0.75 (95% CI 0.74-0.75). We analyzed several additional comprehensive models, which included genotyping data and other environmental factors. We found that these models did not provide cost-efficient benefits over the four blood test model. The commonly used German Diabetes Risk Score (GDRS) and Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) models, trained using our data, achieved an auROC of 0.73 (0.69-0.76) and 0.66 (0.62-0.70), respectively, inferior to the results achieved by the four blood test model and by the anthropometry models. The four blood test and anthropometric models outperformed the commonly used nonlaboratory models, the FINDRISC and the GDRS. We suggest that our models be used as tools for decision-makers to assess populations at elevated T2D risk and thus improve medical strategies. These models might also provide a personal catalyst for changing lifestyle, diet, or medication modifications to lower the risk of T2D onset.

UK Biobank,34086673,Novel EDGE encoding method enhances ability to identify genetic interactions.,"Assumptions are made about the genetic model of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) when choosing a traditional genetic encoding: additive, dominant, and recessive. Furthermore, SNPs across the genome are unlikely to demonstrate identical genetic models. However, running SNP-SNP interaction analyses with every combination of encodings raises the multiple testing burden. Here, we present a novel and flexible encoding for genetic interactions, the elastic data-driven genetic encoding (EDGE), in which SNPs are assigned a heterozygous value based on the genetic model they demonstrate in a dataset prior to interaction testing. We assessed the power of EDGE to detect genetic interactions using 29 combinations of simulated genetic models and found it outperformed the traditional encoding methods across 10%, 30%, and 50% minor allele frequencies (MAFs). Further, EDGE maintained a low false-positive rate, while additive and dominant encodings demonstrated inflation. We evaluated EDGE and the traditional encodings with genetic data from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network for five phenotypes: age-related macular degeneration (AMD), age-related cataract, glaucoma, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and resistant hypertension. A multi-encoding genome-wide association study (GWAS) for each phenotype was performed using the traditional encodings, and the top results of the multi-encoding GWAS were considered for SNP-SNP interaction using the traditional encodings and EDGE. EDGE identified a novel SNP-SNP interaction for age-related cataract that no other method identified: rs7787286 (MAF: 0.041; intergenic region of chromosome 7)-rs4695885 (MAF: 0.34; intergenic region of chromosome 4) with a Bonferroni LRT p of 0.018. A SNP-SNP interaction was found in data from the UK Biobank within 25 kb of these SNPs using the recessive encoding: rs60374751 (MAF: 0.030) and rs6843594 (MAF: 0.34) (Bonferroni LRT p: 0.026). We recommend using EDGE to flexibly detect interactions between SNPs exhibiting diverse action.","Hall, Molly A; Wallace, John; Lucas, Anastasia M; Bradford, Yuki; Verma, Shefali S; Müller-Myhsok, Bertram; Passero, Kristin; Zhou, Jiayan; McGuigan, John; Jiang, Beibei; Pendergrass, Sarah A; Zhang, Yanfei; Peissig, Peggy; Brilliant, Murray; Sleiman, Patrick; Hakonarson, Hakon; Harley, John B; Kiryluk, Krzysztof; Van Steen, Kristel; Moore, Jason H; Ritchie, Marylyn D",PLoS genetics,2021,"Cataract; Datasets as Topic; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Gene Frequency; Genome-Wide Association Study; Glaucoma; Humans; Hypertension; Macular Degeneration; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,"Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Agricultural Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Penn State Cancer Institute, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Agricultural Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Department of Genetics, Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Department of Genetics, Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Department of Genetics, Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Department of Translational Research in Psychiatry, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Munich, Germany.; Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology (SyNergy), Munich, Germany.; Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.; Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Agricultural Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, College of Agricultural Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Department of Translational Research in Psychiatry, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Munich, Germany.; Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology (SyNergy), Munich, Germany.; Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.; Genentech, San Francisco, California, United States of America.; Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger Health System, Danville, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Center for Precision Medicine Research, Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, Marshfield, Wisconsin, United States of America.; Center for Precision Medicine Research, Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, Marshfield, Wisconsin, United States of America.; Department of Pediatrics, Center for Applied Genomics, Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Department of Pediatrics, Center for Applied Genomics, Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology (CAGE), Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America.; United States Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America.; WELBIO, GIGA-R Medical Genomics-BIO3, University of Liège, Liège, Belgium.; Department of Human Genetics, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Department of Genetics, Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.; Department of Genetics, Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.",10.1371/journal.pgen.1009534
UK Biobank,36571484,Discovering comorbid diseases using an inter-disease interactivity network based on biobank-scale PheWAS data.,"Understanding comorbidity is essential for disease prevention, treatment and prognosis. In particular, insight into which pairs of diseases are likely or unlikely to co-occur may help elucidate the potential relationships between complex diseases. Here, we introduce the use of an inter-disease interactivity network to discover/prioritize comorbidities. Specifically, we determine disease associations by accounting for the direction of effects of genetic components shared between diseases, and categorize those associations as synergistic or antagonistic. We further develop a comorbidity scoring algorithm to predict whether diseases are more or less likely to co-occur in the presence of a given index disease. This algorithm can handle networks that incorporate relationships with opposite signs. We finally investigate inter-disease associations among 427 phenotypes in UK Biobank PheWAS data and predict the priority of comorbid diseases. The predicted comorbidities were verified using the UK Biobank inpatient electronic health records. Our findings demonstrate that considering the interaction of phenotype associations might be helpful in better predicting comorbidity.

UK Biobank,39875408,Bias-corrected serum creatinine from UK Biobank electronic medical records generates an important data resource for kidney function trajectories.,"Loss of kidney function is a substantial personal and public health burden. Kidney function is typically assessed as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on serum creatinine. UK Biobank provides serum creatinine measurements from study center assessments (SC, n = 425,147 baseline, n = 15,314 with follow-up) and emerging electronic Medical Records (eMR, ""GP-clinical"") present a promising resource to augment this data longitudinally. However, it is unclear whether eMR-based and SC-based creatinine values can be used jointly for research on eGFR decline. When comparing eMR-based with SC-based creatinine by calendar year (n = 70,231), we found a year-specific multiplicative bias for eMR-based creatinine that decreased over time (factor 0.84 for 2007, 0.97 for 2013). Deriving eGFR based on SC- and bias-corrected eMR-creatinine yielded 454,907 individuals with ≥ 1eGFR assessment (2,102,174 assessments). This included 206,063 individuals with ≥ 2 assessments over up to 60.2 years (median 6.00 assessments, median time = 8.7 years), where we also obtained eMR-based information on kidney disease or renal replacement therapy. We found an annual eGFR decline of 0.11 (95%-CI = 0.10-0.12) versus 1.04 mL/min/1.73m","Gorski, Mathias; Wiegrebe, Simon; Burkhardt, Ralph; Behr, Merle; Küchenhoff, Helmut; Stark, Klaus J; Böger, Carsten A; Heid, Iris M",Scientific reports,2025,Humans; Creatinine; Electronic Health Records; Glomerular Filtration Rate; United Kingdom; Male; Biological Specimen Banks; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Kidney; Kidney Function Tests; Kidney Diseases; Adult; Bias; UK Biobank,Epidemiology; Kidney; Medical Research; Nephrology,"Department of Genetic Epidemiology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.; Department of Genetic Epidemiology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.; Statistical Consulting Unit StaBLab, Department of Statistics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Munich, Germany.; Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.; Faculty of Informatics and Data Science, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.; Statistical Consulting Unit StaBLab, Department of Statistics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Munich, Germany.; Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML), Munich, Germany.; Department of Genetic Epidemiology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.; Department of Nephrology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.; Department of Nephrology, Diabetology and Rheumatology, Kliniken Südostbayern, Traunstein, Germany.; KfH Kidney Center Traunstein, Traunstein, Germany.; Department of Genetic Epidemiology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany. iris.heid@klinik.uni-regensburg.de.",10.1038/s41598-025-85391-7
UK Biobank,33819874,"Is neuroticism differentially associated with risk of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia?","This study examines whether neuroticism is differentially associated with risk of incident Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) using a prospective study design. Participants from the UK Biobank (N = 401,422) completed a self-report neuroticism scale in 2006-2010 and incident all-cause dementia, AD, VD, and FTD were ascertained using electronic health records or death records up to 2018. During an average follow-up of 8.8 years (3,566,123 person-years), there were 1798 incident of all-cause dementia, 675 AD, 376 VD, and 81 FTD. Accounting for age and sex, compared to individuals in the low quartile, individuals in the top quartile of neuroticism had higher risk of all-cause dementia (HR = 1.70; 95% CI: 1.49-1.93), AD (HR = 1.42; 1.15-1.75), VD (HR = 1.73; 1.30-2.29), but not FTD (HR = 0.89; 0.49-1.63). The associations with AD and VD were attenuated but remained significant after further accounting for education, household income, deprivation index, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart attack, ever smoker, physical activity, obesity, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive protein, and low-density lipoprotein. The associations were not moderated by socioeconomic status. The findings were consistent in analyses that excluded cases that occurred within the first 5 years of follow-up. In conclusion, neuroticism is a robust predictor of incident AD and VD, but not FTD. This pattern suggests that the affective symptoms that distinguish dementia types may partly reflect premorbid differences in trait neuroticism.","Terracciano, Antonio; Aschwanden, Damaris; Passamonti, Luca; Toschi, Nicola; Stephan, Yannick; Luchetti, Martina; Lee, Ji Hyun; Sesker, Amanda; O'Súilleabháin, Páraic S; Sutin, Angelina R",Journal of psychiatric research,2021,"Alzheimer Disease; Dementia, Vascular; Frontotemporal Dementia; Humans; Neuroticism; Prospective Studies",Alzheimer's disease; Emotional distress; Neurodegenerative disease; Personality; Pick's disease,"Florida State University College of Medicine, Tallahassee, FL, USA.

UK Biobank,38742457,To weight or not to weight? The effect of selection bias in 3 large electronic health record-linked biobanks and recommendations for practice.,"To develop recommendations regarding the use of weights to reduce selection bias for commonly performed analyses using electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobank data. We mapped diagnosis (ICD code) data to standardized phecodes from 3 EHR-linked biobanks with varying recruitment strategies: All of Us (AOU; n = 244 071), Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI; n = 81 243), and UK Biobank (UKB; n = 401 167). Using 2019 National Health Interview Survey data, we constructed selection weights for AOU and MGI to represent the US adult population more. We used weights previously developed for UKB to represent the UKB-eligible population. We conducted 4 common analyses comparing unweighted and weighted results. For AOU and MGI, estimated phecode prevalences decreased after weighting (weighted-unweighted median phecode prevalence ratio [MPR]: 0.82 and 0.61), while UKB estimates increased (MPR: 1.06). Weighting minimally impacted latent phenome dimensionality estimation. Comparing weighted versus unweighted phenome-wide association study for colorectal cancer, the strongest associations remained unaltered, with considerable overlap in significant hits. Weighting affected the estimated log-odds ratio for sex and colorectal cancer to align more closely with national registry-based estimates. Weighting had a limited impact on dimensionality estimation and large-scale hypothesis testing but impacted prevalence and association estimation. When interested in estimating effect size, specific signals from untargeted association analyses should be followed up by weighted analysis. EHR-linked biobanks should report recruitment and selection mechanisms and provide selection weights with defined target populations. Researchers should consider their intended estimands, specify source and target populations, and weight EHR-linked biobank analyses accordingly.","Salvatore, Maxwell; Kundu, Ritoban; Shi, Xu; Friese, Christopher R; Lee, Seunggeun; Fritsche, Lars G; Mondul, Alison M; Hanauer, David; Pearce, Celeste Leigh; Mukherjee, Bhramar",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024,Humans; Electronic Health Records; Biological Specimen Banks; Selection Bias; Female; Male; Adult; Middle Aged; Medical Record Linkage; United States; Aged; United Kingdom; Michigan,ICD codes; biobank; electronic health records; phenome; selection bias,"Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Rogel Cancer Center, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Center for Improving Patient and Population Health, School of Nursing, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Health Management and Policy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Graduate School of Data Science, Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Rogel Cancer Center, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Rogel Cancer Center, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Learning Health Sciences, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2054, United States.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Rogel Cancer Center, Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029, United States.",10.1093/jamia/ocae098
UK Biobank,40146917,"Biases in Race and Ethnicity Introduced by Filtering Electronic Health Records for ""Complete Data"": Observational Clinical Data Analysis.","Integrated clinical databases from national biobanks have advanced the capacity for disease research. Data quality and completeness filters are used when building clinical cohorts to address limitations of data missingness. However, these filters may unintentionally introduce systemic biases when they are correlated with race and ethnicity. In this study, we examined the race and ethnicity biases introduced by applying common filters to 4 clinical records databases. Specifically, we evaluated whether these filters introduce biases that disproportionately exclude minoritized groups. We applied 19 commonly used data filters to electronic health record datasets from 4 geographically varied locations comprising close to 12 million patients to understand how using these filters introduces sample bias along racial and ethnic groupings. These filters covered a range of information, including demographics, medication records, visit details, and observation periods. We observed the variation in sample drop-off between self-reported ethnic and racial groups for each site as we applied each filter individually. Applying the observation period filter substantially reduced data availability across all races and ethnicities in all 4 datasets. However, among those examined, the availability of data in the white group remained consistently higher compared to other racial groups after applying each filter. Conversely, the Black or African American group was the most impacted by each filter on these 3 datasets: Cedars-Sinai dataset, UK Biobank, and Columbia University dataset. Among the 4 distinct datasets, only applying the filters to the All of Us dataset resulted in minimal deviation from the baseline, with most racial and ethnic groups following a similar pattern. Our findings underscore the importance of using only necessary filters, as they might disproportionally affect data availability of minoritized racial and ethnic populations. Researchers must consider these unintentional biases when performing data-driven research and explore techniques to minimize the impact of these filters, such as probabilistic methods or adjusted cohort selection methods. Additionally, we recommend disclosing sample sizes for racial and ethnic groups both before and after data filters are applied to aid the reader in understanding the generalizability of the results. Future work should focus on exploring the effects of filters on downstream analyses.","Acitores Cortina, Jose Miguel; Fatapour, Yasaman; Brown, Kathleen LaRow; Gisladottir, Undina; Zietz, Michael; Bear Don't Walk Iv, Oliver John; Peter, Danner; Berkowitz, Jacob S; Friedrich, Nadine A; Kivelson, Sophia; Kuchi, Aditi; Liu, Hongyu; Srinivasan, Apoorva; Tsang, Kevin K; Tatonetti, Nicholas P",JMIR medical informatics,2025,"Humans; Electronic Health Records; Ethnicity; Racial Groups; Bias; Data Accuracy; Databases, Factual",data quality; electronic health records; health disparities; observational research; racial and ethnic biases,"Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 700 North San Vicente Boulevard, Pacific Design Center Suite G540, Los Angeles, CA, 90069, United States, 1 424 315 1031.; Cedars-Sinai Cancer, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.; Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States.",10.2196/67591

UK Biobank,33619467,A semi-supervised approach for rapidly creating clinical biomarker phenotypes in the UK Biobank using different primary care EHR and clinical terminology systems.,"The UK Biobank (UKB) is making primary care electronic health records (EHRs) for 500 000 participants available for COVID-19-related research. Data are extracted from four sources, recorded using five clinical terminologies and stored in different schemas. The aims of our research were to: (a) develop a semi-supervised approach for bootstrapping EHR phenotyping algorithms in UKB EHR, and (b) to evaluate our approach by implementing and evaluating phenotypes for 31 common biomarkers. We describe an algorithmic approach to phenotyping biomarkers in primary care EHR involving (a) bootstrapping definitions using existing phenotypes, (b) excluding generic, rare, or semantically distant terms, (c) forward-mapping terminology terms, (d) expert review, and (e) data extraction. We evaluated the phenotypes by assessing the ability to reproduce known epidemiological associations with all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards models. We created and evaluated phenotyping algorithms for 31 biomarkers many of which are directly related to COVID-19 complications, for example diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease. Our algorithm identified 1651 Read v2 and Clinical Terms Version 3 terms and automatically excluded 1228 terms. Clinical review excluded 103 terms and included 44 terms, resulting in 364 terms for data extraction (sensitivity 0.89, specificity 0.92). We extracted 38 190 682 events and identified 220 978 participants with at least one biomarker measured. Bootstrapping phenotyping algorithms from similar EHR can potentially address pre-existing methodological concerns that undermine the outputs of biomarker discovery pipelines and provide research-quality phenotyping algorithms.","Denaxas, Spiros; Shah, Anoop D; Mateen, Bilal A; Kuan, Valerie; Quint, Jennifer K; Fitzpatrick, Natalie; Torralbo, Ana; Fatemifar, Ghazaleh; Hemingway, Harry",JAMIA open,2020,,UK Biobank; electronic health records; medical informatics; phenotyping,"Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, University College London, London, UK.; The Alan Turing Institute, London UK.; British Heart Foundation Research Accelerator, University College London, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, University College London, London, UK.; The Alan Turing Institute, London UK.; King's College Hospital, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, University College London, London, UK.; British Heart Foundation Research Accelerator, University College London, London, UK.; Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, University College London, London, UK.; National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, University College London, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, University College London, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, University College London, London, UK.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.; Health Data Research UK, University College London, London, UK.; British Heart Foundation Research Accelerator, University College London, London, UK.",10.1093/jamiaopen/ooaa047
UK Biobank,34098570,Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Genetic Risk Factors for Spastic Cerebral Palsy.,"Although many clinical risk factors of spastic cerebral palsy (CP) have been identified, the genetic basis of spastic CP is largely unknown. Here, using whole-genome genetic information linked to a deidentified electronic health record (BioVU) with replication in the UK Biobank and FinnGen, we perform the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for spastic CP. To define the genetic basis of spastic CP. Whole-genome data were obtained using the multi-ethnic genotyping array (MEGA) genotyping array capturing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.01, and imputation quality score (r2) > 0.3, imputed based on the 1000 genomes phase 3 reference panel. Threshold for genome-wide significance was defined after Bonferroni correction for the total number of SNPs tested (P < 5.0 × 10-8). Replication analysis (defined as P < .05) was performed in the UK Biobank and FinnGen. We identify 1 SNP (rs78686911) reaching genome-wide significance with spastic CP. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis suggests that rs78686911 decreases expression of GRIK4, a gene that encodes a high-affinity kainate glutamatergic receptor of largely unknown function. Replication analysis in the UK Biobank and FinnGen reveals additional SNPs in the GRIK4 loci associated with CP. To our knowledge, we perform the first GWAS of spastic CP. Our study indicates that genetic variation contributes to CP risk.","Hale, Andrew T; Akinnusotu, Oluwatoyin; He, Jing; Wang, Janey; Hibshman, Natalie; Shannon, Chevis N; Naftel, Robert P",Neurosurgery,2021,"Cerebral Palsy; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors",Cerebral palsy; GWAS; Genetics; Spasticity,"Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Medical Scientist Training Program, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Surgical Outcomes Center for Kids, Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital of Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Division of Genetic Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Surgical Outcomes Center for Kids, Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital of Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Bioinformatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Bioinformatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Surgical Outcomes Center for Kids, Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital of Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Surgical Outcomes Center for Kids, Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital of Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Division of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital of Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Surgical Outcomes Center for Kids, Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital of Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.; Division of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Monroe Carell Jr Children's Hospital of Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.",10.1093/neuros/nyab184
UK Biobank,30610202,Significant shared heritability underlies suicide attempt and clinically predicted probability of attempting suicide.,"Suicide accounts for nearly 800,000 deaths per year worldwide with rates of both deaths and attempts rising. Family studies have estimated substantial heritability of suicidal behavior; however, collecting the sample sizes necessary for successful genetic studies has remained a challenge. We utilized two different approaches in independent datasets to characterize the contribution of common genetic variation to suicide attempt. The first is a patient reported suicide attempt phenotype asked as part of an online mental health survey taken by a subset of participants (n = 157,366) in the UK Biobank. After quality control, we leveraged a genotyped set of unrelated, white British ancestry participants including 2433 cases and 334,766 controls that included those that did not participate in the survey or were not explicitly asked about attempting suicide. The second leveraged electronic health record (EHR) data from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC, 2.8 million patients, 3250 cases) and machine learning to derive probabilities of attempting suicide in 24,546 genotyped patients. We identified significant and comparable heritability estimates of suicide attempt from both the patient reported phenotype in the UK Biobank (h","Ruderfer, Douglas M; Walsh, Colin G; Aguirre, Matthew W; Tanigawa, Yosuke; Ribeiro, Jessica D; Franklin, Joseph C; Rivas, Manuel A",Molecular psychiatry,2020,"Biological Specimen Banks; Electronic Health Records; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Health Surveys; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Mental Health; Phenotype; Probability; Risk Factors; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; Tennessee; United Kingdom; White People",,"Division of Genetic Medicine, Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. douglas.ruderfer@vanderbilt.edu.; Departments of Medicine, Psychiatry and Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. douglas.ruderfer@vanderbilt.edu.; Departments of Medicine, Psychiatry and Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.; Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Department of Psychology, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; Department of Psychology, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA.; Department of Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.",10.1038/s41380-018-0326-8
UK Biobank,33936514,Statistical Impact of Sample Size and Imbalance on Multivariate Analysis ,"Large-scale biobank cohorts coupled with electronic health records offer unprecedented opportunities to study genotype-phenotype relationships. Genome-wide association studies uncovered disease-associated loci through univariate methods, with the focus on one trait at a time. With genetic variants being identifiedfor thousands of traits, researchers found that 90% of human genetic loci are associated with more than one trait, highlighting the ubiquity of pleiotropy. Recently, multivariate methods have been proposed to effectively identify pleiotropy. However, the statistical performance in natural biomedical data, which often have unbalanced case-control sample sizes, is largely known. In this work, we designed 21 scenarios of real-data informed simulations to thoroughly evaluate the statistical characteristics of univariate and multivariate methods. Our results can serve as a reference guide for the application of multivariate methods. We also investigated potential pleiotropy across type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis of arteries, depression, and atherosclerotic heart disease in the UK Biobank.","Zhang, Xinyuan; Li, Ruowang; Ritchie, Marylyn D",AMIA ...

UK Biobank,31194742,Exploring various polygenic risk scores for skin cancer in the phenomes of the Michigan genomics initiative and the UK Biobank with a visual catalog: PRSWeb.,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are designed to serve as single summary measures that are easy to construct, condensing information from a large number of genetic variants associated with a disease. They have been used for stratification and prediction of disease risk. The primary focus of this paper is to demonstrate how we can combine PRS and electronic health records data to better understand the shared and unique genetic architecture and etiology of disease subtypes that may be both related and heterogeneous. PRS construction strategies often depend on the purpose of the study, the available data/summary estimates, and the underlying genetic architecture of a disease. We consider several choices for constructing a PRS using data obtained from various publicly-available sources including the UK Biobank and evaluate their abilities to predict not just the primary phenotype but also secondary phenotypes derived from electronic health records (EHR). This study was conducted using data from 30,702 unrelated, genotyped patients of recent European descent from the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a longitudinal biorepository effort within Michigan Medicine. We examine the three most common skin cancer subtypes in the USA: basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Using these PRS for various skin cancer subtypes, we conduct a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) within the MGI data to evaluate PRS associations with secondary traits. PheWAS results are then replicated using population-based UK Biobank data and compared across various PRS construction methods. We develop an accompanying visual catalog called PRSweb that provides detailed PheWAS results and allows users to directly compare different PRS construction methods.","Fritsche, Lars G; Beesley, Lauren J; VandeHaar, Peter; Peng, Robert B; Salvatore, Maxwell; Zawistowski, Matthew; Gagliano Taliun, Sarah A; Das, Sayantan; LeFaive, Jonathon; Kaleba, Erin O; Klumpner, Thomas T; Moser, Stephanie E; Blanc, Victoria M; Brummett, Chad M; Kheterpal, Sachin; Abecasis, Gonçalo R; Gruber, Stephen B; Mukherjee, Bhramar",PLoS genetics,2019,"Biological Specimen Banks; Electronic Health Records; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Genotype; Humans; Michigan; Multifactorial Inheritance; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Skin Neoplasms; United Kingdom",,"Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Division of Pain Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Division of Pain Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Division of Pain Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Central Biorepository, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Division of Pain Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Division of Pain Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Michigan Institute for Data Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.; University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.",10.1371/journal.pgen.1008202
UK Biobank,39919332,A systematic analysis of the contribution of genetics to multimorbidity and comparisons with primary care data.,"Multimorbidity, the presence of two or more conditions in one person, is common but studies are often limited to observational data and single datasets. We address this gap by integrating large-scale primary-care and genetic data from multiple studies to interrogate multimorbidity patterns and producing digital resources to support future research. We defined chronic, common, and heritable conditions in individuals aged ≥65 years, using two large primary-care databases [CPRD (UK) N = 2,425,014 and SIDIAP (Spain) N = 1,053,640], and estimated heritability using the same definitions in UK Biobank (N = 451,197). We used logistic regression to estimate the co-occurrence of pairs of conditions in the primary care data. Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to estimate genetic similarity between pairs of conditions. Meta-analyses were conducted across databases, and up to three sources of genetic data, for each pair of conditions. We classified pairs of conditions as across or within-domain based on the international classification of disease. We identified 72 chronic conditions, with 43.6% of 2546 pairs showing higher co-occurrence than chance in primary care and evidence of shared genetics. Many across-domain pairs exhibited substantial shared genetics (e.g., iron deficiency anaemia and peripheral arterial disease: genetic correlation R Most pairs of chronic conditions show evidence of shared genetics, and co-occurrence in primary care, suggesting shared mechanisms. The identified patterns of shared genetics, negative correlations and discordance between genetic and observational data provide a foundation for future multimorbidity research.

UK Biobank,27135409,Defining Disease Phenotypes in Primary Care Electronic Health Records by a Machine Learning Approach: A Case Study in Identifying Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"1) To use data-driven method to examine clinical codes (risk factors) of a medical condition in primary care electronic health records (EHRs) that can accurately predict a diagnosis of the condition in secondary care EHRs. 2) To develop and validate a disease phenotyping algorithm for rheumatoid arthritis using primary care EHRs. This study linked routine primary and secondary care EHRs in Wales, UK. A machine learning based scheme was used to identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis from primary care EHRs via the following steps: i) selection of variables by comparing relative frequencies of Read codes in the primary care dataset associated with disease case compared to non-disease control (disease/non-disease based on the secondary care diagnosis); ii) reduction of predictors/associated variables using a Random Forest method, iii) induction of decision rules from decision tree model. The proposed method was then extensively validated on an independent dataset, and compared for performance with two existing deterministic algorithms for RA which had been developed using expert clinical knowledge. Primary care EHRs were available for 2,238,360 patients over the age of 16 and of these 20,667 were also linked in the secondary care rheumatology clinical system. In the linked dataset, 900 predictors (out of a total of 43,100 variables) in the primary care record were discovered more frequently in those with versus those without RA. These variables were reduced to 37 groups of related clinical codes, which were used to develop a decision tree model. The final algorithm identified 8 predictors related to diagnostic codes for RA, medication codes, such as those for disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, and absence of alternative diagnoses such as psoriatic arthritis. The proposed data-driven method performed as well as the expert clinical knowledge based methods. Data-driven scheme, such as ensemble machine learning methods, has the potential of identifying the most informative predictors in a cost-effective and rapid way to accurately and reliably classify rheumatoid arthritis or other complex medical conditions in primary care EHRs.","Zhou, Shang-Ming; Fernandez-Gutierrez, Fabiola; Kennedy, Jonathan; Cooksey, Roxanne; Atkinson, Mark; Denaxas, Spiros; Siebert, Stefan; Dixon, William G; O'Neill, Terence W; Choy, Ernest; Sudlow, Cathie; Brophy, Sinead",PloS one,2016,"Algorithms; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Machine Learning; Primary Health Care",,"Institute of Life Science, College of Medicine, Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom.; Institute of Life Science, College of Medicine, Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom.; Institute of Life Science, College of Medicine, Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom.; Institute of Life Science, College of Medicine, Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom.; Institute of Life Science, College of Medicine, Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom.; UCL Institute of Health Informatics and Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, London, United Kingdom.; Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; Arthritis Research UK Centre for Epidemiology, Institute of Inflammation and Repair, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Arthritis Research UK Centre for Epidemiology, Institute of Inflammation and Repair, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.; Arthritis Research UK CREATE Centre and Welsh Arthritis Research Network, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.; Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Institute of Life Science, College of Medicine, Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom.",10.1371/journal.pone.0154515

Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses were performed using data from the Kaiser Permanente Research Board (KPRB) and the UK Biobank. ACL and PCL injury cases were identified based on electronic health records from KPRB and the UK Biobank. GWA analyses from both cohorts were tested for ACL and PCL injury using a logistic regression model adjusting for sex, height, weight, age at enrolment, and race/ethnicity using allele counts for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The data from the two GWA studies were combined in a meta-analysis. Candidate genes previously reported to show an association with ACL injury in athletes were also tested for association from the meta-analysis data from the KPRB and the UK Biobank GWA studies. There was a total of 2,214 cases of ACL and PCL injury and 519,869 controls within the two cohorts, with three loci demonstrating a genome-wide significant association in the meta-analysis:  Genetic markers in three novel loci in this study and one previously-studied candidate gene were identified as potential risk factors for ACL and PCL injury and deserve further validation and investigation of molecular mechanisms.

UK Biobank,34315717,Cross-sectional analysis of educational inequalities in primary prevention statin use in UK Biobank.,"Identify whether participants with lower education are less likely to report taking statins for primary cardiovascular prevention than those with higher education, but an equivalent increase in underlying cardiovascular risk. Using data from a large prospective cohort study, UK Biobank, we calculated a QRISK3 cardiovascular risk score for 472 097 eligible participants with complete data on self-reported educational attainment and statin use (55% female participants; mean age 56 years). We used logistic regression to explore the association between (i) QRISK3 score and (ii) educational attainment on self-reported statin use. We then stratified the association between QRISK3 score and statin use, by educational attainment to test for interactions. There was evidence of an interaction between QRISK3 score and educational attainment. Per unit increase in QRISK3 score, more educated individuals were more likely to report taking statins. In women with ≤7 years of schooling, a one unit increase in QRISK3 score was associated with a 7% higher odds of statin use (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.07).

UK Biobank,31285632,Genome-wide association study of peripheral artery disease in the Million Veteran Program.,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, the extent to which genetic factors increase risk for PAD is largely unknown. Using electronic health record data, we performed a genome-wide association study in the Million Veteran Program testing ~32 million DNA sequence variants with PAD (31,307 cases and 211,753 controls) across veterans of European, African and Hispanic ancestry. The results were replicated in an independent sample of 5,117 PAD cases and 389,291 controls from the UK Biobank. We identified 19 PAD loci, 18 of which have not been previously reported. Eleven of the 19 loci were associated with disease in three vascular beds (coronary, cerebral, peripheral), including LDLR, LPL and LPA, suggesting that therapeutic modulation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the lipoprotein lipase pathway or circulating lipoprotein(a) may be efficacious for multiple atherosclerotic disease phenotypes. Conversely, four of the variants appeared to be specific for PAD, including F5 p.R506Q, highlighting the pathogenic role of thrombosis in the peripheral vascular bed and providing genetic support for Factor Xa inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for PAD. Our results highlight mechanistic similarities and differences among coronary, cerebral and peripheral atherosclerosis and provide therapeutic insights.","Klarin, Derek; Lynch, Julie; Aragam, Krishna; Chaffin, Mark; Assimes, Themistocles L; Huang, Jie; Lee, Kyung Min; Shao, Qing; Huffman, Jennifer E; Natarajan, Pradeep; Arya, Shipra; Small, Aeron; Sun, Yan V; Vujkovic, Marijana; Freiberg, Matthew S; Wang, Lu; Chen, Jinbo; Saleheen, Danish; Lee, Jennifer S; Miller, Donald R; Reaven, Peter; Alba, Patrick R; Patterson, Olga V; DuVall, Scott L; Boden, William E; Beckman, Joshua A; Gaziano, J Michael; Concato, John; Rader, Daniel J; Cho, Kelly; Chang, Kyong-Mi; Wilson, Peter W F; O'Donnell, Christopher J; Kathiresan, Sekar; Tsao, Philip S; Damrauer, Scott M",Nature medicine,2019,"Aged; Cholesterol, LDL; Factor V; Factor Xa Inhibitors; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Middle Aged; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Receptors, LDL; Veterans",,"Boston VA Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure, Department of Veterans Affairs, Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, CT, USA.; University of Massachusetts College of Nursing & Health Sciences, Boston, MA, USA.; Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research, Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial VA Hospital, Bedford, MA, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.; VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure, Department of Veterans Affairs, Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, CT, USA.; Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research, Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial VA Hospital, Bedford, MA, USA.; Department of Health Law, Policy & Management, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.; Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research, Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial VA Hospital, Bedford, MA, USA.; Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.; Boston VA Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA, USA.; Department of Surgery, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.; Corporal Michael J.

UK Biobank,31859414,"The emerging landscape of health research based on biobanks linked to electronic health records: Existing resources, statistical challenges, and potential opportunities.","Biobanks linked to electronic health records provide rich resources for health-related research. With improvements in administrative and informatics infrastructure, the availability and utility of data from biobanks have dramatically increased. In this paper, we first aim to characterize the current landscape of available biobanks and to describe specific biobanks, including their place of origin, size, and data types. The development and accessibility of large-scale biorepositories provide the opportunity to accelerate agnostic searches, expedite discoveries, and conduct hypothesis-generating studies of disease-treatment, disease-exposure, and disease-gene associations. Rather than designing and implementing a single study focused on a few targeted hypotheses, researchers can potentially use biobanks' existing resources to answer an expanded selection of exploratory questions as quickly as they can analyze them. However, there are many obvious and subtle challenges with the design and analysis of biobank-based studies. Our second aim is to discuss statistical issues related to biobank research such as study design, sampling strategy, phenotype identification, and missing data. We focus our discussion on biobanks that are linked to electronic health records. Some of the analytic issues are illustrated using data from the Michigan Genomics Initiative and UK Biobank, two biobanks with two different recruitment mechanisms. We summarize the current body of literature for addressing these challenges and discuss some standing open problems. This work complements and extends recent reviews about biobank-based research and serves as a resource catalog with analytical and practical guidance for statisticians, epidemiologists, and other medical researchers pursuing research using biobanks.","Beesley, Lauren J; Salvatore, Maxwell; Fritsche, Lars G; Pandit, Anita; Rao, Arvind; Brummett, Chad; Willer, Cristen J; Lisabeth, Lynda D; Mukherjee, Bhramar",Statistics in medicine,2020,Biological Specimen Banks; Electronic Health Records; Genomics; Michigan; Research Design,Michigan Genomics Initiative; UK Biobank; biobanks; electronic health records; selection bias,"Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Department of Anesthesiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.",10.1002/sim.8445
UK Biobank,37961657,Machine Learning Enables Single-Score Assessment of MASLD Presence and Severity.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) affects 30% of the global population but is often underdiagnosed. To fill this diagnostic gap, we developed a digital score reflecting presence and severity of MASLD. We fitted a machine learning model to electronic health records from 37,212 UK Biobank participants with proton density fat fraction measurements and/or a MASLD diagnosis to generate a ""MASLD score"". In holdout testing, our model achieved areas under the receiver-operating curve of 0.83-0.84 for MASLD diagnosis and 0.90-0.91 for identifying MASLD-associated advanced fibrosis. MASLD score was significantly associated with MASLD risk factors, progression to cirrhosis, and mortality. External testing in 252,725 diverse American participants demonstrated consistent results, and hepatologist chart review showed MASLD score identified probable MASLD underdiagnosis. The MASLD score could improve early diagnosis and intervention of chronic liver disease by providing a non-invasive, low-cost method for population-wide screening of MASLD.","Chen, Robert; Petrazzini, Ben Omega; Nadkarni, Girish; Rocheleau, Ghislain; Bansal, Meena; Do, Ron",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2023,,,"The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Medical Scientist Training Program, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Genomic Data Analytics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Genomic Data Analytics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Division of Hepatology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Genomic Data Analytics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.",10.1101/2023.10.24.23297423
UK Biobank,37523034,Utilizing multimodal approach to identify candidate pathways and biomarkers and predicting frailty syndrome in individuals from UK Biobank.,"Frailty, a prevalent clinical syndrome in aging adults, is characterized by poor health outcomes, represented via a standardized frailty-phenotype (FP), and Frailty Index (FI). While the relevance of the syndrome is gaining awareness, much remains unclear about its underlying biology. Further elucidation of the genetic determinants and possible underlying mechanisms may help improve patients' outcomes allowing healthy aging.Genotype, clinical and demographic data of subjects (aged 60-73 years) from UK Biobank were utilized. FP was defined on Fried's criteria. FI was calculated using electronic-health-records. Genome-wide-association-studies (GWAS) were conducted and polygenic-risk-scores (PRS) were calculated for both FP and FI. Functional analysis provided interpretations of underlying biology. Finally, machine-learning (ML) models were trained using clinical, demographic and PRS towards identifying frail from non-frail individuals.Thirty-one loci were significantly associated with FI accounting for 12% heritability. Seventeen of those were known associations for body-mass-index, coronary diseases, cholesterol-levels, and longevity, while the rest were novel. Significant genes CDKN2B and APOE, previously implicated in aging, were reported to be enriched in lipoprotein-particle-remodeling. Linkage-disequilibrium-regression identified specific regulation in limbic-system, associated with long-term memory and cognitive-function. XGboost was established as the best performing ML model with area-under-curve as 85%, sensitivity and specificity as 0.75 and 0.8, respectively.This study provides novel insights into increased vulnerability and risk stratification of frailty syndrome via a multi-modal approach. The findings suggest frailty as a highly polygenic-trait, enriched in cholesterol-remodeling and metabolism and to be genetically associated with cognitive abilities.

UK Biobank,37986972,MSGene: Derivation and validation of a multistate model for lifetime risk of coronary artery disease using genetic risk and the electronic health record.,"Currently, coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death among adults worldwide. Accurate risk stratification can support optimal lifetime prevention. We designed a novel and general multistate model (MSGene) to estimate age-specific transitions across 10 cardiometabolic states, dependent on clinical covariates and a CAD polygenic risk score. MSGene supports decision making about CAD prevention related to any of these states. We analyzed longitudinal data from 480,638 UK Biobank participants and compared predicted lifetime risk with the 30-year Framingham risk score. MSGene improved discrimination (C-index 0.71 vs 0.66), age of high-risk detection (C-index 0.73 vs 0.52), and overall prediction (RMSE 1.1% vs 10.9%), with external validation. We also used MSGene to refine estimates of lifetime absolute risk reduction from statin initiation. Our findings underscore the potential public health value of our novel multistate model for accurate lifetime CAD risk estimation using clinical factors and increasingly available genetics.","Urbut, Sarah M; Yeung, Ming Wai; Khurshid, Shaan; Cho, So Mi Jemma; Schuermans, Art; German, Jakob; Taraszka, Kodi; Fahed, Akl C; Ellinor, Patrick; Trinquart, Ludovic; Parmigiani, Giovanni; Gusev, Alexander; Natarajan, Pradeep",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2023,,,"Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.; University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Cardiology, 9700 RB Groningen, The Netherlands.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.; Demoulas Center for Cardiac Arrhythmias, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.; Integrative Research Center for Cerebrovascular and Cardiovascular Diseases, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.; Faculty of Medicine, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.; Demoulas Center for Cardiac Arrhythmias, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.; Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.; Tufts University Medical Center, Boston, MA.; Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.; Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA.; Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.",10.1101/2023.11.08.23298229
UK Biobank,35183688,A hypothesis-driven study to comprehensively investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in EPHX2 gene and cardiovascular diseases: Findings from the UK Biobank.,"Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are protective factors against cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) because of their vasodilatory, cholesterol-lowering, and anti-inflammatory effects. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), encoded by the EPHX2 gene, degrades EETs into less biologically active metabolites. EPHX2 is highly polymorphic, and genetic polymorphisms in EPHX2 have been linked to various types of CVDs, such as coronary heart disease, essential hypertension, and atrial fibrillation recurrence. Based on a priori hypothesis that EPHX2 genetic polymorphisms play an important role in the pathogenesis of CVDs, we comprehensively investigated the associations between 210 genetic polymorphisms in the EPHX2 gene and an array of 118 diseases in the circulatory system using a large sample from the UK Biobank (N = 307,516). The diseases in electronic health records were mapped to the phecode system, which was more representative of independent phenotypes. Survival analyses were employed to examine the effects of EPHX2 variants on CVD incidence, and a phenome-wide association study was conducted to study the impact of EPHX2 polymorphisms on 62 traits, including blood pressure, blood lipid levels, and inflammatory indicators. A novel association between the intronic variant rs116932590 and the phenotype ""aneurysm and dissection of heart"" was identified. In addition, the rs149467044 and rs200286838 variants showed nominal evidence of association with arterial aneurysm and cerebrovascular disease, respectively. Furthermore, the variant rs751141, which was linked with a lower hydrolase activity of sEH, was significantly associated with metabolic traits, including blood levels of triglycerides, creatinine, and urate. Multiple novel associations observed in the present study highlight the important role of EPHX2 genetic variation in the pathogenesis of CVDs.","Zhu, Xiaoming; Li, Yuxin; Yu, Tingting; Li, Sen; Chen, Mulei",Gene,2022,"Adult; Aged; Biological Specimen Banks; Cardiovascular Diseases; Electronic Health Records; Epoxide Hydrolases; Female; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Phenomics; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; United Kingdom",Cardiovascular diseases; EPHX2; Genetic polymorphisms; PheWAS; Soluble epoxide hydrolase,"Heart Center and Beijing Key Laboratory of Hypertension, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.

UK Biobank,37293013,Uncovering genetic associations in the human diseasome using an endophenotype-augmented disease network.,"Many diseases exhibit complex multimorbidities with one another. An intuitive way to model the connections between phenotypes is with a disease-disease network (DDN), where nodes represent diseases and edges represent associations, such as shared single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), between pairs of diseases. To gain further genetic understanding of molecular contributors to disease associations, we propose a novel version of the shared-SNP DDN (ssDDN), denoted as ssDDN+, which includes connections between diseases derived from genetic correlations with endophenotypes. We hypothesize that a ssDDN+ can provide complementary information to the disease connections in a ssDDN, yielding insight into the role of clinical laboratory measurements in disease interactions. Using PheWAS summary statistics from the UK Biobank, we constructed a ssDDN+ revealing hundreds of genetic correlations between disease phenotypes and quantitative traits. Our augmented network uncovers genetic associations across different disease categories, connects relevant cardiometabolic diseases, and highlights specific biomarkers that are associated with cross-phenotype associations. Out of the 31 clinical measurements under consideration, HDL-C connects the greatest number of diseases and is strongly associated with both type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy. Triglycerides, another blood lipid with known genetics causes in non-mendelian diseases, also adds a substantial number of edges to the ssDDN. Our study can facilitate future network-based investigations of cross-phenotype associations involving pleiotropy and genetic heterogeneity, potentially uncovering sources of missing heritability in multimorbidities.","Woerner, Jakob; Sriram, Vivek; Nam, Yonghyun; Verma, Anurag; Kim, Dokyoon",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2023,,PheWAS; complex diseases; disease-disease network; electronic health records; endophenotypes; genetic correlation; network medicine; pleiotropy,"Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Genomics and Computational Biology Graduate Group, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Genomics and Computational Biology Graduate Group, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.",10.1101/2023.05.11.23289852

The goal of this paper was to develop and perform an initial evaluation of maps from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes to phecodes. We mapped ICD-10 and ICD-10-CM codes to phecodes using a number of methods and resources, such as concept relationships and explicit mappings from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Unified Medical Language System, Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms, and the National Library of Medicine. We assessed the coverage of the maps in two databases: Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) using ICD-10-CM and the UK Biobank (UKBB) using ICD-10. We assessed the fidelity of the ICD-10-CM map in comparison to the gold-standard ICD-9-CM phecode map by investigating phenotype reproducibility and conducting a PheWAS. We mapped >75% of ICD-10 and ICD-10-CM codes to phecodes. Of the unique codes observed in the UKBB (ICD-10) and VUMC (ICD-10-CM) cohorts, >90% were mapped to phecodes. We observed 70-75% reproducibility for chronic diseases and <10% for an acute disease for phenotypes sourced from the ICD-10-CM phecode map. Using the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM maps, we conducted a PheWAS with a Lipoprotein(a) genetic variant, rs10455872, which replicated two known genotype-phenotype associations with similar effect sizes: coronary atherosclerosis (ICD-9-CM: P<.001; odds ratio (OR) 1.60 [95% CI 1.43-1.80] vs ICD-10-CM: P<.001; OR 1.60 [95% CI 1.43-1.80]) and chronic ischemic heart disease (ICD-9-CM: P<.001; OR 1.56 [95% CI 1.35-1.79] vs ICD-10-CM: P<.001; OR 1.47 [95% CI 1.22-1.77]). This study introduces the beta versions of ICD-10 and ICD-10-CM to phecode maps that enable researchers to leverage accumulated ICD-10 and ICD-10-CM data for PheWAS in the EHR.","Wu, Patrick; Gifford, Aliya; Meng, Xiangrui; Li, Xue; Campbell, Harry; Varley, Tim; Zhao, Juan; Carroll, Robert; Bastarache, Lisa; Denny, Joshua C; Theodoratou, Evropi; Wei, Wei-Qi",JMIR medical informatics,2019,,data science; electronic health record; genome-wide association study; medical informatics applications; phenome-wide association study; phenotyping,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; Medical Scientist Training Program, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Public Health and Intelligence Strategic Business Unit, National Services Scotland, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.; Centre for Global Health Research, Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.",10.2196/14325

UK Biobank,38523305,Clinical spectrum of Transthyretin amyloidogenic mutations among diverse population origins.,"Coding mutations in the Transthyretin (TTR) gene cause a hereditary form of amyloidosis characterized by a complex genotype-phenotype correlation with limited information regarding differences among worldwide populations. We compared 676 diverse individuals carrying TTR amyloidogenic mutations (rs138065384, Phe44Leu; rs730881165, Ala81Thr; rs121918074, His90Asn; rs76992529, Val122Ile) to 12,430 non-carriers matched by age, sex, and genetically-inferred ancestry to assess their clinical presentations across 1,693 outcomes derived from electronic health records in UK biobank. In individuals of African descent (AFR), Val122Ile mutation was linked to multiple outcomes related to the circulatory system (fold-enrichment = 2.96, p = 0.002) with the strongest associations being cardiac congenital anomalies (phecode 747.1, p = 0.003), endocarditis (phecode 420.3, p = 0.006), and cardiomyopathy (phecode 425, p = 0.007). In individuals of Central-South Asian descent (CSA), His90Asn mutation was associated with dermatologic outcomes (fold-enrichment = 28, p = 0.001). The same TTR mutation was linked to neoplasms in European-descent individuals (EUR, fold-enrichment = 3.09, p = 0.003). In EUR, Ala81Thr showed multiple associations with respiratory outcomes related (fold-enrichment = 3.61, p = 0.002), but the strongest association was with atrioventricular block (phecode 426.2, p = 2.81 × 10 Overall, these findings highlight that TTR amyloidogenic mutations present ancestry-specific and ancestry-convergent associations related to a range of health domains. This supports the need to increase awareness regarding the range of outcomes associated with TTR mutations across worldwide populations to reduce misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of TTR-related amyloidosis.","De Lillo, Antonella; Pathak, Gita A; Low, Aislinn; De Angelis, Flavio; Abou Alaiwi, Sarah; Miller, Edward J; Fuciarelli, Maria; Polimanti, Renato",Human genomics,2024,"Humans; Prealbumin; Mutation; Amyloidosis; Phenotype; Genetics, Population",Disease associations; Diversity; Electronic health records; TTR amyloidosis,"Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, 60 Temple, Suite 7A, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA.; Department of Biology, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, 60 Temple, Suite 7A, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA.; VA CT Healthcare Center, West Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, 60 Temple, Suite 7A, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA.; VA CT Healthcare Center, West Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, 60 Temple, Suite 7A, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA.; Department of Physical and Mental Health, and Preventive Medicine, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.; Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.; Department of Biology, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, 60 Temple, Suite 7A, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA. renato.polimanti@yale.edu.; VA CT Healthcare Center, West Haven, CT, USA. renato.polimanti@yale.edu.; Wu Tsai Institute, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA. renato.polimanti@yale.edu.",10.1186/s40246-024-00596-7
UK Biobank,32492095,Association of OPRM1 Functional Coding Variant With Opioid Use Disorder: A Genome-Wide Association Study.,"With the current opioid crisis, it is important to improve understanding of the biological mechanisms of opioid use disorder (OUD). To detect genetic risk variants for OUD and determine genetic correlations and causal association with OUD and other traits. A genome-wide association study of electronic health record-defined OUD in the Million Veteran Program sample was conducted, comprising 8529 affected European American individuals and 71 200 opioid-exposed European American controls (defined by electronic health record trajectory analysis) and 4032 affected African American individuals and 26 029 opioid-exposed African American controls. Participants were enrolled from January 10, 2011, to May 21, 2018, with electronic health record data for OUD diagnosis from October 1, 1999, to February 7, 2018. Million Veteran Program results and additional OUD case-control genome-wide association study results from the Yale-Penn and Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment samples were meta-analyzed (total numbers: European American individuals, 10 544 OUD cases and 72 163 opioid-exposed controls; African American individuals, 5212 cases and 26 876 controls). Data on Yale-Penn participants were collected from February 14, 1999, to April 1, 2017, and data on Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment participants were collected from 1990 to 2007. The key result was replicated in 2 independent cohorts: proxy-phenotype buprenorphine treatment in the UK Biobank and newly genotyped Yale-Penn participants. Genetic correlations between OUD and other traits were tested, and mendelian randomization analysis was conducted to identify potential causal associations. Main outcomes were International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision-diagnosed OUD or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision-diagnosed OUD (Million Veteran Program), and DSM-IV-defined opioid dependence (Yale-Penn and Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment). A total of 114 759 individuals (101 016 men [88%]; mean [SD] age, 60.1 [12.8] years) were included. In 82 707 European American individuals, a functional coding variant (rs1799971, encoding Asn40Asp) in OPRM1 (μ-opioid receptor gene, the main biological target for opioid drugs; OMIM 600018) reached genome-wide significance (G allele: β = -0.066 [SE = 0.012]; P = 1.51 × 10-8). The finding was replicated in 2 independent samples. Single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability of OUD was 11.3% (SE = 1.8%). Opioid use disorder was genetically correlated with 83 traits, including multiple substance use traits, psychiatric illnesses, cognitive performance, and others. Mendelian randomization analysis revealed the following associations with OUD: risk of tobacco smoking, depression, neuroticism, worry neuroticism subcluster, and cognitive performance. No genome-wide significant association was detected for African American individuals or in transpopulation meta-analysis. This genome-wide meta-analysis identified a significant association of OUD with an OPRM1 variant, which was replicated in 2 independent samples. Post-genome-wide association study analysis revealed associated pleiotropic characteristics. Recruitment of additional individuals with OUD for future studies-especially those of non-European ancestry-is a crucial next step in identifying additional significant risk loci.","Zhou, Hang; Rentsch, Christopher T; Cheng, Zhongshan; Kember, Rachel L; Nunez, Yaira Z; Sherva, Richard M; Tate, Janet P; Dao, Cecilia; Xu, Ke; Polimanti, Renato; Farrer, Lindsay A; Justice, Amy C; Kranzler, Henry R; Gelernter, Joel",JAMA psychiatry,2020,"Aged; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Opioid-Related Disorders; Receptors, Opioid, mu; United States; United States Department of Veterans Affairs",,"Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Psychiatry, Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven.; Department of Psychiatry, Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven.; Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Psychiatry, Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven.; Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Crescenz Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Psychiatry, Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven.; Department of Medicine (Biomedical Genetics), Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Psychiatry, Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven.; Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Psychiatry, Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven.; Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Psychiatry, Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Psychiatry, Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven.; Department of Medicine (Biomedical Genetics), Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Ophthalmology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Psychiatry, Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven.; Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, Connecticut.; Crescenz Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia.; Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Psychiatry, Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven.; Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.; Department of Neuroscience, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.",10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.1206

UK Biobank,37279959,Associations of Serum 25(OH)D With Risk of Recurrent Cardiovascular Events in Individuals With Coronary Heart Disease.,"Few studies have examined the relationship between vitamin D and the risk of recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events in people with coronary heart disease (CHD). This study aimed to investigate the associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms with the risk of recurrent CV events in individuals with established CHD. A total of 22 571 participants with CHD were included from the UK Biobank. Recurrent CV events, including myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and CV disease mortality, were identified from electronic health records. Cox proportional-hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. The median (interquartile range) of serum 25(OH)D concentration was 44.8 nmol/L (range, 30.3-61.4 nmol/L), and 58.6% of participants had 25(OH)D below 50 nmol/L. During a median follow-up of 11.2 years, a total of 3998 recurrent CV events were documented. After multivariable adjustment, there was a nonlinear inverse relationship between serum 25(OH)D and recurrent CV events (P nonlinearity <.01), and the decreasing risk gradually leveled off at around 50 nmol/L. Compared with participants with serum 25(OH)D less than 25.0 nmol/L, the HRs (95% CIs) for participants with serum 25(OH)D of 50.0 to 74.9 nmol/L were 0.64 (0.58-0.71) for recurrent CV events, 0.78 (0.65-0.94) for MI, 0.66 (0.57-0.76) for HF, and 0.66 (0.52-0.84) for stroke. In addition, these associations were not modified by genetic variants in the VDR. In people with established CHD, higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations were nonlinearly associated with a lower risk of recurrent CV events, with a potential threshold around 50 nmol/L. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining adequate vitamin D status in the prevention of recurrent CV events among individuals with CHD.","Lin, Xiaoyu; Chen, Xue; Liu, Sen; Deng, Yulei; Wang, Yuexuan; Lu, Qi; Li, Rui; Ou, Yunjing; Tian, Qingying; Liao, Yunfei; Cui, Guanglin; Yang, Kun; Pan, An; Liu, Gang",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2023,Humans; Vitamin D; Vitamin D Deficiency; Coronary Disease; Myocardial Infarction; Stroke; Vitamins; Risk Factors,cohort study; coronary heart disease; recurrent cardiovascular events; vitamin D,"Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety (Huazhong University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety (Huazhong University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety (Huazhong University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.; Department of Geriatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.; Department of Applied Statistics, Johannes Kepler Universität Linz, Linz 4040, Austria.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety (Huazhong University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety (Huazhong University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety (Huazhong University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety (Huazhong University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.; Department of Endocrinology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.; Department of Cardiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.; Department of Endocrinology, Affiliated Dongfeng Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan 442008, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety (Huazhong University of Science and Technology), Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.",10.1210/clinem/dgad339
UK Biobank,40542146,A survey of pathogenic involvement in non-communicable human diseases.,"Many relationships between pathogens and human disease are well-established. However, only a small fraction involve diseases considered non-communicable (NCDs). In this study, we sought to leverage the vast amount of newly available electronic health record data to identify potentially novel pathogen-NCD associations and find additional evidence supporting known associations. We leverage data from The UK Biobank and TriNetX to perform a systematic survey across 20 pathogens and 426 diseases, primarily NCDs. To this end, we assess the association between disease status and infection history proxies using a logistic regression-based statistical approach. Our approach identifies 206 pathogen-disease pairs that replicate in both cohorts. We replicate many established relationships, including Helicobacter pylori, with several gastroenterological diseases and connections between Epstein-Barr virus and both multiple sclerosis and lupus. Overall, our approach identifies evidence of association for 15 pathogens and 96 distinct diseases, including a currently controversial link between human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and ulcerative colitis (UC). We validate the CMV-UC connection through two orthogonal analyses, revealing increased CMV gene expression in UC patients and enrichment for UC genetic risk signal near human genes that have altered expression upon CMV infection. Collectively, these results form a foundation for future investigations into mechanistic roles played by pathogens in the processes underlying NCDs. All results are easily accessible on our website, https://tf.cchmc.org/pathogen-disease . Pathogens can hide in our bodies for years after initial infection. For example, the chickenpox virus can cause shingles decades after infection. Likewise, certain pathogens may contribute to the development or severity of subsequent conditions that are not contagious, referred to as non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Our study analyzed a vast number of electronic medical records to discover potential pathogen-NCD connections. We identified 206 such links. Future research based on these findings could revolutionize healthcare by enabling the development of vaccines targeted against these pathogens. For example, approaches similar to the introduction of the human papillomavirus vaccine which has led to declining cervical cancer rates. The development of vaccines for the pathogens identified in this study could potentially enable dramatic reductions in the NCDs linked to these pathogens.","Lape, Michael; Schnell, Daniel; Parameswaran, Sreeja; Ernst, Kevin; O'Connor, Shannon; Salomonis, Nathan; Martin, Lisa J; Harnett, Brett M; Kottyan, Leah C; Weirauch, Matthew T",Communications medicine,2025,,,"Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Division of Rheumatology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.; Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.

UK Biobank,39332922,Smoking and the Risk of Second Primary Lung Cancer Among Breast Cancer Survivors from the Population-Based UK Biobank Study.,"Long-term breast cancer (BC) survivors are known to develop second malignancies, with second primary lung cancer (SPLC) one common type. Smoking was identified as a main risk factor for SPLC among BC survivors. These findings were limited to the U.S. and focused on smoking status, not incorporating cumulative smoking exposures (eg, pack-years). We examine SPLC incidence and evaluate the associations between SPLC risk and cumulative cigarette smoking exposures and other potential factors among BC survivors in a prospective European cohort. Of 502,505 participants enrolled in the UK Biobank in 2006 to 2010, we identified 8429 patients diagnosed with BC between 2006 and 2016 and followed for second malignancies through 2016. Smoking information was collected at enrollment, and treatment data were collected using electronic health records. Multivariable cause-specific Cox regression (CSC) evaluated the association between each factor and SPLC risk. Of 8429 BC patients, 40 (0.47%) developed SPLC over 45,376 person-years. The 10-year cumulative SPLC incidence was 0.48% (95% CI = 0.33%-0.62%). The CSC analysis confirmed the association between SPLC and ever-smoking status (adjusted hazard-ratio (aHR) = 3.46 (P < .001). The analysis showed a 24% increment in SPLC risk per 10 smoking pack-years among BC survivors (aHR = 1.24 per-10 pack-years, P = .01).

UK Biobank,32918088,Associations of BMI and Serum Urate with Developing Dementia: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"Recent studies have suggested that a higher body mass index (BMI) and serum urate levels were associated with a lower risk of developing dementia. However, these reverse relationships remain controversial, and whether serum urate and BMI confound each other is not well established. To investigate the independent associations of BMI and urate, as well as their interaction with the risk of developing dementia. We analyzed a cohort of 502 528 individuals derived from the UK Biobank that included people aged 37-73 years for whom BMI and urate were recorded between 2006 and 2010. Dementia was ascertained at follow-up using electronic health records. During a median of 8.1 years of follow-up, a total of 2138 participants developed dementia. People who were underweight had an increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-2.97) compared with people of a healthy weight. However, the risk of dementia continued to fall as weight increased, as those who were overweight and obese were 19% (HR = 0.81, 95%: 0.73-0.90) and 22% (HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.68-0.88) were less likely to develop dementia than people of a healthy weight. People in the highest quintile of urate were also associated with a 25% (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.64-0.87) reduction in the risk of developing dementia compared with those who were in the lowest quintile. There was a significant multiplicative interaction between BMI and urate in relation to dementia (P for interaction = 0.004), and obesity strengthens the protective effect of serum urate on the risk of dementia. Both BMI and urate are independent predictors of dementia, and there are inverse monotonic and dose-response associations of BMI and urate with dementia.","Cao, Zhi; Xu, Chenjie; Yang, Hongxi; Li, Shu; Xu, Fusheng; Zhang, Yuan; Wang, Yaogang",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2020,Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Cohort Studies; Dementia; Disease Progression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prodromal Symptoms; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; United Kingdom; Uric Acid,BMI; cohort study; dementia; obesity; serum urate,"School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.; School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.; School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.; School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.; School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.; School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.; School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.",10.1210/clinem/dgaa638
UK Biobank,36350801,HCLC-FC: A novel statistical method for phenome-wide association studies.,"The emergence of genetic data coupled to longitudinal electronic medical records (EMRs) offers the possibility of phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). In PheWAS, the whole phenome can be divided into numerous phenotypic categories according to the genetic architecture across phenotypes. Currently, statistical analyses for PheWAS are mainly univariate analyses, which test the association between one genetic variant and one phenotype at a time. In this article, we derived a novel and powerful multivariate method for PheWAS. The proposed method involves three steps. In the first step, we apply the bottom-up hierarchical clustering method to partition a large number of phenotypes into disjoint clusters within each phenotypic category. In the second step, the clustering linear combination method is used to combine test statistics within each category based on the phenotypic clusters and obtain p-values from each phenotypic category. In the third step, we propose a new false discovery rate (FDR) control approach. We perform extensive simulation studies to compare the performance of our method with that of other existing methods. The results show that our proposed method controls FDR very well and outperforms other methods we compared with. We also apply the proposed approach to a set of EMR-based phenotypes across more than 300,000 samples from the UK Biobank. We find that the proposed approach not only can well-control FDR at a nominal level but also successfully identify 1,244 significant SNPs that are reported to be associated with some phenotypes in the GWAS catalog.

A total of 416 220 participants from the UK Biobank were included in this prospective cohort study. Fried phenotype was adopted to evaluate frailty, which included 5 aspects (gait speed, physical activity, grip strength, exhaustion, and weight). More than 800 infectious diseases were identified based on electronic health records. Cox proportional models were used to estimate the associations. During a median 12.3 years (interquartile range 11.4-13.2) of follow-up (4 747 345 person-years), there occurred 77 988 (18.7%) hospital-treated infections cases. In the fully adjusted model, compared with participants with nonfrail, the hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of those with prefrail and frail for overall hospital-treated infections were 1.22 (1.20, 1.24) and 1.78 (1.72-1.84), respectively. The attributable risk proportion of prefrail and frail were 18.03% and 43.82%. Similarly, compared to those without frailty, the HRs (95% CIs) of those with frailty for bacterial infections were 1.76 (1.70-1.83), for viral infections were 1.62 (1.44-1.82), and for fungal infections were 1.75 (1.47-2.08). No association was found between frailty and parasitic infections (HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.62-2.20). Frailty was significantly associated with a higher risk of hospital-treated infections, except for parasitic infections. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of implementing frailty assessments are needed to confirm our results.","Xu, Minzhi; Gong, Yanhong; Yin, Xiaoxv","The journals of gerontology.

UK Biobank,40341140,Contributions of common and rare genetic variation to different measures of mood and anxiety disorder in the UK Biobank.,"Mood and anxiety disorders co-occur and share symptoms, treatments and genetic risk, but it is unclear whether combining them into a single phenotype would better capture genetic variation. The contribution of common genetic variation to these disorders has been investigated using a range of measures; however, the differences in their ability to capture variation remain unclear, while the impact of rare variation is mostly unexplored. We aimed to explore the contributions of common genetic variation and copy number variations associated with risk of psychiatric morbidity (P-CNVs) to different measures of internalising disorders. We investigated eight definitions of mood and anxiety disorder, and a combined internalising disorder, derived from self-report questionnaires, diagnostic assessments and electronic healthcare records (EHRs). Association of these definitions with polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder, as well as presence of a P-CNV, was assessed. The effect sizes of both PRSs and P-CNVs were similar for mood and anxiety disorder. Compared to mood and anxiety disorder, internalising disorder resulted in higher prediction accuracy for PRSs, and increased significance of associations with P-CNVs for most definitions. Comparison across the eight definitions showed that PRSs had higher prediction accuracy and effect sizes for stricter definitions, whereas P-CNVs were more strongly associated with EHR- and self-report-based definitions. Future studies may benefit from using a combined internalising disorder phenotype, and may need to consider that different phenotype definitions may be more informative depending on whether common or rare variation is studied.","Katzourou, Ioanna K; Barroso, Inês; Benger, Lauren; Ingason, Andrés; Stow, Daniel; Tsang, Ruby; Wood, Megan; Kirov, George; Walters, James; Owen, Michael J; Holmans, Peter; van den Bree, Marianne B M",BJPsych open,2025,,Internalising disorders; UK Biobank; anxiety; depression; genetics,"Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Medical School, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.; Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Institute of Biological Psychiatry, Roskilde, Denmark.; Wolfson Institute for Population Health, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.; Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.; School of Psychology, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.; Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Neuroscience and Mental Health Innovation Institute Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; Neuroscience and Mental Health Innovation Institute Division of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.",10.1192/bjo.2025.43
UK Biobank,38196638,A deep learning transformer model predicts high rates of undiagnosed rare disease in large electronic health systems.,"It is estimated that as many as 1 in 16 people worldwide suffer from rare diseases. Rare disease patients face difficulty finding diagnosis and treatment for their conditions, including long diagnostic odysseys, multiple incorrect diagnoses, and unavailable or prohibitively expensive treatments. As a result, it is likely that large electronic health record (EHR) systems include high numbers of participants suffering from undiagnosed rare disease. While this has been shown in detail for specific diseases, these studies are expensive and time consuming and have only been feasible to perform for a handful of the thousands of known rare diseases. The bulk of these undiagnosed cases are effectively hidden, with no straightforward way to differentiate them from healthy controls. The ability to access them at scale would enormously expand our capacity to study and develop drugs for rare diseases, adding to tools aimed at increasing availability of study cohorts for rare disease. In this study, we train a deep learning transformer algorithm, RarePT (Rare-Phenotype Prediction Transformer), to impute undiagnosed rare disease from EHR diagnosis codes in 436,407 participants in the UK Biobank and validated on an independent cohort from 3,333,560 individuals from the Mount Sinai Health System. We applied our model to 155 rare diagnosis codes with fewer than 250 cases each in the UK Biobank and predicted participants with elevated risk for each diagnosis, with the number of participants predicted to be at risk ranging from 85 to 22,000 for different diagnoses. These risk predictions are significantly associated with increased mortality for 65% of diagnoses, with disease burden expressed as disability-adjusted life years (DALY) for 73% of diagnoses, and with 72% of available disease-specific diagnostic tests. They are also highly enriched for known rare diagnoses in patients not included in the training set, with an odds ratio (OR) of 48.0 in cross-validation cohorts of the UK Biobank and an OR of 30.6 in the independent Mount Sinai Health System cohort. Most importantly, RarePT successfully screens for undiagnosed patients in 32 rare diseases with available diagnostic tests in the UK Biobank. Using the trained model to estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed disease in the UK Biobank for these 32 rare phenotypes, we find that at least 50% of patients remain undiagnosed for 20 of 32 diseases. These estimates provide empirical evidence of a high prevalence of undiagnosed rare disease, as well as demonstrating the enormous potential benefit of using RarePT to screen for undiagnosed rare disease patients in large electronic health systems.","Jordan, Daniel M; Vy, Ha My T; Do, Ron",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2023,,,"Center for Genomic Data Analytics, Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Genomic Data Analytics, Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Center for Genomic Data Analytics, Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.",10.1101/2023.12.21.23300393
UK Biobank,40520452,Mediterranean diet adherence and incident acute pancreatitis: a prospective cohort study.,"The relationship between Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) adherence and acute pancreatitis (AP) risk is largely unknown. To investigate the associations between MedDiet adherence and AP risk and joint associations of genetic risk and MedDiet adherence with AP risk. A prospective cohort study using data from UK Biobank, a large population-based prospective study that recruited over 500,000 participants aged 40-69 between 2006 and 2010 across the United Kingdom. We included 103,449 participants free of AP with typical dietary intake from 24-h dietary recalls. MedDiet adherence was measured via the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) continuous score. Genetic predisposition to AP was estimated by polygenic risk score (PRS). Incident AP cases were identified via electronic medical records. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. Mediation analyses were further applied to explore the mediating effects of the low-grade inflammation (INFLA) score and metabolic status. Over a mean follow-up period of 10.4 years, 371 AP cases were documented. Higher MedDiet adherence defined by MEDAS continuous score was inversely associated with lower AP risk (highest vs lowest tertiles: HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46-0.79,  The study suggests that higher adherence to the MedDiet is associated with a decreased risk of AP, which is partially mediated by inflammation and metabolic status, and may attenuate the deleterious impact of genetics on AP risk.","Zhou, Chunhua; Geng, Jiawei; Wu, Zhipeng; Dan, Lintao; Huang, Hanyi; Ruan, Xixian; Chen, Jie; Zhang, Yao; Zou, Duowu",Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,2025,,Mediterranean diet; acute pancreatitis; cohort study; genetics,"Department of Gastroenterology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 866, Yuhangtang Road, Changsha 410013, China.; Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, No. 197, Rui Jin Er Road, Shanghai 200025, China.; Department of Gastroenterology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, No. 197, Rui Jin Er Road, Shanghai 200025, China.",10.1177/17562848251346291
UK Biobank,40061333,Mixed-effects polygenic risk score Phenome-wide association study detects genetic correlation between colorectal cancer risk and phenotype data extracted from the electronic health record.,"Many factors, including environmental and genetic variables, contribute to Colorectal Cancer (CRC) risk. Some of these risk factors may share underlying genetics with CRC. We investigated potential shared genetics by performing a Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) with a multi-ancestry CRC polygenic risk score (PRS). The discovery cohort (N=426,464) consisted of ancestrally diverse participants from the United Kingdom Biobank. The replication cohort (N=87,271) consisted of ancestrally diverse participants from the electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network. We used a mixed-effects model to adjust for the presence of related individuals in both datasets. To preserve power, we limited testing to ancestor phecodes derived from the electronic health record (EHR), which were not likely to be a result of CRC or its treatment. We discovered and replicated associations between the CRC PRS and breast cancer, prostate cancer, obesity, smoking and alcohol use (discovery p< 1.1e-4; replication p<0.0019). As these results corroborate findings from other studies using orthogonal methods, we demonstrate that a CRC PRS can be used as a proxy for genetic risk for CRC when investigating shared genetics between CRC and other phenotypes. Further study of the relationship between PRS from multiple traits with EHR data may reveal additional shared genetic factors.","Rosenthal, Elisabeth A; Wei, Wei-Qi; Luo, Yuan; Namjou-Khales, Bahram; Schaid, Daniel J; Esplin, Edward D; Lape, Michael; Kottyan, Leah; Pacheco, Jennifer Allen Pacheco Allen; Weng, Chunhua; Gordon, Adam Samuel; Kullo, Iftikhar J; Crosslin, David R; Grady, William M; Hsu, Li; Peters, Ulrike; Jarvik, Gail P",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025,,,,10.1101/2025.02.26.25322864

Cancer patients with COVID-19 from the UK Biobank (UKB, n = 2230; March 16, 2020 to May 31, 2021; pre-Omicron-variants dominant) and electronic medical records in Hong Kong (HK cohort, n = 22,335; April 1, 2020 to October 31, 2022; Omicron-variant dominant) were included. Each COVID-19 case was randomly matched with up to 10 non-COVID-19 cancer patients based on age and sex. Follow-up lasted until 31 August 2021 for UKB and 23 January 2023 for HK. Inverse probability treatment weighting balanced cohort characteristics. Cox regression evaluated the association of COVID-19 with morbidities occurred 30 days post-infection. Cancer patients with COVID-19 consistently showed significantly higher risk of major cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) [UKB: hazard ratio [HR] 1.8 (95% CI 1.3, 2.5); HK: HR 1.4 (95% CI 1.1, 1.8)], CVD death [UKB: HR 4.3 (95% CI 2.9, 6.2); HK: HR 1.7 (95% CI 1.3, 2.4)], and all-cause mortality [UKB: HR 4.7 (95% CI 4.0, 5.5); HK: HR 1.6 (95% CI 1.5, 1.7)] in both cohorts despite the difference in dominant variants. Cancer patients at advanced ages or severely infected had higher all-cause mortality risk. However, associations between COVID-19 and CVDs became insignificant for fully vaccinated patients. COVID-19 infection is associated with increased risks of CVDs and mortality in cancer patients. Fully vaccination may reduce the post-acute effects of COVID-19 on CVDs. This information may guide effective pre-emptive measures to reduce COVID-19-related morbidities and mortality in cancer patients.","Wan, Eric Yuk Fai; Lee, Shing Fung; Zhou, Jiayi; Yan, Vincent Ka Chun; Lai, Francisco Tsz Tsun; Chui, Celine Sze Ling; Li, Xue; Wong, Carlos King Ho; Chan, Esther Wai Yin; Wong, Ian Chi Kei",Cancer medicine,2024,Humans; COVID-19; Hong Kong; Neoplasms; Male; Female; Middle Aged; United Kingdom; Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Adult; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Risk Factors; Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome,COVID‐19; CVDs; cancers; long‐term effect,"Centre for Safe Medication Practice and research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Radiation Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.; Department of Clinical Oncology, Tuen Mun Hospital, New Territories West Cluster, Hospital Authority, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; School of Nursing, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, School of Clinical Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; Department of Pharmacy, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China.; The University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation, Shenzhen, China.; Centre for Safe Medication Practice and research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.; Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (D24H), Hong Kong Science and Technology Park, Hong Kong, China.; Aston Pharmacy School, Aston University, Birmingham, UK.",10.1002/cam4.70134

Yet, our understanding of the prevalence and associated health outcomes is largely driven by observational studies of clinically diagnosed cases, resulting in a disproportionate focus on 47,XXY and associated hypogonadism. We analyzed microarray intensity data of sex chromosomes for 1.5 million individuals enrolled in three large cohorts-Million Veteran Program, FinnGen, and UK Biobank-to identify individuals with 47,XXY, 47,XYY, and 47,XXX. We examined disease conditions associated with SCTs by performing phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) using electronic health records (EHR) data for each cohort, followed by meta-analysis across cohorts.

UK Biobank,40359317,Exome-based genotype-first reverse phenotyping using structured electronic health record data identifies novel SERPINA1 variants associated with liver markers and demonstrates a dominant effect for specific variants on liver phenotype.,"Although several SERPINA1 genetic variants have been reported for their pathogenicity to induce liver disorders through phenotype-driven approaches, data regarding genotype-driven approaches of the SERPINA1 locus remain unavailable. This study aimed to characterize the clinical and liver biological profiles of patients harboring nonbenign SERPINA1 variants. We conducted a retrospective, exome-based genotype-first reverse phenotyping study using structured electronic health record data from consecutive patients from January 1, 2015, to January 31, 2022. Statistical associations were assessed using frequentist and Bayesian models, with validation in the UK Biobank cohort. Among 1377 patients analyzed, 15 SERPINA1 variants classified as nonbenign were identified in 217 (15.7%) patients. Data were available for 126 patients (median age, 41.5 years; 52.4% male). Liver disease, hyperferritinemia, and pulmonary emphysema were observed in 32.5% (41/126), 23% (29/126), and 5.6% (7/126) of the patients, respectively. The median follow-up duration was 1.3 years and encompassed 1085 biological observations. We confirmed associations with well-documented variants of SERPINA1 (p.Glu366Lys, p.Pro393Ser, p.Ala308Ser, p.Glu288Val, and p.Phe76del). We identified three novel genetic associations with liver markers: c.*10G > A, c.1065 + 10C > T, and p.Arg63Cys. The UK Biobank data confirmed significant gene- and variant-level associations, notably for the variants identified in our study, which ranked in the top decile of statistical associations. This study supports the utility of a genotype-first approach in characterizing hepatic manifestations of nonbenign SERPINA1 variants. The findings highlight novel genotype-biomarker associations and suggest a role for SERPINA1 genetic testing in patients with unexplained liver abnormalities.","Silva Rodriguez, Maël; Mulot, Margaux; Chéry, Céline; Bensenane, Mouni; Guéant-Rodriguez, Rosa-Maria; Jaussaud, Roland; Cobat, Aurélie; Feillet, François; Bronowicki, Jean-Pierre; Namour, Farès; Guéant, Jean-Louis; Oussalah, Abderrahim",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,2025,,ACMG reclassification; SERPINA1; alpha‐1 antitrypsin deficiency; exome‐based genotype‐first reverse phenotyping; liver disease markers,"Department of Genomic Medicine, Division of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Nutrition, and Metabolism, University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Reference Center for Inborn Errors of Metabolism (ORPHA67872), University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Department of Genomic Medicine, Division of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Nutrition, and Metabolism, University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Department of Genomic Medicine, Division of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Nutrition, and Metabolism, University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Reference Center for Inborn Errors of Metabolism (ORPHA67872), University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Faculty of Medicine of Nancy, INSERM UMR_S 1256, Nutrition, Genetics, and Environmental Risk Exposure (NGERE), University of Lorraine, Nancy, France.; Department of Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Department of Genomic Medicine, Division of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Nutrition, and Metabolism, University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Reference Center for Inborn Errors of Metabolism (ORPHA67872), University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Faculty of Medicine of Nancy, INSERM UMR_S 1256, Nutrition, Genetics, and Environmental Risk Exposure (NGERE), University of Lorraine, Nancy, France.; Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases, Necker Branch, INSERM U1163, Necker Hospital for Sick Children, Paris, France.; Paris Cité University, Imagine Institute, Paris, France.; St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases, Rockefeller Branch, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA.; Reference Center for Inborn Errors of Metabolism (ORPHA67872), University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Faculty of Medicine of Nancy, INSERM UMR_S 1256, Nutrition, Genetics, and Environmental Risk Exposure (NGERE), University of Lorraine, Nancy, France.; Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Reference Center for Inborn Errors of Metabolism (ORPHA67872), University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Faculty of Medicine of Nancy, INSERM UMR_S 1256, Nutrition, Genetics, and Environmental Risk Exposure (NGERE), University of Lorraine, Nancy, France.; Department of Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Department of Genomic Medicine, Division of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Nutrition, and Metabolism, University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Reference Center for Inborn Errors of Metabolism (ORPHA67872), University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Faculty of Medicine of Nancy, INSERM UMR_S 1256, Nutrition, Genetics, and Environmental Risk Exposure (NGERE), University of Lorraine, Nancy, France.; Department of Genomic Medicine, Division of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Nutrition, and Metabolism, University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Reference Center for Inborn Errors of Metabolism (ORPHA67872), University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Faculty of Medicine of Nancy, INSERM UMR_S 1256, Nutrition, Genetics, and Environmental Risk Exposure (NGERE), University of Lorraine, Nancy, France.; Department of Genomic Medicine, Division of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Nutrition, and Metabolism, University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Reference Center for Inborn Errors of Metabolism (ORPHA67872), University Hospital of Nancy, Nancy, France.; Faculty of Medicine of Nancy, INSERM UMR_S 1256, Nutrition, Genetics, and Environmental Risk Exposure (NGERE), University of Lorraine, Nancy, France.",10.1111/hepr.14203
UK Biobank,40577098,An empirical assessment of differential privacy in real-world observational data: a case-control study of asthma exacerbation in UK Biobank linked with electronic health records.,"Electronic health records (EHRs) provide substantial resources for observational studies, yet present significant challenges in safeguarding patient privacy while maintaining research quality. Differential privacy (DP) offers a quantifiable privacy guarantee; however, its impact on observational studies remains underexplored. We empirically evaluated the effects of DP across varying values of its privacy parameter, epsilon, on case-control analysis outcomes using EHR data. This study aims to inform DP parameter selection and examines the influence of study characteristics on differentially private observational studies. We assessed the effects of DP on a case-control study of 1-year asthma exacerbations, including 22 165 participants with a history of asthma from UK Biobank linked to EHR data. Odds ratios (ORs) for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities were analyzed using adjusted and propensity score-matched models across epsilon values. DP influenced the magnitude, direction, and statistical significance of ORs, occasionally resembling patterns of misclassification, residual confounding, and false-positive bias. Rare and imbalanced covariates showed greater OR variability, especially in matched studies. Epsilons smaller than ln(2) led to noticeable OR fluctuations. The impact of DP on ORs and selection of an optimal epsilon depends on sample size, covariate prevalence, confounders, case-to-control ratios in propensity score matching, mitigation of random seed p-hacking, and trust models. The effects of DP on ORs are highly context-dependent. In this study, epsilon values below ln(2) led to unstable ORs across random seeds. Averaging results or using predetermined seeds may help reduce variability and mitigate p-hacking.","Mizani, Mehrdad A; Sheikh, Aziz; Banerjee, Amitava",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2025,,case-control studies; differential privacy; matched case-control studies; observational studies; patient data privacy,"Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London NW1 2DA, United Kingdom.; Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford OX2 6GG, United Kingdom.; Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London NW1 2DA, United Kingdom.",10.1093/jamia/ocaf090
UK Biobank,37577704,Integrating Genome-wide information and Wearable Device Data to Explore the Link of Anxiety and Antidepressants with Heart Rate Variability.,"Anxiety disorders are associated with decreased heart rate variability (HRV), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We selected individuals with whole-genome sequencing, Fitbit, and electronic health record data (N=920; 61,333 data points) from the All of Us Research Program. Anxiety PRS were derived with PRS-CS after meta-analyzing anxiety genome-wide association studies from three major cohorts-UK Biobank, FinnGen, and the Million Veterans Program (N Total =364,550). The standard deviation of average RR intervals (SDANN) was calculated using five-minute average RR intervals over full 24-hour heart rate measurements. Antidepressant exposure was defined as an active antidepressant prescription at the time of the HRV measurement in the EHR. The associations of daily SDANN measurements with the anxiety PRS, antidepressant classes, and antidepressant substances were tested. Participants with lifetime diagnoses of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus, and major depression were excluded in sensitivity analyses. One-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to assess potential causal effect of anxiety on SDANN. Anxiety PRS was independently associated with reduced SDANN (beta=-0.08; p=0.003). Of the eight antidepressant medications and four classes tested, venlafaxine (beta=-0.12, p=0.002) and bupropion (beta=-0.071, p=0.01), tricyclic antidepressants (beta=-0.177, p=0.0008), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.069; p=0.0008) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.16; p=2×10  Anxiety and antidepressants are independently associated with decreased HRV, and anxiety appears to exert a causal effect on HRV.

UK Biobank,40266617,Detection Bias in EHR-Based Research on Clinical Exposures and Dementia.,"Detection bias occurs when an exposure is associated with a systematic difference in outcome ascertainment or diagnosis. For dementia research, diagnosed health conditions that bring patients into frequent interaction with health care may increase the chance that an individual receives a dementia diagnosis. To evaluate potential detection bias or misdiagnosis bias in evaluation of clinical factors associated with dementia using electronic health record (EHR) data. This prospective cohort study used data from 2 population-based volunteer cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB) and All of Us (AOU). Participants were aged 55 years or older, were dementia-free at baseline, and had linked EHRs. Participants in UKB were followed up from baseline (2006-2010) until December 2022, and in AOU, from baseline (2017-2022) until July 2022. Data were analyzed from November 2023 through February 2025. Diagnoses of type 2 diabetes, depression, hypertension, urinary tract infection, kidney stones, forearm fracture, and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Rate of incident all-cause dementia diagnosis from EHRs and associations between clinical exposures and incident dementia diagnosis, assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Among 228 392 participants from UKB (n = 137 374; mean [SD] age at baseline, 62.5 [4.1] years; 53.8% female) and AOU (n = 91 018; mean [SD] age at baseline, 66.9 [7.8] years; 57.1% female), those with a history of a clinical exposure at baseline had higher dementia incidence rates compared with those without such history. For example, among participants with a history of GI bleeding, the dementia incidence rates were 3.0 (UKB) and 7.7 (AOU) per 1000 person-years compared with 2.2 (UKB) and 2.4 (AOU) per 1000 person-years among those without a history of GI bleeding. All exposures were significantly associated with incident dementia, with hazard ratios (HRs) ranging from 1.18 (95% CI, 1.00-1.40) to 3.51 (95% CI, 3.08-4.01). Risk of incident dementia was typically highest in the first year following exposure diagnosis and attenuated thereafter. For example, in the first year after GI bleeding, there were larger elevations in risk of incident dementia (HR, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.46-3.22] in UKB; HR, 2.56 [95% CI, 1.62-4.04] in AOU) compared with 1 to 5 years after bleeding (HR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.15-1.86] in UKB; HR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.63-2.81] in AOU). In this cohort study of 2 large datasets, diagnoses of several conditions associated with varying risks of dementia were associated with a higher short-term likelihood of dementia diagnosis. This finding suggests that diagnostic bias or misdiagnoses may lead to spurious associations between conditions requiring clinical care and subsequent dementia diagnoses.","Wang, Jingxuan; Choi, Minhyuk; Buto, Peter; Kelly, J Daniel; La Joie, Renaud; Kornak, John; Zimmerman, Scott C; Chen, Ruijia; Raphael, Eva; Schaefer, Catherine A; Blacker, Deborah; Glymour, M Maria",JAMA network open,2025,"Humans; Dementia; Female; Male; Electronic Health Records; Aged; Prospective Studies; Middle Aged; Bias; United Kingdom; United States; Diagnostic Errors; Aged, 80 and over",,"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; Department of Epidemiology, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco.; F.I.

UK Biobank,39910980,"Role of primary and secondary care data in atrial fibrillation ascertainment: impact on risk factor associations, patient management, and mortality in UK Biobank.","Electronic healthcare records (EHR) are at the forefront of advances in epidemiological research emerging from large-scale population biobanks and clinical studies. Hospital admissions, diagnoses, and procedures (HADP) data are often used to identify disease cases. However, this may result in incomplete ascertainment of chronic conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF), which are principally managed in primary care (PC). We examined the relevance of EHR sources for AF ascertainment, and the implications for risk factor associations, patient management, and outcomes in UK Biobank. UK Biobank is a prospective study, with HADP and PC records available for 230 000 participants (to 2016). AF cases were ascertained in three groups: from PC records only (PC-only), HADP only (HADP-only), or both (PC + HADP). Conventional statistical methods were used to describe differences between groups in terms of characteristics, risk factor associations, ascertainment timing, rates of anticoagulation, and post-AF stroke and death. A total of 7136 incident AF cases were identified during 7 years median follow-up (PC-only: 22%, PC + HADP: 49%, HADP-only: 29%). There was a median lag of 1.3 years between cases ascertained in PC and subsequently in HADP. AF cases in each of the ascertainment groups had comparable baseline demographic characteristics. However, AF cases identified in hospital data alone had a higher prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities and lower rates of subsequent anticoagulation (PC-only: 44%, PC + HADP: 48%, HADP-only: 10%, P < 0.0001) than other groups. HADP-only cases also had higher rates of death [PC-only: 9.3 (6.8, 12.7), PC + HADP: 23.4 (20.5, 26.6), HADP-only: 81.2 (73.8, 89.2) events per 1000 person-years, P < 0.0001] compared to other groups. Integration of data from primary care with that from hospital records has a substantial impact on AF ascertainment, identifying a third more cases than hospital records alone. However, about a third of AF cases recorded in hospital were not present in the primary care records, and these cases had lower rates of anticoagulation, as well as higher mortality from both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes. Initiatives aimed at enhancing information exchange of clinically confirmed AF between healthcare settings have the potential to benefit patient management and AF-related outcomes at an individual and population level. This research underscores the importance of access and integration of de-identified comprehensive EHR data for a definitive understanding of patient trajectories, and for robust epidemiological and translational research into AF.","Camm, C Fielder; Von Ende, Adam; Gajendragadkar, Parag R; Pessoa-Amorim, Guilherme; Mafham, Marion; Allen, Naomi; Parish, Sarah; Casadei, Barbara; Hopewell, Jemma C","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2025,Humans; Atrial Fibrillation; Male; United Kingdom; Primary Health Care; Female; Aged; Risk Factors; Middle Aged; Electronic Health Records; Prospective Studies; Secondary Care; Anticoagulants; Stroke; Risk Assessment; Biological Specimen Banks; UK Biobank,Ascertainment; Atrial fibrillation; Electronic healthcare records; Primary care; UK Biobank,"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Big Data Institute, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.; Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Big Data Institute, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.; Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Big Data Institute, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.; Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Big Data Institute, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.; Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Big Data Institute, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.; Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Big Data Institute, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.; Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Big Data Institute, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.; Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Big Data Institute, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.",10.1093/europace/euae291

We investigated the associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and genetic factors with risks of total and subtypes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), among whom vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is particularly common. This prospective study included 15,103 individuals with T2D who were initially free of CVD and had serum 25(OH)D measurements in the UK Biobank. Incidences of total and subtypes of CVD, including ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, were ascertained via electronic health records. Weighted genetic risk scores (GRSs) were constructed for IHD and stroke. The mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 43.4 nmol/L (SD: 20.4 nmol/L), and 65.7% of participants had a vitamin D concentration below 50 nmol/L. During a median of 11.2 years of follow-up, 3534 incident CVD events were documented. Compared with individuals with 25(OH)D concentrations <25 nmol/L, participants with 25(OH)D concentrations ≥75 nmol/L had HRs (95% CIs) of 0.75 (0.64, 0.88) for CVD, 0.69 (0.56, 0.84) for IHD, and 0.74 (0.52, 1.06) for stroke. Participants with 25(OH)D concentrations ≥50 nmol/L and low GRSs, as compared with individuals with 25(OH)D concentrations <25 nmol/L and high GRSs, had a 50% (39%, 65%) lower risk of IHD. No significant interactions were demonstrated between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and the GRSs and genetic variants in vitamin D receptors (VDR). Higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly associated with lower risks of total CVD and IHD among patients with T2D, regardless of their genetic susceptibility and the genetic variants in VDR. Risk reductions tended to plateau at serum 25(OH)D levels around 50 nmol/L. These findings suggest that maintaining an adequate vitamin D status and avoiding deficiency may help to prevent CVD complications among patients with T2D.","Wan, Zhenzhen; Geng, Tingting; Li, Rui; Chen, Xue; Lu, Qi; Lin, Xiaoyu; Chen, Liangkai; Guo, Yanjun; Liu, Liegang; Shan, Zhilei; Pan, An; Manson, JoAnn E; Liu, Gang",The American journal of clinical nutrition,2022,"Humans; Prospective Studies; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Vitamin D; Vitamin D Deficiency; Vitamins; Risk Factors; Stroke; Myocardial Ischemia",cardiovascular disease; epidemiology; genetic risk score; type 2 diabetes; vitamin D,"Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education Key Lab of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environment Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

UK Biobank,33606446,Identification of Three Loci Associated with Achilles Tendon Injury Risk from a Genome-wide Association Study.,"This study aimed to screen the entire genome for genetic markers associated with risk for Achilles tendon injury. A genome-wide association analysis was performed using data from the Kaiser Permanente Research Board and the UK Biobank. Achilles tendon injury cases were identified based on electronic health records from the Kaiser Permanente Research Board databank and the UK Biobank from individuals of European ancestry. Genome-wide association analyses from both cohorts were tested for Achilles tendon injury using a logistic regression model adjusting for sex, height, weight, and race/ethnicity using allele counts for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Previously identified genes within the literature were also tested for association with Achilles tendon injury. There were a total of 12,354 cases of Achilles tendon injury and 483,080 controls within the two combined cohorts, with 67 SNP in three chromosomal loci demonstrating a genome-wide significant association with Achilles tendon injury. The first locus contains a single SNP (rs183364169) near the CDCP1 and TMEM158 genes on chromosome 3. The second locus contains 65 SNP in three independently segregating sets near the MPP7 gene on chromosome 10. The last locus contains a single SNP (rs4454832) near the SOX21 and GPR180 genes on chromosome 13. The current data were used to test 14 candidate genes previously reported to show an association with Achilles tendon injury, but none showed a significant association (all P > 0.05).

UK Biobank,38628153,Mendelian Randomization Analysis of the Causal Effect of Cigarette Smoking on Hospital Costs.,"Knowledge of the impact of smoking on health care costs is important for establishing the external effects of smoking and for evaluating policies intended to modify this behavior. Conventional analysis of this association is difficult because of omitted variable bias, reverse causality, and measurement error. We approached these challenges using a Mendelian Randomization study design; genetic variants associated with smoking behaviors were used in instrumental variables models with inpatient hospital costs (calculated from electronic health records) as the outcome. We undertook genome-wide association studies to identify genetic variants associated with smoking initiation and a composite smoking index (reflecting cumulative health impacts of smoking) on up to 300 045 individuals (mean age: 57 years at baseline, range 39-72 years) in the UK Biobank. We followed individuals up for a mean of 6 years. Genetic liability to initiate smoking (ever vs. never smoking) was estimated to increase mean per-patient annual inpatient hospital costs by £477 (95% confidence interval (CI): £187 to £766). A one-unit change in genetic liability to the composite smoking index (range: 0-4.0) increased inpatient hospital costs by £204 (95% CI: £105 to £303) per unit increase in this index. There was some evidence that the composite smoking index causal models violated the instrumental variable assumptions, and all Mendelian Randomization models were estimated with considerable uncertainty. Models conditioning on risk tolerance were not robust to weak instrument bias. Our findings have implications for the potential cost-effectiveness of smoking interventions. We report the first Mendelian Randomization analysis of the causal effect of smoking on health care costs. Using two smoking phenotypes, we identified substantial impacts of smoking on inpatient hospital costs, although the causal models were associated with considerable uncertainty. These results could be used alongside other evidence on the impact of smoking to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of antismoking interventions and to understand the scale of externalities associated with this behavior.","Dixon, Padraig; Sallis, Hannah; Munafò, Marcus; Davey Smith, George; Howe, Laura",Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,2024,Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged; Adult; Cigarette Smoking; Genome-Wide Association Study; Hospital Costs; United Kingdom,,"Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, UK.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, UK.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, UK.; School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol, UK.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, UK.; School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol, UK.; NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University of Bristol, UK.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, UK.; NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University of Bristol, UK.; Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol, UK.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, UK.; Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol, UK.",10.1093/ntr/ntae089
UK Biobank,38083636,"Is Maximal or Usual Walking Speed from Large Scale Wrist Sensor Data Better at Predicting Dementia, Depression and Death?","Older people are at increased risk of many adverse health outcomes, including dementia and depression, that burden the global health system. This paper presents algorithms for the large-scale assessment of daily walking speeds. We hypothesize that (i) data from wrist-worn sensors can be used to assess walking speed accurately; and that (ii) maximal daily walking speed is a better predictor of health outcomes than usual daily walking speed. First, algorithms were developed and tested using data from 101 participants aged 19 to 91 (47 ± 18) years. Participants wore an AX3 accelerometer (Axivity, UK) on their dominant wrist while undertaking daily life activities with electronic walkway data used for ground truth. Subsequently, prediction models for dementia, depression and death were developed using the data of 47,406 participants (≥ 60 years) from the UK Biobank study. Daily walking speeds were derived from 7-day AX3 data with time-to-events using electronic health records. The accuracy of derived walking speeds was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE). Time-to-events were modelled using Cox regression with inverse hazard ratios reported for univariable models and Harrell's concordance for multivariable models. Derived walking speeds had an RMSE of between 3% and 4% depending on arm position. We found that for simple models, maximal walking speed was significantly better than usual walking speed at predicting time to dementia (1.62 vs 1.34), depression (1.29 vs 1.17) and death (1.56 vs 1.27). However, the addition of known risk factors in subsequent multivariable models reduced the apparent benefit of using maximal as opposed to usual daily walking speed as the gait parameter. In summary, walking speed was accurately measured with a wrist-worn device, and maximal daily waking speed may be better than usual daily walking speed at predicting some adverse health outcomes.Clinical Relevance- This study demonstrated the validity of using a simple and unobtrusive wrist-worn sensor to remotely assess daily walking speed. As a single, modifiable and easily understood measure, maximal walking speed was shown to be better than usual walking speed at predicting time-to-dementia, depression and death. Therefore, the inclusion of maximal daily walking speed into screening programs and clinical interventions presents a promising area for further research.","Chan, Lloyd L Y; Lord, Stephen R; Brodie, Matthew A",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

UK Biobank,39269986,Integration of estimated regional gene expression with neuroimaging and clinical phenotypes at biobank scale.,"An understanding of human brain individuality requires the integration of data on brain organization across people and brain regions, molecular and systems scales, as well as healthy and clinical states. Here, we help advance this understanding by leveraging methods from computational genomics to integrate large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, neuroimaging, and electronic-health record data sets. We estimated genetically regulated gene expression (gr-expression) of 18,647 genes, across 10 cortical and subcortical regions of 45,549 people from the UK Biobank. First, we showed that patterns of estimated gr-expression reflect known genetic-ancestry relationships, regional identities, as well as inter-regional correlation structure of directly assayed gene expression. Second, we performed transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to discover 1,065 associations between individual variation in gr-expression and gray-matter volumes across people and brain regions. We benchmarked these associations against results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the same sample and found hundreds of novel associations relative to these GWAS. Third, we integrated our results with clinical associations of gr-expression from the Vanderbilt Biobank. This integration allowed us to link genes, via gr-expression, to neuroimaging and clinical phenotypes. Fourth, we identified associations of polygenic gr-expression with structural and functional MRI phenotypes in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), a small neuroimaging-genomic data set with high-quality functional imaging data. Finally, we showed that estimates of gr-expression and magnitudes of TWAS were generally replicable and that the p-values of TWAS were replicable in large samples. Collectively, our results provide a powerful new resource for integrating gr-expression with population genetics of brain organization and disease.","Hoang, Nhung; Sardaripour, Neda; Ramey, Grace D; Schilling, Kurt; Liao, Emily; Chen, Yiting; Park, Jee Hyun; Bledsoe, Xavier; Landman, Bennett A; Gamazon, Eric R; Benton, Mary Lauren; Capra, John A; Rubinov, Mikail",PLoS biology,2024,"Humans; Biological Specimen Banks; Genome-Wide Association Study; Neuroimaging; Phenotype; Brain; Male; Transcriptome; Female; Gray Matter; Middle Aged; Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; Aged; Gene Expression; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",,"Department of Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Biological and Medical Informatics Division, University of California, San Francisco, California, United States of America.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, California, United States of America.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Computer Science, Baylor University, Waco, Texas, United States of America.; Department of Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, California, United States of America.; Department of Biological Sciences, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, University of California, San Francisco, California, United States of America.; Department of Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Department of Psychology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Research Campus, Ashburn, Virginia, United States of America.",10.1371/journal.pbio.3002782

In this study, we used a phenome wide association study (PheWAS) approach to identify cross-phenotype associations between previously identified genetic AD and for electronic health record (EHR) diagnoses from the UK Biobank (UKBB) (n=361,194 of European ancestry) and the eMERGE Network (n=105,108 of diverse ancestry). Based on 497 previously identified AD-associated variants from the Alzheimer's Disease Variant Portal (ADVP), we found significant associations primarily in immune and cardiac related diseases in our PheWAS. Replicating variants have widespread impacts on immune genes in diverse tissue types. This study demonstrates the potential of using the PheWAS strategy to improve our understanding of AD progression as well as identify potential drug repurposing opportunities for new treatment and disease prevention strategies.","Moore, Anni; Ritchie, Marylyn D",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2023,,,"Genomics and Computational Biology Group, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.; Genomics and Computational Biology Group, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.; Institute of Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; Division of Informatics, DBEI, Perelman School of Medicine., University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.",10.1101/2023.11.06.23297993
UK Biobank,39757747,Differential Organ Ageing Is Associated With Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive disorder and the leading cause of central vision loss. Age is the most important risk factor, followed by genetics and smoking. However, ageing is a complex process, and biological age can deviate from chronological age between individuals and within different organ systems. Initially, we used machine learning to predict the biological age of the immune, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, musculoskeletal, metabolic and hepatic systems by analysing various physiological and physical markers in the UK Biobank cohort. Then, we investigated the association of each organ's biological age with incident AMD derived from electronic health record data as well as with different AMD genetic risk scores. We observed that most organ systems in participants who developed AMD after recruitment showed accelerated ageing compared with controls, with the immune system being the most affected, especially in younger males. Surprisingly, we found that AMD patients showed slower ageing of their hepatic system compared to controls, particularly in female patients. The overall AMD genetic risk score was associated with faster organ ageing across all tissues except cardiovascular and pulmonary, while genetic risk scores stratified by pathways differently influenced each organ system. In conclusion, we found differential organ ageing associated with AMD. Significantly, genetic risk variants of AMD are associated with differential ageing of various organ systems.","Papadam, Anastasios; Lionikas, Arimantas; Grassmann, Felix",Aging cell,2025,"Humans; Macular Degeneration; Male; Female; Aged; Aging; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Aged, 80 and over",ageing; age‐related macular degeneration; biological age; genetics; machine learning,"Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.; Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.; Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.; Institute for Clinical Research and Systems Medicine, Health and Medical University, Potsdam, Germany.",10.1111/acel.14473

Delineating specific inflammatory pathways and biomarkers of their activity could identify the mechanistic underpinnings of the increased risk. Plasma levels of kynurenine, a metabolite involved in inflammation, associates with cardiometabolic disease risk. We used genetic approaches to identify inflammatory mechanisms associated with kynurenine variability and their relationship to cardiometabolic disease. We identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with plasma kynurenine, including a missense-variant (rs3184504) in the inflammatory gene SH2B3/LNK. We examined the association between rs3184504 and plasma kynurenine in independent human samples, and measured kynurenine levels in SH2B3-knock-out mice and during human LPS-evoked endotoxemia.

UK Biobank,40315941,Risk of ischemic stroke in sinus node dysfunction with and without atrial fibrillation: Evidence for the presence of a left atrial myopathy in patients with isolated sinus node dysfunction-an analysis of the UK Biobank.,"Emerging evidence indicates sinus node dysfunction (SND) may be an important marker of a biatrial myopathy. However, the relative risk of ischemic stroke in isolated SND has not been clearly delineated in comparative prospective studies. This study examined the association between SND (with and without concomitant atrial fibrillation [AF]) and ischemic stroke (IS) in the UK Biobank. The UK Biobank is a prospective, population-based cohort of >500,000 individuals aged 40-69 years recruited across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010, with follow-up extending beyond 10 years. Incident health events were longitudinally tracked through electronic health record linkages with hospital admissions, primary care records, and death registration data using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision coding. Individuals with SND, AF, or both were identified. Patients with prosthetic heart valves, rheumatic mitral valve diseases, mitral stenosis, and prior IS were excluded. The primary end point was time to IS. Of the 451,493 participants (median age 57 years, 44.2% male) included in this study: 593 had isolated SND, 955 had combined SND and AF, 37,065 had isolated AF, and 412,880 comprised controls with neither SND nor AF. During a median follow-up of 13.2 years, yearly IS incidence was 0.37%, 0.60%, 0.59%, and 0.10% in these groups, respectively. In multivariable competing-risk regression modeling accounting for death, isolated SND conferred a significantly increased risk of IS compared to controls (subdistribution hazard ratio 2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.57-3.31; P < .001). Participants with AF and SND had a similar risk of IS, compared to those with isolated AF (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-1.37; P = .58). SND is an independent risk marker for the development of IS in individuals without AF. This provides further evidence of SND being an electrical marker of a biatrial myopathy.","Virk, Sohaib A; Ho, William W H; Takeuchi, Fumihiko; Morris, Gwilym M; Kistler, Peter M; Kalman, Jonathan",Heart rhythm,2025,,Atrial fibrillation; Atrial myopathy; Ischemic stroke; Sick sinus syndrome; Sinus node dysfunction; Stroke,"Department of Cardiology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia; University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Australia.; Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Australia; Baker Department of Cardiometabolic Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.; Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Australia.; Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom; Department of Cardiology, John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, Australia; Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle, Australia.; University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Australia; Department of Cardiology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia; Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Cardiology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia; University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Australia.

UK Biobank,39670380,Detecting clinician implicit biases in diagnoses using proximal causal inference.,"Clinical decisions to treat and diagnose patients are affected by implicit biases formed by racism, ableism, sexism, and other stereotypes. These biases reflect broader systemic discrimination in healthcare and risk marginalizing already disadvantaged groups. Existing methods for measuring implicit biases require controlled randomized testing and only capture individual attitudes rather than outcomes. However, the ""big-data"" revolution has led to the availability of large observational medical datasets, like EHRs and biobanks, that provide the opportunity to investigate discrepancies in patient health outcomes. In this work, we propose a causal inference approach to detect the effect of clinician implicit biases on patient outcomes in large-scale medical data. Specifically, our method uses proximal mediation to disentangle pathway-specific effects of a patient's sociodemographic attribute on a clinician's diagnosis decision. We test our method on real-world data from the UK Biobank. Our work can serve as a tool that initiates conversation and brings awareness to unequal health outcomes caused by implicit biases.","Liu, Kara; Altman, Russ; Syrgkanis, Vasilis",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

UK Biobank,30090940,Association of Interleukin 6 Receptor Variant With Cardiovascular Disease Effects of Interleukin 6 Receptor Blocking Therapy: A Phenome-Wide Association Study.,"Electronic health record (EHR) biobanks containing clinical and genomic data on large numbers of individuals have great potential to inform drug discovery. Individuals with interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) who are not receiving IL6R blocking therapy have biomarker profiles similar to those treated with IL6R blockers. This gene-drug pair provides an example to test whether associations of IL6R SNPs with a broad range of phenotypes can inform which diseases may benefit from treatment with IL6R blockade. To determine whether screening for clinical associations with the IL6R SNP in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) using EHR biobank data can identify drug effects from IL6R clinical trials. Diagnosis codes and routine laboratory measurements were extracted from the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP); diagnosis codes were mapped to phenotype groups using published PheWAS methods. A PheWAS was performed by fitting logistic regression models for testing associations of the IL6R SNPs with 1342 phenotype groups and by fitting linear regression models for testing associations of the IL6R SNP with 26 routine laboratory measurements. Significance was reported using a false discovery rate of 0.05 or less. Findings were replicated in 2 independent cohorts using UK Biobank and Vanderbilt University Biobank data. The Million Veteran Program included 332 799 US veterans; the UK Biobank, 408 455 individuals from the general population of the United Kingdom; and the Vanderbilt University Biobank, 13 835 patients from a tertiary care center. IL6R SNPs (rs2228145; rs4129267). Phenotypes defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Of the 332 799 veterans included in the main cohort, 305 228 (91.7%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 66.1 (13.6) years. The IL6R SNP was most strongly associated with a reduced risk of aortic aneurysm phenotypes (odds ratio, 0.87-0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.93) in the MVP. We observed known off-target effects of IL6R blockade from clinical trials (eg, higher hemoglobin level). The reduced risk for aortic aneurysms among those with the IL6R SNP in the MVP was replicated in the Vanderbilt University Biobank, and the reduced risk for coronary heart disease was replicated in the UK Biobank. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated application of the PheWAS using large EHR biobanks to inform drug effects. The findings of an association of the IL6R SNP with reduced risk for aortic aneurysms correspond with the newest indication for IL6R blockade, giant cell arteritis, of which a major complication is aortic aneurysm.","Cai, Tianxi; Zhang, Yichi; Ho, Yuk-Lam; Link, Nicholas; Sun, Jiehuan; Huang, Jie; Cai, Tianrun A; Damrauer, Scott; Ahuja, Yuri; Honerlaw, Jacqueline; Huang, Jie; Costa, Lauren; Schubert, Petra; Hong, Chuan; Gagnon, David; Sun, Yan V; Gaziano, J Michael; Wilson, Peter; Cho, Kelly; Tsao, Philip; O'Donnell, Christopher J; Liao, Katherine P",JAMA cardiology,2018,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Aortic Aneurysm; Cardiovascular Diseases; Current Procedural Terminology; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Proof of Concept Study; Receptors, Interleukin-6; Veterans",,"Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts.; Harvard T.

Previous work on lung dysfunction in this population has mainly focused on restrictive lung disease, in patients with severe CHD phenotypes. We examined the association of mild CHD with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the UK Biobank (UKB). Electronic health records (EHR) were used to identify 3385 CHD cases and 479,765 healthy controls in UKB, before performing a case-control analysis over a 20-year study period for a total of > 9.5 M person-years of follow-up. Our analysis showed that UKB participants with CHD are at substantially greater risk of developing COPD than healthy controls (8.7% vs 3.1% prevalence, unadjusted OR 2.98, 95% CI 2.63, 3.36, P = 1.40e-53). Slightly increased rates of smoking were observed amongst CHD cases, however the association with COPD was shown to be robust to adjustment for smoking and other factors known to modulate COPD risk within a multivariable-adjusted Cox regression framework (fully adjusted HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.97, 2.48, P = 5.5e-41). Care for adults with CHD should aim to mitigate their increased risk of COPD, possibly via increased smoking cessation support.","Byrne, Dominic J F; Williams, Simon G; Nakev, Apostol; Frain, Simon; Baross, Stephanie L; Vestbo, Jørgen; Keavney, Bernard D; Talavera, David",Scientific reports,2022,"Humans; Risk Factors; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Smoking Cessation; Smoking; Heart Defects, Congenital",,"Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.; Cybersecurity Department, Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, Singapore.; Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.; Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.; Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.; Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.; Division of Infection, Immunity & Respiratory Medicine, School of Biological Sciences, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.; Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.; Manchester Heart Institute, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.; Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK. david.talavera@manchester.ac.uk.",10.1038/s41598-022-21433-8
UK Biobank,38181928,Dissecting the associations of KCNH2 genetic polymorphisms with various types of cardiac arrhythmias.,"Cardiac arrhythmia, a common cardiovascular disease, is closely related to genetic polymorphisms. However, the associations between polymorphisms in KCNH2 and various arrhythmias remain inadequately explored. Guided by the assumption that KCNH2 genetic polymorphisms significantly contribute to the development of arrhythmias, we thoroughly explored the associations between 85 KCNH2 genetic variations and 16 cardiac arrhythmias in a sample obtained from the UK Biobank (UKBB, N = 307,473). The illnesses documented in the electronic medical records of the sample were mapped to a phecode system for a more accurate representation of distinct phenotypes. Survival analysis was used to test the effect of KCNH2 variants on arrhythmia incidence, and a phenotype-wide association study (PheWAS) was performed to investigate the effect of KCNH2 polymorphisms on 102 traits, including physical measurements, biomarkers, and hematological indicators. Novel associations of variants rs2269001 and rs7789585 in KCNH2 with paroxysmal tachycardia (PT) and atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFL), respectively, were identified. Moreover, with an increase in the number of minor alleles of these two variants, the incidence rates of PT and AF/AFL decreased. In addition, the PheWAS results suggested that these two single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with multiple parameters in physical measurements and neutrophil percentage. The multiple novel associations observed in this study illustrate the importance of KCNH2 genetic variations in the pathogenesis of arrhythmia.","Li, Sen; Zhang, Zhang; Ding, Yining; Yu, Tingting; Qin, Zongshi; Guo, Shuzhen",Gene,2024,"Humans; Atrial Fibrillation; Atrial Flutter; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Alleles; ERG1 Potassium Channel",Arrhythmia; Genetic polymorphisms; KCNH2; PheWAS; UK Biobank,"School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.

UK Biobank,38405832,To weight or not to weight? Studying the effect of selection bias in three large EHR-linked biobanks.,"To explore the role of selection bias adjustment by weighting electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobank data for commonly performed analyses. We mapped diagnosis (ICD code) data to standardized phecodes from three EHR-linked biobanks with varying recruitment strategies: All of Us (AOU; n=244,071), Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI; n=81,243), and UK Biobank (UKB; n=401,167). Using 2019 National Health Interview Survey data, we constructed selection weights for AOU and MGI to be more representative of the US adult population. We used weights previously developed for UKB to represent the UKB-eligible population. We conducted four common descriptive and analytic tasks comparing unweighted and weighted results. For AOU and MGI, estimated phecode prevalences decreased after weighting (weighted-unweighted median phecode prevalence ratio [MPR]: 0.82 and 0.61), while UKB's estimates increased (MPR: 1.06). Weighting minimally impacted latent phenome dimensionality estimation. Comparing weighted versus unweighted PheWAS for colorectal cancer, the strongest associations remained unaltered and there was large overlap in significant hits. Weighting affected the estimated log-odds ratio for sex and colorectal cancer to align more closely with national registry-based estimates. Weighting had limited impact on dimensionality estimation and large-scale hypothesis testing but impacted prevalence and association estimation more. Results from untargeted association analyses should be followed by weighted analysis when effect size estimation is of interest for specific signals. EHR-linked biobanks should report recruitment and selection mechanisms and provide selection weights with defined target populations. Researchers should consider their intended estimands, specify source and target populations, and weight EHR-linked biobank analyses accordingly.","Salvatore, Maxwell; Kundu, Ritoban; Shi, Xu; Friese, Christopher R; Lee, Seunggeun; Fritsche, Lars G; Mondul, Alison M; Hanauer, David; Pearce, Celeste Leigh; Mukherjee, Bhramar",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024,,ICD codes; biobank; electronic health records; phenome; selection bias,"Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Center for Improving Patient and Population Health, School of Nursing, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Health Management and Policy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Graduate School of Data Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Learning Health Sciences, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.",10.1101/2024.02.12.24302710
UK Biobank,39482694,Informatics assessment of COVID-19 data collection: an analysis of UK Biobank questionnaire data.,"There have been many efforts to expand existing data collection initiatives to include COVID-19 related data. One program that expanded is UK Biobank, a large-scale research and biomedical data collection resource that added several COVID-19 related data fields including questionnaires (exposures and symptoms), viral testing, and serological data. This study aimed to analyze this COVID-19 data to understand how COVID-19 data was collected and how it can be used to attribute COVID-19 and analyze differences in cohorts and time periods. A cohort of COVID-19 infected individuals was defined from the UK Biobank population using viral testing, diagnosis, and self-reported data. Changes over time, from March 2020 to October 2021, in total case counts and changes in case counts by identification source (diagnosis from EHR, measurement from viral testing and self-reported from questionnaire) were also analyzed. For the questionnaires, an analysis of the structure and dynamics of the questionnaires was done which included the amount and type of questions asked, how often and how many individuals answered the questions and what responses were given. In addition, the amount of individuals who provided responses regarding different time segments covered by the questionnaire was calculated along with how often responses changed. The analysis included changes in population level responses over time. The analyses were repeated for COVID and non-COVID individuals and compared responses. There were 62 042 distinct participants who had COVID-19, with 49 120 identified through diagnosis, 30 553 identified through viral testing and 934 identified through self-reporting, with many identified in multiple methods. This included vast changes in overall cases and distribution of case data source over time. 6 899 of 9 952 participants completing the exposure questionnaire responded regarding every time period covered by the questionnaire including large changes in response over time. The most common change came for employment situation, which was changed by 74.78% of individuals from the first to last time of asking. On a population level, there were changes as face mask usage increased each successive time period. There were decreases in nearly every COVID-19 symptom from the first to the second questionnaire. When comparing COVID to non-COVID participants, COVID participants were more commonly keyworkers (COVID: 33.76%, non-COVID: 15.00%) and more often lived with young people attending school (61.70%, 45.32%). To develop a robust cohort of COVID-19 participants from the UK Biobank population, multiple types of data were needed. The differences based on time and exposures show the important of comprehensive data capture and the utility of COVID-19 related questionnaire data.","Mayer, Craig S",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2024,Humans; COVID-19; United Kingdom; Surveys and Questionnaires; Biological Specimen Banks; Data Collection; Female; Male; SARS-CoV-2; UK Biobank,COVID-19; Informatics; Survey Questionnaires; UK Biobank,"Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine, NIH, 8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD, 20894, USA. craig.mayer2@nih.gov.",10.1186/s12911-024-02743-5
UK Biobank,38405849,"Discover overlooked complications after preeclampsia from three real-world medical record datasets of over 100,000 pregnancies.","Preeclampsia poses a significant threat to women's long-term health. However, what diseases are affected and at what level they are affected by PE needs a thorough investigation. To conduct the first large-scale, non-hypothesis-driven study using EHR data from multiple medical centers to comprehensively explore adverse health outcomes after preeclampsia. Retrospective multi-cohort case-control study. We analyzed 3,592 preeclampsia patients and 23,040 non-preeclampsia controls from the University of Michigan Healthcare System. We externally validated the findings using UK Biobank data (443 cases, 14,870 controls) and Cedar Sinai data(2755 cases, 60,305 controls). We showed that six complications are significantly affected by PE. We demonstrate the effect of race as well as preeclampsia severity on these complications. PE significantly increases the risk of later hypertension, uncomplicated and complicated diabetes, renal failure and obesity, after careful confounder adjustment. We also identified that hypothyroidism risks are significantly reduced in PE patients, particularly among African Americans. Severe PE affects hypertension, renal failure, uncomplicated diabetes and obesity more than mild PE, as expected. Caucasians are affected more negatively than African Americans by PE on future hypertension, uncomplicated and complicated diabetes and obesity. This study fills a gap in the comprehensive assessment of preeclampsia's long-term effects using large-scale EHR data and rigorous statistical methods. Our findings emphasize the need for extended monitoring and tailored interventions for women with a history of preeclampsia, by considering pre-existing conditions, preeclampsia severity, and racial differences.","Zhu, Haoming; Yang, Xiaotong; Tao, Leyang; Xie, Wanling; Chang, Jui-Hsuan; Wang, Zhiping Paul; Langen, Elizabeth; Li, Ruowang; Gamire, Lana X",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024,,,"Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, United States of America.; Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, United States of America.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, United States of America.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, United States of America.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, United States of America.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, United States of America.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, United States of America.; Department of Computational Biomedicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, West Hollywood, CA, 90069, United States of America.; Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, United States of America.; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, United States of America.",10.1101/2023.12.05.23299296

Cohort study. 21 482 patients with acute myocardial infarction in England between January 2003 and March 2009, identified in four prospectively collected, linked electronic health record sources: Clinical Practice Research Datalink (primary care data), Hospital Episode Statistics (hospital admissions), the disease registry MINAP (Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project), and the Office for National Statistics mortality register (cause specific mortality data). One country (England) with one health system (the National Health Service). Recording of acute myocardial infarction, incidence, all cause mortality within one year of acute myocardial infarction, and diagnostic validity of acute myocardial infarction compared with electrocardiographic and troponin findings in the disease registry (gold standard). Risk factors and non-cardiovascular coexisting conditions were similar across patients identified in primary care, hospital admission, and registry sources. Immediate all cause mortality was highest among patients with acute myocardial infarction recorded in primary care, which (unlike hospital admission and disease registry sources) included patients who did not reach hospital, but at one year mortality rates in cohorts from each source were similar. 5561 (31.0%) patients with non-fatal acute myocardial infarction were recorded in all three sources and 11 482 (63.9%) in at least two sources. The crude incidence of acute myocardial infarction was underestimated by 25-50% using one source compared with using all three sources. Compared with acute myocardial infarction defined in the disease registry, the positive predictive value of acute myocardial infarction recorded in primary care was 92.2% (95% confidence interval 91.6% to 92.8%) and in hospital admissions was 91.5% (90.8% to 92.1%). Each data source missed a substantial proportion (25-50%) of myocardial infarction events.

UK Biobank,30256891,De novo pattern discovery enables robust assessment of functional consequences of non-coding variants.,"Given the complexity of genome regions, prioritize the functional effects of non-coding variants remains a challenge. Although several frameworks have been proposed for the evaluation of the functionality of non-coding variants, most of them used 'black boxes' methods that simplify the task as the pathogenicity/benign classification problem, which ignores the distinct regulatory mechanisms of variants and leads to less desirable performance. In this study, we developed DVAR, an unsupervised framework that leverage various biochemical and evolutionary evidence to distinguish the gene regulatory categories of variants and assess their comprehensive functional impact simultaneously. DVAR performed de novo pattern discovery in high-dimensional data and identified five regulatory clusters of non-coding variants. Leveraging the new insights into the multiple functional patterns, it measures both the between-class and the within-class functional implication of the variants to achieve accurate prioritization. Compared to other two-class learning methods, it showed improved performance in identification of clinically significant variants, fine-mapped GWAS variants, eQTLs and expression-modulating variants. Moreover, it has superior performance on disease causal variants verified by genome-editing (like CRISPR-Cas9), which could provide a pre-selection strategy for genome-editing technologies across the whole genome. Finally, evaluated in BioVU and UK Biobank, two large-scale DNA biobanks linked to complete electronic health records, DVAR demonstrated its effectiveness in prioritizing non-coding variants associated with medical phenotypes. The C++ and Python source codes, the pre-computed DVAR-cluster labels and DVAR-scores across the whole genome are available at https://www.vumc.org/cgg/dvar.

UK Biobank,40443420,Defining a High-Quality Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome cohort in UK Biobank.,"Progress in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) research is being slowed by the relatively small-scale studies being performed whose results are often not replicated. Progress could be accelerated by analyses of large population-scale projects, such as UK Biobank (UKB), which provide extensive phenotype and genotype data linked to both ME/CFS cases and controls. Here, we analysed the overlap and discordance among four UKB-defined ME/CFS cohorts, and additional questionnaire data when available. A total of 5,354 UKB individuals were linked to at least one piece of evidence of MECFS, a higher proportion (1.1%) than most prevalence estimates. Only a third (36%; n=1,922) had 2 or more pieces of evidence for MECFS, in part due to data missingness. For the same UKB participant, ME/CFS status defined by ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) code G93.3 (Post-viral fatigue syndrome) was most likely to be supported by another data type (72%); ME/CFS status defined by Pain Questionnaire responses is least likely to be supported (43%), in part due to data missingness. We conclude that ME/CFS status in UKB, and potentially other biobanks, is best supported by multiple, and not single, lines of evidence. Finally, we raise the estimated ME/CFS prevalence in the UK to 410,000 using the most consistent evidence for ME/CFS status, and accounting for those who had no opportunity to participate in UKB due to being bed- or house-bound. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a highly debilitating and relatively common disease whose causes are unknown. Most of its research compares features (symptoms, molecules, cells or genes, for example) from small numbers of people with ME/CFS, against these features from others without the disease. Studies using small sample sizes have not yielded replicated discoveries that would quicken the pace of ME/CFS research towards effective therapies. Alternatively, ME/CFS research could take advantage of population-scale bioresources, such as the UK Biobank, which holds diverse genetic, molecular, cellular, imaging and questionnaire data on nearly 500,000 individuals. This has the added advantage of being cheaper than recruiting a new cohort, and generating new data. For ME/CFS, this approach raises the difficulty of how to best categorise people with this disease, for example by questionnaire response or through linked electronic health records. In the UK Biobank, there are four ways to categorise people with ME/CFS. This study’s results show that just over 1% of the UK Biobank participants could be categorised as having a ME/CFS medical diagnosis. However, not all evidence for their ME/CFS diagnosis is consistent. By cross-referencing different data in UK Biobank, we show that a participant’s ME/CFS diagnosis is best supported by two or more lines of evidence. Using the most consistent evidence, and accounting for those who – due to their illness – could not participate in the UK Biobank, we estimate that the UK’s prevalence of ME/CFS is 410,000.","Samms, Gemma L; Ponting, Chris P",NIHR open research,2025,,Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome prevalence; Population bioresource; Electronic health records; Post-viral fatigue syndrome,"Institute of Genetics and Cancer, The University of Edinburgh MRC Human Genetics Unit, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.; Institute of Genetics and Cancer, The University of Edinburgh MRC Human Genetics Unit, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.",10.3310/nihropenres.13956.1

Socioeconomic status (SES) was assessed using the Townsend Deprivation Index. Smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, sleep duration, leisure activities, dietary score, and obesity were used to construct the overall lifestyle risk score. Cox proportional hazard regression models, mediation and moderation analysis and multiple sensitivity analyses were used. During a median follow-up of 8.94 years, 13,344 participants (4.46 %) developed depression.

UK Biobank,40361167,Joint models in big data: simulation-based guidelines for required data quality in longitudinal electronic health records.,"Over the past decade an increase in usage of electronic health data (EHR) by office-based physicians and hospitals has been reported. However, these data types come with challenge regarding completeness and data quality and it is, especially for more complex models, unclear how these characteristics influence the performance. In this paper, we focus on joint models which combines longitudinal modelling with survival modelling to incorporate all available information. The aim of this paper is to establish simulation-based guidelines for the necessary quality of longitudinal EHR data so that joint models perform better than cox models. We conducted an extensive simulation study by systematically and transparently varying different characteristics of data quality, e.g., measurement frequency, noise, and heterogeneity between patients. We apply the joint models and evaluate their performance relative to traditional Cox survival modelling techniques. Key findings suggest that biomarker changes before disease onset must be consistent within similar patient groups. With increasing noise and a higher measurement density, the joint model surpasses the traditional Cox regression model in terms of model performance. We illustrate the usefulness and limitations of the guidelines with two real-world examples, namely the influence of serum bilirubin on primary biliary liver cirrhosis and the influence of the estimated glomerular filtration rate on chronic kidney disease.","Hunsdieck, Berit; Bender, Christian; Ickstadt, Katja; Mielke, Johanna",BioData mining,2025,,Chronic kidney disease; Joint modelling; Longitudinal data application; Primary care data; Simulation study,"Computational Biology, Bayer AG, Wuppertal, Germany. berit.hunsdieck@bayer.com.; Department of Statistics, TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany. berit.hunsdieck@bayer.com.; Computational Biology, Bayer AG, Wuppertal, Germany.; Department of Statistics, TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany.; Lamarr-Institute for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Dortmund, Germany.; Computational Biology, Bayer AG, Wuppertal, Germany.",10.1186/s13040-025-00450-z

We aimed to prospectively explore the association between dietary fiber intake and the risk of IBD-related surgery. We identified 5580 individuals with diagnosed IBD [Crohn disease (CD, n = 1908) and ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 3672)] at baseline in the UK Biobank via electronic medical records and self-reported information. Dietary fiber intake was estimated by a partial fiber score derived from a valid food frequency questionnaire. IBD-related surgery (enterotomy, perianal surgery, and others) was ascertained via inpatient data. Cox proportional model was applied to estimate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of dietary fiber in quartiles for the risk of IBD-related surgery. During a mean follow-up period of 11.2 y, we documented 624 IBD-related surgery among 5580 individuals with IBD (mean age, 57.3; 52.8% females). Compared with individuals in the lowest quartiles, those with second to fourth quartiles of fiber intake were associated with 23% (95% CI: 5%, 38%, P = 0.015), 29% (95% CI: 11%, 43%, P = 0.003), and 28% (95% CI: 10%, 43%, P = 0.005) reduced risk (P-trend = 0.002) of IBD-related surgery. Similar associations were observed in CD (P-trend = 0.005) but not UC (P-trend = 0.131). We observed inverse associations of fiber in vegetables and fruits (P-trend = 0.017 and 0.007) but positive associations of fiber in bread (P-trend = 0.046) with the risk of IBD-related surgery.

UK Biobank,34140970,"A Compendium of Age-Related PheWAS and GWAS Traits for Human Genetic Association Studies, Their Networks and Genetic Correlations.","The rich data from the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) offer an unprecedented opportunity to identify the biological underpinnings of age-related disease (ARD) risk and multimorbidity. Surprisingly, however, a comprehensive list of ARDs remains unavailable due to the lack of a clear definition and selection criteria. We developed a method to identify ARDs and to provide a compendium of ARDs for genetic association studies. Querying 1,358 electronic medical record-derived traits, we first defined ARDs and age-related traits (ARTs) based on their prevalence profiles, requiring a unimodal distribution that shows an increasing prevalence after the age of 40 years, and which reaches a maximum peak at 60 years of age or later. As a result, we identified a list of 463 ARDs and ARTs in the GWAS and PheWAS catalogs. We next translated the ARDs and ARTs to their respective 276 Medical Subject Headings diseases and 45 anatomy terms. The most abundant disease categories are neoplasms (48 terms), cardiovascular diseases (44 terms), and nervous system diseases (27 terms). Employing data from a human symptoms-disease network, we found 6 symptom-shared disease groups, representing cancers, heart diseases, brain diseases, joint diseases, eye diseases, and mixed diseases. Lastly, by overlaying our ARD and ART list with genetic correlation data from the UK Biobank, we found 54 phenotypes in 2 clusters with high genetic correlations. Our compendium of ARD and ART is a highly useful resource, with broad applicability for studies of the genetics of aging, ARD, and multimorbidity.","Kim, Seung-Soo; Hudgins, Adam D; Gonzalez, Brenda; Milman, Sofiya; Barzilai, Nir; Vijg, Jan; Tu, Zhidong; Suh, Yousin",Frontiers in genetics,2021,,GWAS; age-related disease; age-related trait; aging; biomarker,"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States.; Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States.; Institute for Aging Research, Department of Medicine and Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States.; Institute for Aging Research, Department of Medicine and Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States.; Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.; Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United States.",10.3389/fgene.2021.680560
UK Biobank,39028453,"Association between adult education, brain volume and dementia risk: longitudinal cohort study of UK Biobank participants.","Less childhood education is a potentially modifiable risk factor for developing incident dementia but it is not known if education in later life is protective. We sought to add to previous work by testing the association between adult education and brain volume as well as exploring the impact of continuing adult education versus intermittent participation. We used data from participants of the UK Biobank cohort, with no prevalent dementia who were asked about adult education participation at baseline and at follow-up. Dementia status was ascertained from self-report or electronic health records. Cox proportional hazards models were built to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) between participation in adult education and dementia risk. In 499,337 participants aged between 40 and 69 at baseline with 13.2 years mean follow-up, in analyses adjusted for age, sex, education, deprivation, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, ethnicity, obesity, smoking, alcohol use, physical inactivity and social isolation, we replicated previous findings of a protective effect of adult education on dementia risk (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.90, P < 0.001), and showed a trend towards protection against dementia if adult education was continued rather than intermittent. Additionally, adult education did not impact on total brain volume (coefficient - 657.4, 95% CI - 2795.1 to 1480.3, P = 0.547) but it was associated with increased hippocampal volume (coefficient 33.9, 95% CI 8.9 to 59.0, P = 0.008) indicating a potential mechanism for protection against dementia. We have added evidence indicating that continuing adult education participation may be beneficial, although numbers for this analysis were very small. Analysis of brain volume indicated that adult education may have a protective effect by preserving hippocampal size or slowing volume loss, in line with the cognitive reserve hypothesis.","Jin, Jiayin; Sommerlad, Andrew; Mukadam, Naaheed",GeroScience,2025,Humans; Dementia; Male; Female; United Kingdom; Longitudinal Studies; Middle Aged; Educational Status; Aged; Risk Factors; Adult; Brain; Organ Size; Proportional Hazards Models; Biological Specimen Banks; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; UK Biobank,Cohort; Dementia; Education; Risk,"Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, UK.; Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK.; Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.; Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK. n.mukadam@ucl.ac.uk.; Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. n.mukadam@ucl.ac.uk.",10.1007/s11357-024-01285-y

Our framework condenses these summary statistics into PRSs using various approaches such as linkage disequilibrium pruning/p value thresholding (fixed or data-adaptively optimized thresholds) and penalized, genome-wide effect size weighting. We evaluated the PRSs in two biobanks: the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a longitudinal biorepository effort at Michigan Medicine, and the population-based UK Biobank (UKB). For each PRS construct, we provide measures on predictive performance and discrimination. Besides PRS evaluation, the Cancer-PRSweb platform features construct downloads and phenome-wide PRS association study results (PRS-PheWAS) for predictive PRSs. We expect this integrated platform to accelerate PRS-related cancer research.","Fritsche, Lars G; Patil, Snehal; Beesley, Lauren J; VandeHaar, Peter; Salvatore, Maxwell; Ma, Ying; Peng, Robert B; Taliun, Daniel; Zhou, Xiang; Mukherjee, Bhramar",American journal of human genetics,2020,"Adult; Aged; Biological Specimen Banks; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome, Human; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Humans; Internet; Linkage Disequilibrium; Male; Middle Aged; Multifactorial Inheritance; Neoplasms; Phenotype; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Risk Factors; United Kingdom; United States",EHR; GWAS; PRS; PheWAS; cancer genetics; complex traits; electronic health records; genome-wide association studies; phenome-wide association studies; polygenic risk scores,"Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Center for Statistical Genetics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Center for Precision Health Data Science, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.

UK Biobank,34945853,A Network-Based Analysis of Disease Complication Associations for Obstetric Disorders in the UK Biobank.,"Recent studies have found that women with obstetric disorders are at increased risk for a variety of long-term complications. However, the underlying pathophysiology of these connections remains undetermined. A network-based view incorporating knowledge of other diseases and genetic associations will aid our understanding of the role of genetics in pregnancy-related disease complications. We built a disease-disease network (DDN) using UK Biobank (UKBB) summary data from a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to elaborate multiple disease associations. We also constructed egocentric DDNs, where each network focuses on a pregnancy-related disorder and its neighboring diseases. We then applied graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) to translate the connections in the egocentric DDNs to pathologic knowledge. A total of 26 egocentric DDNs were constructed for each pregnancy-related phenotype in the UKBB. Applying GSSL to each DDN, we obtained complication risk scores for additional phenotypes given the pregnancy-related disease of interest. Predictions were validated using co-occurrences derived from UKBB electronic health records. Our proposed method achieved an increase in average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) by a factor of 1.35 from 55.0% to 74.4% compared to the use of the full DDN. Egocentric DDNs hold promise as a clinical tool for the network-based identification of potential disease complications for a variety of phenotypes.","Sriram, Vivek; Nam, Yonghyun; Shivakumar, Manu; Verma, Anurag; Jung, Sang-Hyuk; Lee, Seung Mi; Kim, Dokyoon",Journal of personalized medicine,2021,,PheWAS; disease complication; disease–disease network; network medicine; obstetric disorders; pregnancy-related complications; semi-supervised learning,"Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Genomics and Computational Biology Graduate Group, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Genomics and Computational Biology Graduate Group, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Digital Health, SAIHST, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul 06351, Korea.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Korea.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.",10.3390/jpm11121382

Their co-occurrence complicates clinical outcomes, increasing mortality and symptom severity. In this study, we investigated the association of insulin resistance-related conditions and related polygenic scores (PGSs) with MDD clinical profile and treatment outcomes, using primary care records from UK Biobank. We identified MDD cases and insulin resistance-related conditions, as well as measures of depression treatment outcomes (e.g. resistance) from the records. Clinical-demographic variables were derived from self-reports, and insulin resistance-related PGSs were calculated using PRS-CS. Univariable analyses were conducted to compare sociodemographic and clinical variables of MDD cases with (IR+) and without (IR-) lifetime insulin resistance-related conditions. Multiple regressions were performed to identify factors, including insulin resistance-related PGSs, potentially associated with treatment outcomes, adjusting for confounders. Among 30 919 MDD cases, 51.95% were IR+. These had more antidepressant prescriptions and classes utilisation and longer treatment duration than patients without insulin resistance-related conditions ( Our findings support an integrated treatment approach, prioritising both psychiatric and metabolic health, and public health strategies aimed at early intervention and prevention of insulin resistance in MDD.","Fanelli, Giuseppe; Bralten, Janita; Franke, Barbara; Roth Mota, Nina; Atti, Anna Rita; De Ronchi, Diana; Monteleone, Alessio Maria; Grassi, Luigi; Serretti, Alessandro; Fabbri, Chiara",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,2025,,Treatment-resistant depression (TRD); coronary artery disease (CAD); electronic health care records (EHR); multimorbidity; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI),"Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.; Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.; Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.; Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.; Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.; Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.; Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.; Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.; Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.; Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli', Naples, Italy.; Department of Neuroscience and Rehabilitation, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.; Department of Medicine and Surgery, Kore University of Enna, Enna, Italy.; Oasi Research Institute-IRCCS, Troina, Italy.; Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.",10.1192/bjp.2025.82

We examined associations of genetically predicted Lp(a) levels with (1) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease subtypes: coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm and (2) nonatherosclerotic cardiovascular disease phenotypes, stratified by ancestry. We performed (1) Mendelian randomization analyses for previously reported cardiovascular associations and (2) Mendelian randomization-phenome-wide association analyses for novel associations. Analyses were stratified by ancestry in electronic Medical Records and Genomics, United Kingdom Biobank, and Million Veteran Program cohorts separately and in a combined cohort of 804 507 EA and 103 580 AA participants. In Mendelian randomization analyses using the combined cohort, a 1-SD genetic increase in Lp(a) level was associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease subtypes in EA-odds ratio and 95% CI for coronary heart disease 1.28 (1.16-1.41); cerebrovascular disease 1.14 (1.07-1.21); peripheral artery disease 1.22 (1.11-1.34); abdominal aortic aneurysm 1.28 (1.17-1.40); in AA, the effect estimate was lower than in EA and nonsignificant for coronary heart disease 1.11 (0.99-1.24) and cerebrovascular disease 1.06 (0.99-1.14) but similar for peripheral artery disease 1.16 (1.01-1.33) and abdominal aortic aneurysm 1.34 (1.11-1.62). In EA, a 1-SD genetic increase in Lp(a) level was associated with aortic valve disorders 1.34 (1.10-1.62), mitral valve disorders 1.18 (1.09-1.27), congestive heart failure 1.12 (1.05-1.19), and chronic kidney disease 1.07 (1.01-1.14). In AA, no significant associations were noted for aortic valve disorders 1.08 (0.94-1.25), mitral valve disorders 1.02 (0.89-1.16), congestive heart failure 1.02 (0.95-1.10), or chronic kidney disease 1.05 (0.99-1.12). Mendelian randomization-phenome-wide association analyses identified novel associations in EA with arterial thromboembolic disease, nonaortic aneurysmal disease, atrial fibrillation, cardiac conduction disorders, and hypertension. Many cardiovascular associations of genetically increased Lp(a) that were significant in EA were not significant in AA.

UK Biobank,39988343,Association of single and multiple cardiometabolic diseases with atrial fibrillation: a prospective cohort study.,"Individual cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) increase atrial fibrillation (AF) risk; however, whether multiple CMDs exert a cumulative effect on AF risk remains unclear. Our objective was to examine the link between coexisting CMDs and AF, as well as their cumulative impact. This UK Biobank-based prospective cohort study included data from participants with information related to CMDs and AF. The assessment of CMDs and AF was based on participants' self-reported medical histories and electronic health records. Cox proportional hazard regression models were employed to analyse the link between the number of CMDs and AF and to determine the cumulative effect of multiple CMDs. Further, we performed stratified analyses and adjusted for confounding factors. The study included 308 916 participants. The risk of AF was substantially associated with varying numbers of CMDs after multivariable adjustment in comparison to the reference group (all p<0.001). In the fully adjusted model, participants with 1, 2 and ≥3 CMDs exhibited elevated risks of 54% (HR: 1.54, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.59), 104% (HR: 2.04, 95% CI 1.94 to 2.15) and 212% (HR: 3.12, 95% CI 2.87 to 3.38), respectively. A significant cumulative dose-response relationship was noted between the number of CMDs and AF risk (HR: 1.45, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.48, p<0.001). A consistent dose-dependent cumulative relationship was observed in both stratified and sensitivity analyses. Multiple CMDs increased AF risk and exhibited a significant cumulative effect based on the number of CMDs.","Peng, Qunyong; Ma, Tianqi; Gao, Ming; Wang, Xuerui; Pan, Wei",Open heart,2025,Humans; Atrial Fibrillation; Prospective Studies; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; United Kingdom; Aged; Incidence; Risk Factors; Metabolic Diseases; Follow-Up Studies,Atrial Fibrillation; Global Health; Risk Factors,"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.; Center of Coronary Circulation, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.; National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.; Center of Coronary Circulation, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.; National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.; Department of Geriatric Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.; Center of Coronary Circulation, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.; National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.; Department of Geriatric Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.; Center of Coronary Circulation, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.; National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.; National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China panwei1007@163.com.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.",10.1136/openhrt-2024-003034

UK Biobank,39896928,Building ADMISSION - A research collaborative to transform understanding of multiple long-term conditions for people admitted to hospital.,"Multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs; commonly referred to as multimorbidity) are highly prevalent among people admitted to hospital and are therefore of critical importance to hospital-based healthcare systems. To date, most research on MLTCs has been conducted in primary care or the general population with comparatively little work undertaken in the hospital setting. To describe the rationale and content of ADMISSION: a four-year UK Research and Innovation and National Institute of Health and Care Research funded interdisciplinary programme that seeks, in partnership with public contributors, to transform care for people living with MLTCs admitted to hospital. Based across five UK academic centres, ADMISSION combines expertise in clinical medicine, epidemiology, informatics, computing, biostatistics, social science, genetics and care pathway mapping to examine patterns of conditions, mechanisms, consequences and pathways of care for people with MLTCs admitted to hospital. The programme uses routinely collected electronic health record data from large UK teaching hospitals, population-based cohort data from UK Biobank and routinely collected blood samples from The Scottish Health Research Register and Biobank (SHARE). These approaches are complemented by focused qualitative work exploring the perspectives of healthcare professionals and the lived experience of people with MLTCs admitted to hospital. ADMISSION will provide the necessary foundations to develop novel ways to prevent and treat MLTCs and their consequences in people admitted to hospital and to improve care systems and the quality of care for this underserved group.","Witham, Miles D;

UK Biobank,30645594,No causal effects of serum urate levels on the risk of chronic kidney disease: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Studies have shown strong positive associations between serum urate (SU) levels and chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk; however, whether the relation is causal remains uncertain. We evaluate whether genetic data are consistent with a causal impact of SU level on the risk of CKD and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We used Mendelian randomization (MR) methods to evaluate the presence of a causal effect. We used aggregated genome-wide association data (N = 110,347 for SU, N = 69,374 for gout, N = 133,413 for eGFR, N = 117,165 for CKD), electronic-medical-record-linked UK Biobank data (N = 335,212), and population-based cohorts (N = 13,425), all in individuals of European ancestry, for SU levels and CKD. Our MR analysis showed that SU has a causal effect on neither eGFR level nor CKD risk across all MR analyses (all P > 0.05). These null associations contrasted with our epidemiological association findings from the 4 population-based cohorts (change in eGFR level per 1-mg/dl [59.48 μmol/l] increase in SU: -1.99 ml/min/1.73 m2; 95% CI -2.86 to -1.11; P = 8.08 × 10(-6); odds ratio [OR] for CKD: 1.48; 95% CI 1.32 to 1.65; P = 1.52 × 10(-11)). In contrast, the same MR approaches showed that SU has a causal effect on the risk of gout (OR estimates ranging from 3.41 to 6.04 per 1-mg/dl increase in SU, all P < 10-3), which served as a positive control of our approach. Overall, our MR analysis had >99% power to detect a causal effect of SU level on the risk of CKD of the same magnitude as the observed epidemiological association between SU and CKD. Limitations of this study include the lifelong effect of a genetic perturbation not being the same as an acute perturbation, the inability to study non-European populations, and some sample overlap between the datasets used in the study. Evidence from our series of causal inference approaches using genetics does not support a causal effect of SU level on eGFR level or CKD risk. Reducing SU levels is unlikely to reduce the risk of CKD development.","Jordan, Daniel M; Choi, Hyon K; Verbanck, Marie; Topless, Ruth; Won, Hong-Hee; Nadkarni, Girish; Merriman, Tony R; Do, Ron",PLoS medicine,2019,"Adult; Age Factors; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Sex Factors; Uric Acid; Young Adult",,"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.; Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.; Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.; Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.; Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.; Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, South Korea.; Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.; Department of Nephrology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.; Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.; Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States of America.",10.1371/journal.pmed.1002725

UK Biobank,39846171,Evaluation of a Machine Learning-Guided Strategy for Elevated Lipoprotein(a) Screening in Health Systems.,"While universal screening for Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is increasingly recommended, <0.5% of patients undergo Lp(a) testing. Here, we assessed the feasibility of deploying Algorithmic Risk Inspection for Screening Elevated Lp(a) (ARISE), a validated machine learning tool, to health system electronic health records to increase the yield of Lp(a) testing. We randomly sampled 100 000 patients from the Yale-New Haven Health System to evaluate the feasibility of ARISE deployment. We also evaluated Lp(a)-tested populations in the Yale-New Haven Health System (n=7981) and the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (n=10 635) to assess the association of ARISE score with elevated Lp(a). To compare the representativeness of the Lp(a)-tested population, we included 456 815 participants from the UK Biobank and 23 280 from 3 US-based cohorts of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities, Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults, and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Among 100 000 randomly selected Yale-New Haven Health System patients, 413 (0.4%) had undergone Lp(a) measurement. ARISE score could be computed for 31 586 patients based on existing data, identifying 2376 (7.5%) patients with a high probability of elevated Lp(a). A positive ARISE score was associated with significantly higher odds of elevated Lp(a) in the Yale-New Haven Health System (odds ratio, 1.87 [95% CI, 1.65-2.12]) and the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (odds ratio, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.24-1.60]). The Lp(a)-tested population significantly differed from other study cohorts in terms of ARISE features. We demonstrate the feasibility of deployment of ARISE in US health systems to define the risk of elevated Lp(a), enabling a high-yield testing strategy. We also confirm the markedly low adoption of Lp(a) testing, which is also being restricted to a highly selected population.","Aminorroaya, Arya; Dhingra, Lovedeep S; Oikonomou, Evangelos K; Khera, Rohan",Circulation.

In this study, we used a phenome wide association study (PheWAS) approach to identify cross-phenotype between previously identified genetic associations for AD and electronic health record (EHR) diagnoses from the UK Biobank (UKBB) (n=361,194 of European ancestry) and the eMERGE Network (n=105,108 of diverse ancestry). Based on 497 previously identified AD-associated variants from the Alzheimer's Disease Variant Portal (ADVP), we found significant associations primarily in immune and cardiac related diseases in our PheWAS. Replicating variants have widespread impacts on immune genes in diverse tissue types. This study demonstrates the potential of using the PheWAS strategy to improve our understanding of AD progression as well as identify potential drug repurposing opportunities for new treatment and disease prevention strategies.","Moore, Anni; Ritchie, Marylyn D",AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings.

UK Biobank,38886520,The associations of leukocyte telomere length and intermediary cardiovascular phenotype with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in the white population.,"The evidence about the associations of leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and intermediary cardiovascular phenotypes with adverse cardiovascular outcomes is inconclusive. This study assessed these relationships with cardiovascular imaging, electrocardiography, and the risks of sudden cardiac death (SCD), coronary events, and heart failure (HF) admission. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of UK Biobank participants enrolled between 2006 and 2010. LTL was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reactions. Electronic health records were used to determine the incidence of SCD, coronary events, and HF admission. Cardiovascular measurements were made using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning. The associations of LTL with SCD, coronary events, and HF admission and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, electrocardiogram parameters of 33,043 and 19,554 participants were evaluated by multivariate regression. The median (interquartile range) follow-up period was 11.9 (11.2-12.6) years. Data was analyzed from January to May 2023. Among the 403,382 white participants without coronary artery disease or HF, 181,637 (45.0%) were male with a mean age of 57.1 years old. LTL was independently negatively associated with a risk of SCD (LTL third quartile vs first quartile: hazard ratio [HR]: 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72-0.92), coronary events (LTL third quartile vs first quartile: HR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.92), and HF admission (LTL fourth quartile vs first quartile: HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.74-0.95). LTL was also independently positively associated with cardiac remodeling, specifically left ventricular mass index, left-ventricular-end systolic and diastolic volumes, mean left ventricular myocardial wall thickness, left ventricular stroke volume, and with electrocardiogram changes along the negative degree of T-axis. Cross-sectional study results showed that LTL was positively associated with heart size and cardiac function in middle age, but electrocardiography results did not show these associations, which could explain the negative association between LTL and risk of SCD, coronary events, and HF admission in UK Biobank participants.","Chung, Ho-Gi; Yang, Pil-Sung; Cho, Seunghoon; Jang, Eunsun; Kim, Daehoon; Yu, Hee Tae; Kim, Tae-Hoon; Uhm, Jae-Sun; Sung, Jung-Hoon; Pak, Hui-Nam; Lee, Moon-Hyoung; Joung, Boyoung",Scientific reports,2024,"Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Leukocytes; Cross-Sectional Studies; Telomere; Phenotype; Aged; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Heart Failure; White People; Telomere Homeostasis; Electrocardiography; Risk Factors; United Kingdom; Cardiovascular Diseases",Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Coronary event; Electrocardiogram; Heart failure; Leukocyte telomere length; Sudden cardiac death,"Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Cardiovascular Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.; Department of Cardiology, CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University, Seongnam, South Korea.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Cardiovascular Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Cardiovascular Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Cardiovascular Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Cardiovascular Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Cardiovascular Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Cardiovascular Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.; Department of Cardiology, CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University, Seongnam, South Korea.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Cardiovascular Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Cardiovascular Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea.; Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Cardiovascular Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, 03722, South Korea. cby6908@yuhs.ac.",10.1038/s41598-024-64997-3

Mendelian randomization phenome-wide association study (MR-PheWAS) from the UK Biobank. A polygenic risk score (PRS) for age at the onset of myopia was constructed using 80 variants selected from a genome-wide association study. Participants were eligible if they had available genetic information during recruitment between March 13, 2006, and October 1, 2010. Disease outcomes were mapped to phenotype codes (phecodes) based on hospital episode statistics and causes of death up to April 29, 2021. The analysis of phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) identified possible associations between the age of myopia-onset PRS and a range of disease outcomes. Cox proportional hazards analysis and 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) further confirmed associations between PRS and diseases passing Bonferroni correction. The disease-trajectory analysis explored the sequential patterns in childhood-onset and adult-onset groups. Disease outcomes related to age at the onset of myopia. Our study population comprised 315 568 UK Biobank participants, and 1000 unique phecodes from 17 different disease categories were included for analysis. After Bonferroni correction, PheWAS identified younger age at myopia-onset PRS was associated with hospital-diagnosed myopia and 13 other outcomes when using the Bonferroni threshold (all  This data-driven MR-PheWAS identified a range of ocular disorders and hypothyroidism that were related to age at the onset of myopia.

UK Biobank,31879980,Ordered multinomial regression for genetic association analysis of ordinal phenotypes at Biobank scale.,"Logistic regression is the primary analysis tool for binary traits in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Multinomial regression extends logistic regression to multiple categories. However, many phenotypes more naturally take ordered, discrete values. Examples include (a) subtypes defined from multiple sources of clinical information and (b) derived phenotypes generated by specific phenotyping algorithms for electronic health records (EHR). GWAS of ordinal traits have been problematic. Dichotomizing can lead to a range of arbitrary cutoff values, generating inconsistent, hard to interpret results. Using multinomial regression ignores trait value hierarchy and potentially loses power. Treating ordinal data as quantitative can lead to misleading inference. To address these issues, we analyze ordinal traits with an ordered, multinomial model. This approach increases power and leads to more interpretable results. We derive efficient algorithms for computing test statistics, making ordinal trait GWAS computationally practical for Biobank scale data. Our method is available as a Julia package OrdinalGWAS.jl. Application to a COPDGene study confirms previously found signals based on binary case-control status, but with more significance. Additionally, we demonstrate the capability of our package to run on UK Biobank data by analyzing hypertension as an ordinal trait.","German, Christopher A; Sinsheimer, Janet S; Klimentidis, Yann C; Zhou, Hua; Zhou, Jin J",Genetic epidemiology,2020,"Algorithms; Biological Specimen Banks; Case-Control Studies; Computer Simulation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Hypertension; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Regression Analysis; Respiratory Function Tests",electronic health record; genome-wide association study; ordered multinomial regression,"Department of Biostatistics, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, California.; Department of Biostatistics, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, California.; Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California.; Department of Computational Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.; Department of Biostatistics, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, California.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.",10.1002/gepi.22276

In Phase 1, individuals aged between 35 and 55 years, living in the East and West of Scotland will be invited to participate, along with at least one (and preferably more) siblings and any other first degree relatives aged 18 or over. The total initial sample size will be 15,000 and it is planned that this will increase to 50,000 in Phase 2. All participants will be asked to contribute blood samples from which DNA will be extracted and stored for future investigation. The information from the DNA, along with answers to a life-style and medical history questionnaire, clinical and biochemical measurements taken at the time of donation, and subsequent health developments over the life course (traced through electronic health records) will be stored and used for research purposes. In addition, a detailed public consultation process will begin that will allow respondents' views to shape and develop the study. This is an important aspect to the research, and forms the continuation of a long-term parallel engagement process. As well as gene identification, the family-based study design will allow measurement of the heritability and familial aggregation of relevant quantitative traits, and the study of how genetic effects may vary by parent-of-origin. Long-term potential outcomes of this research include the targeting of disease prevention and treatment, and the development of screening tools based on the new genetic information. This study approach is complementary to other population-based genetic epidemiology studies, such as UK Biobank, which are established primarily to characterise genes and genetic risk in the population.","Smith, Blair H; Campbell, Harry; Blackwood, Douglas; Connell, John; Connor, Mike; Deary, Ian J; Dominiczak, Anna F; Fitzpatrick, Bridie; Ford, Ian; Jackson, Cathy; Haddow, Gillian; Kerr, Shona; Lindsay, Robert; McGilchrist, Mark; Morton, Robin; Murray, Graeme; Palmer, Colin N A; Pell, Jill P; Ralston, Stuart H; St Clair, David; Sullivan, Frank; Watt, Graham; Wolf, Roland; Wright, Alan; Porteous, David; Morris, Andrew D",BMC medical genetics,2006,"Adolescent; Adult; Bioethical Issues; Cohort Studies; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Databases, Genetic; Epidemiologic Research Design; Family Health; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Research; Genetic Variation; Humans; Middle Aged; Patient Selection; Pilot Projects; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Scotland; Surveys and Questionnaires",,"University of Aberdeen, Department of General Practice and Primary Care, Foresterhill Health Centre, Westburn Road, Aberdeen, UK. blairsmith@abdn.ac.uk",10.1186/1471-2350-7-74
UK Biobank,40313276,Phenome-wide comorbidity network analysis reveals clinical risk patterns in enthesopathy and enthesitis.,"Enthesopathy and enthesitis, including rotator cuff disease and other tendon disorders, represent a heterogeneous group of musculoskeletal conditions with complex etiologies. Understanding how systemic health profiles influence their onset remains a critical challenge in musculoskeletal medicine. We conducted a large-scale, phenome-wide comorbidity analysis using longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) from 432,757 UK Biobank participants. Incident cases of peripheral enthesopathies were compared to controls across 434 baseline disease phenotypes. A directed ego network was constructed to link significantly associated comorbidities to the target condition using odds ratio-based associations. Unsupervised clustering via UMAP and DBSCAN identified data-driven comorbidity clusters, which were consolidated into unified endotypes-interpreted as distinct systemic profiles contributing to disease risk. Additionally, metapath-based trajectory analysis was applied to uncover temporally structured multimorbidity chains leading to disease onset. We identified 183 baseline conditions significantly associated with the future development of enthesopathy (FDR < 0.05). Network clustering revealed eight comorbidity clusters, which were consolidated into four unified endotypes: Metabolic-Psychosomatic, Inflammatory-Multisystem, Mechanical-Injury-driven, and Aging-Intervention-related. Metapath analysis uncovered common three-step disease trajectories, such as metabolic-infectious-musculoskeletal and inflammatory skin-to-joint progressions, highlighting potential mechanistic pathways. These endotypes showed diverse clinical features but shared biological coherence, suggesting that different systemic health profiles can converge to drive tendon-related disease. This study introduces a scalable framework for identifying systemic multimorbidity patterns underlying enthesopathy and enthesitis using phenome-wide comorbidity networks. By integrating network clustering and metapath analysis, we uncover interpretable, data-driven endotypes that may inform individualized risk assessment and targeted care strategies. These findings contribute to the growing field of biobank-scale disease modeling and offer a foundation for precision approaches in musculoskeletal medicine.","Nam, Yonghyun; Lee, Dong-Gi; Woerner, Jakob; Lee, Se-Hwan; Lee, Min Ji; Jo, Sung-Han; Jung, Jaeun; Heo, Su Chin; Jo, Chris Hyunchul; Kim, Dokyoon",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025,,,"Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.; McKay Orthopaedic Research Laboratory, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Department of Translational Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; McKay Orthopaedic Research Laboratory, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; McKay Orthopaedic Research Laboratory, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; McKay Orthopaedic Research Laboratory, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Translational Musculoskeletal Research Center, Corporal Michael J Crescenz VA Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Department of Orthopedic Surgery, SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Department of Translational Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",10.1101/2025.04.21.25326169
UK Biobank,40510220,"Antidepressant Switching as a Proxy Phenotype for Drug Nonresponse: Investigating Clinical, Demographic, and Genetic Characteristics.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a first-line pharmacological therapy in major depressive disorder (MDD), but treatment response rates are low. Clinical trials lack the power to study the genetic contribution to SSRI response. Real-world evidence from electronic health records provides larger sample sizes, but novel response definitions are needed to accurately define SSRI nonresponders. In the UK Biobank (UKB) ( In the UKB, 5133 (13.2%) SSRI switchers and 33,680 nonswitchers were defined. The mean time to switch was 28 days (interquartile range, 17-49). Switching patterns were consistent across the UKB and Generation Scotland ( This study identified SSRI switching as a proxy for nonresponse, scalable across biobanks with electronic health records, capturing demographics and genetics of treatment nonresponse, and independent of MDD genetics. Genetics is a significant contributor to individual differences in antidepressant response. However, previous genetic studies using clinical trials have been severely underpowered to identify specific variants associated with treatment response. Leveraging electronic health records from UK Biobank and Generation Scotland, we identified switching from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the first-line antidepressant, as a scalable proxy phenotype for nonresponse. Here, we described the switching patterns and explored demographic variables associated with switching, including socioeconomic status. We also demonstrated that SSRI switching was heritable, with a genetic component that correlated with nonresponse in clinical trials, but not with the genetics of depression susceptibility.","Lo, Chris Wai Hang; Gillett, Alexandra C; Iveson, Matthew H; Kamp, Michelle; Fabbri, Chiara; Wong, Win Lee Edwin; Handley, Dale; Pain, Oliver; Vassos, Evangelos; Wray, Naomi R; Whalley, Heather C; Li, Danyang; Young, Allan H; McIntosh, Andrew M; Lewis, Cathryn M",Biological psychiatry global open science,2025,,Antidepressant response; Electronic health records; GWAS; Generation Scotland; Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); UK Biobank,"Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; National Institute for Health Research Maudsley BRC at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.; Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.; Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; National Institute for Health Research Maudsley BRC at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.; Queensland Brain Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.; Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Generation Scotland, Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.; Division of Psychiatry, Department of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.; Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Institute for Genomics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; National Institute for Health Research Maudsley BRC at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London, London, United Kingdom.; Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.",10.1016/j.bpsgos.2025.100502
UK Biobank,39716056,Evaluation of Bayesian Linear Regression derived gene set test methods.,"Gene set tests can pinpoint genes and biological pathways that exert small to moderate effects on complex diseases like Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). By aggregating genetic markers based on biological information, these tests can enhance the statistical power needed to detect genetic associations. Our goal was to develop a gene set test utilizing Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) models, which account for both linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the complex genetic architectures intrinsic to diseases, thereby increasing the detection power of genetic associations. Through a series of simulation studies, we demonstrated how the efficacy of BLR derived gene set tests is influenced by several factors, including the proportion of causal markers, the size of gene sets, the percentage of genetic variance explained by the gene set, and the genetic architecture of the traits. By using KEGG pathways, eQTLs, and regulatory elements as different kinds of gene sets with T2D results, we also assessed the performance of gene set tests in explaining more about real phenotypes. Comparing our method with other approaches, such as the gold standard MAGMA (Multi-marker Analysis of Genomic Annotation) approach, our BLR gene set test showed superior performance. Combining performance of our method in simulated and real phenotypes, this suggests that our BLR-based approach could more accurately identify genes and biological pathways underlying complex diseases.","Bai, Zhonghao; Gholipourshahraki, Tahereh; Shrestha, Merina; Hjelholt, Astrid; Hu, Sile; Kjolby, Mads; Rohde, Palle Duun; Sørensen, Peter",BMC genomics,2024,"Bayes Theorem; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Linear Models; Linkage Disequilibrium; Quantitative Trait Loci; Phenotype; Computer Simulation; Models, Genetic; Genome-Wide Association Study",BLR; Complex disease; Gene set test; Type 2 diabetes,"Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark. zhonghao.bai@qgg.au.dk.; Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Human Genetics Centre of Excellence, Novo Nordisk Research Centre Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.; Genomic Medicine, Department of Health Science and Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.; Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark. pso@qgg.au.dk.",10.1186/s12864-024-11026-2
UK Biobank,38826407,Accelerating Genome- and Phenome-Wide Association Studies using GPUs - A case study using data from the Million Veteran Program.,"The expansion of biobanks has significantly propelled genomic discoveries yet the sheer scale of data within these repositories poses formidable computational hurdles, particularly in handling extensive matrix operations required by prevailing statistical frameworks. In this work, we introduce computational optimizations to the SAIGE (Scalable and Accurate Implementation of Generalized Mixed Model) algorithm, notably employing a GPU-based distributed computing approach to tackle these challenges. We applied these optimizations to conduct a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) across 2,068 phenotypes derived from electronic health records of 635,969 diverse participants from the Veterans Affairs (VA) Million Veteran Program (MVP). Our strategies enabled scaling up the analysis to over 6,000 nodes on the Department of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) Summit High-Performance Computer (HPC), resulting in a 20-fold acceleration compared to the baseline model. We also provide a Docker container with our optimizations that was successfully used on multiple cloud infrastructures on UK Biobank and All of Us datasets where we showed significant time and cost benefits over the baseline SAIGE model.","Rodriguez, Alex;

UK Biobank,40542866,Adding salt to foods and risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and other chronic liver diseases.,"Adding salt to foods, a novel indicator for studying habitual sodium intake, has been positively associated with multiple diseases and mortality. However, little is known about its association with liver-related disorders. This study aimed to investigate the associations of adding salt to foods with risks of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This prospective cohort study included 492,265 participants from the UK Biobank without prevalent liver diseases at baseline. The frequency of adding salt to foods was collected using a self-reported question, and incident liver-related disorders were identified through electronic health records. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the outcomes. Over a median follow-up of 13 years, 7,005 incident MASLD cases, 5,546 cirrhosis cases, and 413 HCC cases occurred. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, personal history of diseases, and diet factors, the HRs (95% CIs) of MASLD across the increasing frequency of adding salt to foods were 1.00 (reference) for never/rarely, 1.08 (1.02, 1.14) for sometimes, 1.22 (1.13, 1.31) for usually, and 1.40 (1.27, 1.53) for always, with a P for trend < 0.0001. Such association was partly driven by adiposity. Also, similar positive associations were observed for cirrhosis and HCC. A higher frequency of adding salt to foods was associated with increased risks of MASLD, cirrhosis, and HCC. Reducing adding salt to foods at the table could be included in public health initiatives to promote liver health.","Zhang, Shunming; Huo, Zhenyu; Borné, Yan; Sonestedt, Emily; Qi, Lu",European journal of nutrition,2025,"Humans; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Sodium Chloride, Dietary; Risk Factors; Liver Neoplasms; United Kingdom; Fatty Liver; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Liver Cirrhosis; Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Diet; Adult; Chronic Disease; Cohort Studies",Cirrhosis; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease; Salt; Sodium,"School of Public Health, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. shunming.zhang@med.lu.se.; Nutritional Epidemiology, Department of Clinical Sciences Malmö, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden. shunming.zhang@med.lu.se.; School of Public Health, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan, Hebei,, China.; Nutritional Epidemiology, Department of Clinical Sciences Malmö, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.; Nutritional Epidemiology, Department of Clinical Sciences Malmö, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.; Department of Epidemiology, Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA. lqi1@tulane.edu.; Department of Nutrition, Harvard T.H.

In this study, we propose an innovative interpretable population graph network framework for identifying rapid progressors of AD by utilizing patient information from electronic health-related records in the UK Biobank. To achieve this, we first created a patient similarity graph, in which each AD patient is represented as a node; and an edge is established by patient clinical characteristics distance. We used graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict rapid progressors of AD and created a GNN Explainer with SHAP analysis for interpretability. The proposed model demonstrates superior predictive performance over the existing benchmark approaches. We also revealed several clinical features significantly associated with the prediction, which can be used to aid in effective interventions for the progression of AD patients.","Meng, Weimin; Inampudi, Rohit; Zhang, Xiang; Xu, Jie; Huang, Yu; Xie, Mingyi; Bian, Jiang; Yin, Rui",AMIA ...

UK Biobank,38509709,A power-based sliding window approach to evaluate the clinical impact of rare genetic variants in the nucleotide sequence or the spatial position of the folded protein.,"Systematic determination of novel variant pathogenicity remains a major challenge, even when there is an established association between a gene and phenotype. Here we present Power Window (PW), a sliding window technique that identifies the impactful regions of a gene using population-scale clinico-genomic datasets. By sizing analysis windows on the number of variant carriers, rather than the number of variants or nucleotides, statistical power is held constant, enabling the localization of clinical phenotypes and removal of unassociated gene regions. The windows can be built by sliding across either the nucleotide sequence of the gene (through 1D space) or the positions of the amino acids in the folded protein (through 3D space). Using a training set of 350k exomes from the UK Biobank (UKB), we developed PW models for well-established gene-disease associations and tested their accuracy in two independent cohorts (117k UKB exomes and 65k exomes sequenced at Helix in the Healthy Nevada Project, myGenetics, or In Our DNA SC studies). The significant models retained a median of 49% of the qualifying variant carriers in each gene (range 2%-98%), with quantitative traits showing a median effect size improvement of 66% compared with aggregating variants across the entire gene, and binary traits' odds ratios improving by a median of 2.2-fold. PW showcases that electronic health record-based statistical analyses can accurately distinguish between novel coding variants in established genes that will have high phenotypic penetrance and those that will not, unlocking new potential for human genomics research, drug development, variant interpretation, and precision medicine.","Cirulli, Elizabeth T; Schiabor Barrett, Kelly M; Bolze, Alexandre; Judge, Daniel P; Pawloski, Pamala A; Grzymski, Joseph J; Lee, William; Washington, Nicole L",HGG advances,2024,Humans; Genetic Variation; Protein Folding; Phenotype; Base Sequence; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Exome,genetic analysis; rare variants; sliding window,"Helix, 101 S Ellsworth Ave Suite 350, San Mateo, CA 94401, USA.

FinnGen,34594039,A cross-population atlas of genetic associations for 220 human phenotypes.,"Current genome-wide association studies do not yet capture sufficient diversity in populations and scope of phenotypes. To expand an atlas of genetic associations in non-European populations, we conducted 220 deep-phenotype genome-wide association studies (diseases, biomarkers and medication usage) in BioBank Japan (n = 179,000), by incorporating past medical history and text-mining of electronic medical records. Meta-analyses with the UK Biobank and FinnGen (n","Sakaue, Saori; Kanai, Masahiro; Tanigawa, Yosuke; Karjalainen, Juha; Kurki, Mitja; Koshiba, Seizo; Narita, Akira; Konuma, Takahiro; Yamamoto, Kenichi;

FinnGen,36777996,Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative: Powering genetic discovery across human disease.,"Biobanks facilitate genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which have mapped genomic loci across a range of human diseases and traits. However, most biobanks are primarily composed of individuals of European ancestry. We introduce the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI)-a collaborative network of 23 biobanks from 4 continents representing more than 2.2 million consented individuals with genetic data linked to electronic health records. GBMI meta-analyzes summary statistics from GWASs generated using harmonized genotypes and phenotypes from member biobanks for 14 exemplar diseases and endpoints. This strategy validates that GWASs conducted in diverse biobanks can be integrated despite heterogeneity in case definitions, recruitment strategies, and baseline characteristics. This collaborative effort improves GWAS power for diseases, benefits understudied diseases, and improves risk prediction while also enabling the nomination of disease genes and drug candidates by incorporating gene and protein expression data and providing insight into the underlying biology of human diseases and traits.","Zhou, Wei; Kanai, Masahiro; Wu, Kuan-Han H; Rasheed, Humaira; Tsuo, Kristin; Hirbo, Jibril B; Wang, Ying; Bhattacharya, Arjun; Zhao, Huiling; Namba, Shinichi; Surakka, Ida; Wolford, Brooke N; Lo Faro, Valeria; Lopera-Maya, Esteban A; Läll, Kristi; Favé, Marie-Julie; Partanen, Juulia J; Chapman, Sinéad B; Karjalainen, Juha; Kurki, Mitja; Maasha, Mutaamba; Brumpton, Ben M; Chavan, Sameer; Chen, Tzu-Ting; Daya, Michelle; Ding, Yi; Feng, Yen-Chen A; Guare, Lindsay A; Gignoux, Christopher R; Graham, Sarah E; Hornsby, Whitney E; Ingold, Nathan; Ismail, Said I; Johnson, Ruth; Laisk, Triin; Lin, Kuang; Lv, Jun; Millwood, Iona Y; Moreno-Grau, Sonia; Nam, Kisung; Palta, Priit; Pandit, Anita; Preuss, Michael H; Saad, Chadi; Setia-Verma, Shefali; Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Uzunovic, Jasmina; Verma, Anurag; Zawistowski, Matthew; Zhong, Xue; Afifi, Nahla; Al-Dabhani, Kawthar M; Al Thani, Asma; Bradford, Yuki; Campbell, Archie; Crooks, Kristy; de Bock, Geertruida H; Damrauer, Scott M; Douville, Nicholas J; Finer, Sarah; Fritsche, Lars G; Fthenou, Eleni; Gonzalez-Arroyo, Gilberto; Griffiths, Christopher J; Guo, Yu; Hunt, Karen A; Ioannidis, Alexander; Jansonius, Nomdo M; Konuma, Takahiro; Lee, Ming Ta Michael; Lopez-Pineda, Arturo; Matsuda, Yuta; Marioni, Riccardo E; Moatamed, Babak; Nava-Aguilar, Marco A; Numakura, Kensuke; Patil, Snehal; Rafaels, Nicholas; Richmond, Anne; Rojas-Muñoz, Agustin; Shortt, Jonathan A; Straub, Peter; Tao, Ran; Vanderwerff, Brett; Vernekar, Manvi; Veturi, Yogasudha; Barnes, Kathleen C; Boezen, Marike; Chen, Zhengming; Chen, Chia-Yen; Cho, Judy; Smith, George Davey; Finucane, Hilary K; Franke, Lude; Gamazon, Eric R; Ganna, Andrea; Gaunt, Tom R; Ge, Tian; Huang, Hailiang; Huffman, Jennifer; Katsanis, Nicholas; Koskela, Jukka T; Lajonchere, Clara; Law, Matthew H; Li, Liming; Lindgren, Cecilia M; Loos, Ruth J F; MacGregor, Stuart; Matsuda, Koichi; Olsen, Catherine M; Porteous, David J; Shavit, Jordan A; Snieder, Harold; Takano, Tomohiro; Trembath, Richard C; Vonk, Judith M; Whiteman, David C; Wicks, Stephen J; Wijmenga, Cisca; Wright, John; Zheng, Jie; Zhou, Xiang; Awadalla, Philip; Boehnke, Michael; Bustamante, Carlos D; Cox, Nancy J; Fatumo, Segun; Geschwind, Daniel H; Hayward, Caroline; Hveem, Kristian; Kenny, Eimear E; Lee, Seunggeun; Lin, Yen-Feng; Mbarek, Hamdi; Mägi, Reedik; Martin, Hilary C; Medland, Sarah E; Okada, Yukinori; Palotie, Aarno V; Pasaniuc, Bogdan; Rader, Daniel J; Ritchie, Marylyn D; Sanna, Serena; Smoller, Jordan W; Stefansson, Kari; van Heel, David A; Walters, Robin G; Zöllner, Sebastian; Martin, Alicia R; Willer, Cristen J; Daly, Mark J; Neale, Benjamin M",Cell genomics,2022,,GWAS; ancestry diversity; biobank; genetic association studies; meta-analysis; phenotype harmonization,"Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Statistical Genetics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.; Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; K.G.

FinnGen,38703417,Impact of loss-of-function in angiopoietin-like 4 on the human phenome.,"Carriers of the E40K loss-of-function variant in Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), have lower plasma triglyceride levels as well as lower rates of coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). These genetic data suggest ANGPTL4 inhibition as a potential therapeutic target for cardiometabolic diseases. However, it is unknown whether the association between E40K and human diseases is due to linkage disequilibrium confounding. The broader impact of genetic ANGPTL4 inhibition is also unknown, raising uncertainties about the safety and validity of this target. To assess the impact of ANGPLT4 inhibition, we evaluated whether E40K and other loss-of-function variants in ANGPTL4 influenced a wide range of health markers and diseases using 29 publicly available genome-wide association meta-analyses of cardiometabolic traits and diseases, as well as 1589 diseases assessed in electronic health records within FinnGen (n = 309,154). To determine whether these relationships were likely causal, and not driven by other correlated variants, we used the Bayesian fine mapping algorithm CoPheScan. The CoPheScan posterior probability of E40K being the causal variant for triglyceride levels was 99.99 %, validating the E40K to proxy lifelong lower activity of ANGPTL4. The E40K variant was associated with lower risk of CAD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.84, 95 % CI = 0.81 to 0.87, p=3.6e-21) and T2D (OR = 0.91, 95 % CI = 0.87 to 0.95, p=2.8e-05) in GWAS meta-analyses, with results replicated in FinnGen. These significant results were also replicated using other rare loss-of-function variants identified through whole exome sequencing in 488,278 participants of the UK Biobank. Using a Mendelian randomization study design, the E40K variant effect on cardiometabolic diseases was concordant with lipoprotein lipase enhancement (r = 0.82), but not hepatic lipase enhancement (r = -0.10), suggesting that ANGPTL4 effects on cardiometabolic diseases are potentially mainly mediated through lipoprotein lipase. After correction for multiple testing, the E40K variant did not significantly increase the risk of any of the 1589 diseases tested in FinnGen. ANGPTL4 inhibition may represent a potentially safe and effective target for cardiometabolic diseases prevention or treatment.","Gagnon, Eloi; Bourgault, Jérome; Gobeil, Émilie; Thériault, Sébastien; Arsenault, Benoit J",Atherosclerosis,2024,"Humans; Angiopoietin-Like Protein 4; Phenotype; Genome-Wide Association Study; Loss of Function Mutation; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Triglycerides; Coronary Artery Disease; Bayes Theorem; Risk Factors; Lipoprotein Lipase",,"Centre de Recherche de L'Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec, Québec, QC, Canada.; Centre de Recherche de L'Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec, Québec, QC, Canada.; Centre de Recherche de L'Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec, Québec, QC, Canada.; Centre de Recherche de L'Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec, Québec, QC, Canada; Department of Molecular Biology, Medical Biochemistry and Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, QC, Canada.; Centre de Recherche de L'Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Québec, Québec, QC, Canada; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, QC, Canada.

FinnGen,37697398,Use of electronic health record data mining for heart failure subtyping.,"To assess whether electronic health record (EHR) data text mining can be used to improve register-based heart failure (HF) subtyping. EHR data of 43,405 individuals from two Finnish hospital biobanks were mined for unstructured text mentions of ejection fraction (EF) and validated against clinical assessment in two sets of 100 randomly selected individuals. Structured laboratory data was then incorporated for a categorization by HF subtype (HF with mildly reduced EF, HFmrEF; HF with preserved EF, HFpEF; HF with reduced EF, HFrEF; and no HF). In 86% of the cases, the algorithm-identified EF belonged to the correct HF subtype range. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the algorithm were 94-100% for HFrEF, 85-100% for HFmrEF, and 96%, 67%, 53% and 98% for HFpEF. Survival analyses using the traditional diagnosis of HF were in concordance with the algorithm-based ones. Compared to healthy individuals, mortality increased from HFmrEF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-2.95) to HFpEF (2.28; 1.80-2.88) to HFrEF group (2.63; 1.97-3.50) over a follow-up of 1.5 years. We conclude that quantitative EF data can be efficiently extracted from EHRs and used with laboratory data to subtype HF with reasonable accuracy, especially for HFrEF.","Vuori, Matti A; Kiiskinen, Tuomo; Pitkänen, Niina; Kurki, Samu; Laivuori, Hannele; Laitinen, Tarja; Mäntylahti, Sampo; Palotie, Aarno; FinnGen; Niiranen, Teemu J",BMC research notes,2023,Humans; Heart Failure; Electronic Health Records; Stroke Volume; Algorithms; Data Mining,Data mining; Ejection fraction; Electronic health records; HFmrEF; HFpEF; HFrEF; Heart failure; Text mining,"Division of Medicine, University of Turku, Kiinamyllynkatu 10, Turku, FI-20520, Finland. makvuo@utu.fi.; Turku University Hospital, Kiinamyllynkatu 4-8, Box 52, Turku, FI-20521, Finland. makvuo@utu.fi.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Tukholmankatu 8, Helsinki, Finland. makvuo@utu.fi.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Tukholmankatu 8, Helsinki, Finland.; Auria Biobank, Kiinamyllynkatu 10, PO Box 30, Turku, FI-20520, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Tukholmankatu 8, Helsinki, Finland.; Auria Biobank, Kiinamyllynkatu 10, PO Box 30, Turku, FI-20520, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Tukholmankatu 8, Helsinki, Finland.; Centre for Child, Adolescent, and Maternal Health Research, Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.; Administration Center, Tampere University Hospital and University of Tampere, P.O.

FinnGen,39262212,High Burden of Ileus and Pneumonia in Clozapine-Treated Individuals With Schizophrenia: A Finnish 25-Year Follow-Up Register Study.,"The authors used longitudinal biobank data with up to 25 years of follow-up on over 2,600 clozapine users to derive reliable estimates of the real-world burden of clozapine adverse drug events (ADEs). A total of 2,659 participants in the FinnGen biobank project had a schizophrenia diagnosis and clozapine purchases with longitudinal electronic health record follow-up for up to 25 years after clozapine initiation. Diseases and health-related events enriched during clozapine use were identified, adjusting for disease severity. The incidence and recurrence of ADEs over years of clozapine use, their effect on clozapine discontinuation and deaths, and their pharmacogenetics were studied. Median follow-up time after clozapine initiation was 12.7 years. Across 2,157 diseases and health-related events, 27 were enriched during clozapine use, falling into five disease categories: gastrointestinal hypomotility, seizures, pneumonia, other acute respiratory tract infections, and tachycardia, along with a heterogeneous group including neutropenia and type 2 diabetes, among others. Cumulative incidence estimates for ileus (severe gastrointestinal hypomotility) and pneumonia were 5.3% and 29.5%, respectively, 20 years after clozapine initiation. Both events were significantly associated with increased mortality among clozapine users (ileus: odds ratio=4.5; pneumonia: odds ratio=2.8). Decreased genotype-predicted CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 activities were associated with higher pneumonia risk. Clozapine-induced ileus and pneumonia were notably more frequent than has previously been reported and were associated with increased mortality.

FinnGen,34643165,The validity of rheumatoid arthritis diagnoses in Finnish biobanks.,"The aim of this study was to determine the validity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnoses in patients participating in Finnish biobanks. We reviewed the electronic medical records of 500 Finnish biobank participants: 125 patients with at least one visit with a diagnosis of seropositive RA, 125 patients with at least one visit with a diagnosis of seronegative RA, and 250 age- and gender-matched controls. The patients were chosen from five different biobank hospitals in Finland. A rheumatologist reviewed the medical records to assess whether each patients' diagnosis was correct. The diagnosis was compared with the diagnostic codes in the Finnish Care Register for Health Care (CRHC) and special reimbursement data of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. The positive predictive value (PPV) of CRHC diagnosis of RA (for seropositive and seronegative RA combined) was 0.82. For patients with a special reimbursement for anti-rheumatic medications for RA, the PPV was 0.89. The PPV was higher in patients with more than one visit. For one, two, five, and 10 visits, the PPV was 0.82, 0.85, 0.89, and 0.90, respectively, and for patients who also had the special reimbursement, the PPV was 0.89, 0.91, 0.93, and 0.94 for one, two, five, and 10 visits, respectively. In patients positive for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, the PPV was 0.98. These results demonstrate that the validity of RA diagnoses in Finnish biobanks was good and can be further improved by including data on special reimbursement for medication, number of visits, and serological data.","Paltta, J; Heikkilä, H-K; Pirilä, L; Eklund, K K; Huhtakangas, J; Isomäki, P; Kaipiainen-Seppänen, O; Kristiansson, K; Havulinna, A S; Sokka-Isler, T; Palomäki, A",Scandinavian journal of rheumatology,2023,"Humans; Finland; Biological Specimen Banks; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Antirheumatic Agents; Predictive Value of Tests; Rheumatoid Factor",,"Centre for Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Division of Medicine, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Turku, Finland.; Centre for Rheumatic Diseases, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.; Centre for Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Division of Medicine, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Turku, Finland.; Department of Rheumatology, Helsinki University Hospital, University of Helsinki and Orton Orthopaedic Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Oulu University Hospital and Medical Research Center Oulu, Oulu, Finland.; Centre for Rheumatic Diseases, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.; Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.; Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.; Department of Public Health Solutions, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Public Health Solutions, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Helsinki, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, FIMM, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Medicine, Jyväskylä Central Hospital, Jyväskylä, Finland.; Centre for Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Division of Medicine, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Turku, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, FIMM, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; FinnGen members are listed in the Supplementary material.",10.1080/03009742.2021.1967047
FinnGen,36114182,Efficient and accurate frailty model approach for genome-wide survival association analysis in large-scale biobanks.,"With decades of electronic health records linked to genetic data, large biobanks provide unprecedented opportunities for systematically understanding the genetics of the natural history of complex diseases. Genome-wide survival association analysis can identify genetic variants associated with ages of onset, disease progression and lifespan. We propose an efficient and accurate frailty model approach for genome-wide survival association analysis of censored time-to-event (TTE) phenotypes by accounting for both population structure and relatedness. Our method utilizes state-of-the-art optimization strategies to reduce the computational cost. The saddlepoint approximation is used to allow for analysis of heavily censored phenotypes (>90%) and low frequency variants (down to minor allele count 20). We demonstrate the performance of our method through extensive simulation studies and analysis of five TTE phenotypes, including lifespan, with heavy censoring rates (90.9% to 99.8%) on ~400,000 UK Biobank participants with white British ancestry and ~180,000 individuals in FinnGen. We further analyzed 871 TTE phenotypes in the UK Biobank and presented the genome-wide scale phenome-wide association results with the PheWeb browser.","Dey, Rounak; Zhou, Wei; Kiiskinen, Tuomo; Havulinna, Aki; Elliott, Amanda; Karjalainen, Juha; Kurki, Mitja; Qin, Ashley; Lee, Seunggeun; Palotie, Aarno; Neale, Benjamin; Daly, Mark; Lin, Xihong",Nature communications,2022,Biological Specimen Banks; Frailty; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Phenomics; Phenotype,,"Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

FinnGen,39809352,Evidence for a causal link between lipoprotein (a) and mental disorders: A retrospective and Mendelian randomization study.,"Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is a biomarker of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but its role in mental disorders is controversial. Our study aimed to explore the causality between Lp(a) levels and mental disorders by combining retrospective and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. All genome-wide association study datasets used in the MR study were obtained from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. The matched case-control study were based on electronic health records from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University and NHANES III cohort. In the MR analysis, Lp(a) had a positive causal effect on the longest period of depression [1.05 (1.02-1.08), P = 0.0001], the number of depressive episodes [1.03 (1.01-1.06), P = 0.009] and a weak negative effect on memory loss [0.84 (0.72-0.99), P = 0.039]. Meanwhile, bipolar and major depressive disorder status was causally associated with significantly lower Lp(a) levels [0.96 (0.93-0.98), P = 0.003]. Retrospective study revealed low Lp(a) levels were associated with a significantly higher risk of depression (n = 670) [1.273 (1.007, 1.609), P = 0.044], anxiety (n = 1284) [1.231 (1.041, 1.456), P = 0.015] and major depression (n = 538) [1.364 (1.012,1.841), P = 0.042]. This study found there is a causal relationship between the number and longest period of depressive episodes or memory loss and Lp(a), while bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder were associated with a significant causal effect on reduced Lp(a) levels. Future studies should focus on whether a sustained decrease in Lp(a) levels could cause the development of mental disorders, and which target value is suitable for clinical practice.","Pan, Guanrui; Fu, Qingan; Xu, Yuan; Jiang, Long",Journal of affective disorders,2025,"Humans; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Lipoprotein(a); Retrospective Studies; Genome-Wide Association Study; Male; Female; Depressive Disorder, Major; Middle Aged; Case-Control Studies; Mental Disorders; Bipolar Disorder; Adult; Biomarkers",Lipoprotein (a); Mendelian randomization study; Mental disorders; Retrospective study,"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China.; Department of Medical Big Data Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China.

FinnGen,34098570,Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Genetic Risk Factors for Spastic Cerebral Palsy.,"Although many clinical risk factors of spastic cerebral palsy (CP) have been identified, the genetic basis of spastic CP is largely unknown. Here, using whole-genome genetic information linked to a deidentified electronic health record (BioVU) with replication in the UK Biobank and FinnGen, we perform the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for spastic CP. To define the genetic basis of spastic CP. Whole-genome data were obtained using the multi-ethnic genotyping array (MEGA) genotyping array capturing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.01, and imputation quality score (r2) > 0.3, imputed based on the 1000 genomes phase 3 reference panel. Threshold for genome-wide significance was defined after Bonferroni correction for the total number of SNPs tested (P < 5.0 × 10-8). Replication analysis (defined as P < .05) was performed in the UK Biobank and FinnGen. We identify 1 SNP (rs78686911) reaching genome-wide significance with spastic CP. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis suggests that rs78686911 decreases expression of GRIK4, a gene that encodes a high-affinity kainate glutamatergic receptor of largely unknown function.

FinnGen,37577704,Integrating Genome-wide information and Wearable Device Data to Explore the Link of Anxiety and Antidepressants with Heart Rate Variability.,"Anxiety disorders are associated with decreased heart rate variability (HRV), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We selected individuals with whole-genome sequencing, Fitbit, and electronic health record data (N=920; 61,333 data points) from the All of Us Research Program. Anxiety PRS were derived with PRS-CS after meta-analyzing anxiety genome-wide association studies from three major cohorts-UK Biobank, FinnGen, and the Million Veterans Program (N Total =364,550). The standard deviation of average RR intervals (SDANN) was calculated using five-minute average RR intervals over full 24-hour heart rate measurements. Antidepressant exposure was defined as an active antidepressant prescription at the time of the HRV measurement in the EHR. The associations of daily SDANN measurements with the anxiety PRS, antidepressant classes, and antidepressant substances were tested. Participants with lifetime diagnoses of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus, and major depression were excluded in sensitivity analyses. One-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to assess potential causal effect of anxiety on SDANN. Anxiety PRS was independently associated with reduced SDANN (beta=-0.08; p=0.003). Of the eight antidepressant medications and four classes tested, venlafaxine (beta=-0.12, p=0.002) and bupropion (beta=-0.071, p=0.01), tricyclic antidepressants (beta=-0.177, p=0.0008), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.069; p=0.0008) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.16; p=2×10  Anxiety and antidepressants are independently associated with decreased HRV, and anxiety appears to exert a causal effect on HRV.

Because the number of diagnosed GD patients in Finland is relatively low, and the true prevalence is currently not known, it was hypothesized that undiagnosed GD patients may exist in Finland. Our previous study demonstrated the applicability of Gaucher Earlier Diagnosis Consensus point-scoring system (GED-C PSS; Mehta et al., 2019) and Finnish biobank data and specimens in the automated point scoring of large populations. An indicative point-score range for Finnish GD patients was determined, but undiagnosed patients were not identified partly due to high number of high-score subjects in combination with a lack of suitable samples for diagnostics in the assessed biobank population. The current study extended the screening to another biobank and evaluated the feasibility of utilising the automated GED-C PSS in conjunction with small nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip genotype data from the FinnGen study of biobank sample donors in the identification of undiagnosed GD patients in Finland. Furthermore, the applicability of FFPE tissues and DNA restoration in the next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the  Previously diagnosed Finnish GD patients eligible to the study, and up to 45,100 sample donors in Helsinki Biobank (HBB) were point scored. The GED-C point scoring, adjusted to local data, was automated, but also partly manually verified for GD patients. The SNP chip genotype data for rare  Three previously diagnosed GD patients and one patient previously treated for GD-related features were included. A genetic diagnosis was confirmed for the patient treated for GD-related features. The GED-C point score of the GD patients was 12.5-22.5 in the current study. The score in eight Finnish GD patients of the previous and the current study is thus 6-22.5 points per patient. In the automated point scoring of the HBB subpopulation (N ≈ 45,100), the overall scores ranged from 0 to 17.5, with 0.77% (346/45,100) of the subjects having ≥10 points. The analysis of SNP chip genotype data was able to identify the diagnosed GD patients, but potential undiagnosed patients with the GED-C score and/or the  These findings imply that the prevalence of diagnosed patients (~1:325,000) may indeed correspond the true prevalence of GD in Finland. The SNP chip genotype data is a valuable tool that complements the screening with the GED-C PSS, especially if the genotyping pipeline is tuned for rare variants. These proof-of-concept biobank tools can be adapted to other rare genetic diseases.","Pehrsson, Minja; Heikkinen, Hanna; Wartiovaara-Kautto, Ulla; Mäntylahti, Sampo; Bäckström, Pia; Lassenius, Mariann I; Uusi-Rauva, Kristiina; Carpén, Olli; Elomaa, Kaisa",Molecular genetics and metabolism reports,2022,,"BB, Biobank Borealis of Northern Finland; Biobank study; DF4/DF5, Data freeze 4/5; EHR, Electronic health record; Electronic health record data; FFPE, Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded; GBA; GBA1/GBA, β-glucocerebrosidase gene; GD, Gaucher disease; GED-C, Gaucher Earlier Diagnosis Consensus; Gaucher disease; Gaucher earlier diagnosis consensus point-scoring system; GlcCer, β-glucosylceramide; GlcCerase, β-glucosylceramidase; GlcSph/Lyso-Gb1, β-glucosylsphingosine; HBB, Helsinki Biobank; HUH, Helsinki University Hospital; HUS, Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa; ICD-10, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision; NGS, Next-generation sequencing; OUH, Oulu University Hospital; PSS, Point-scoring system; SNP, small nucleotide polymorphism; Small nucleotide polymorphism chip genotype data; VUS, variant of uncertain significance","Helsinki Biobank, Helsinki University Hospital, Haartmaninkatu 3, 00290 Helsinki, Finland.; Helsinki Biobank, Helsinki University Hospital, Haartmaninkatu 3, 00290 Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki University Hospital and University of Helsinki, Haartmaninkatu 4, 00290 Helsinki, Finland.; Helsinki Biobank, Helsinki University Hospital, Haartmaninkatu 3, 00290 Helsinki, Finland.; Helsinki Biobank, Helsinki University Hospital, Haartmaninkatu 3, 00290 Helsinki, Finland.; Medaffcon Oy, Metsänneidonkuja 8, 02130 Espoo, Finland.; Medaffcon Oy, Metsänneidonkuja 8, 02130 Espoo, Finland.; Helsinki Biobank, Helsinki University Hospital, Haartmaninkatu 3, 00290 Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki, HUS Diagnostic Center, Finland.; Takeda Oy, Ilmalantori 1, 00101 Helsinki, Finland.",10.1016/j.ymgmr.2022.100911

Cohort study including observational, genetic, and Mendelian randomisation analyses. 22 centres across England, Scotland, and Wales in UK Biobank (2006-10), with replication in a national Finnish cohort (FinnGen). 463 060 participants in the UK Biobank were successfully genotyped for a genetic variant (rs887829) that is strongly associated with Gilbert syndrome and 438 056 participants had measured bilirubin concentrations with linked electronic health record data coded using the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Replication analyses were performed in FinnGen (n=429 209) with linked electronic health record data. Odds ratios for the association between serum bilirubin concentrations, rs887829-T homozygosity (the risk genotype for Gilbert syndrome), genetically predicted bilirubin using rs887829-T allele carriage alone, and a wide range of health outcomes recorded in primary and secondary care. 46 189 participants in UK Biobank (about 10%) were homozygous for rs887829-T defining them as having the genotype characterising Gilbert syndrome. However, only 1701 (3%) of this group had a coded diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome. Variation at this locus explained 37.1% of all variation in measured serum bilirubin. In the observational analyses, higher bilirubin concentrations had strong inverse associations with a wide range of outcomes including overall health status, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction, and cholesterol measures. These associations were not identified in people with the Gilbert genotype. We identified associations with genetically predicted bilirubin concentrations and biliary and liver pathology (eg, odds ratio for cholelithiasis 1.16 (95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.20); P=5.7×10 Only 3% of participants who are homozygous for rs887829-T have a recorded diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome. Carriers of this genotype have modest increases in the odds of developing biliary pathology and pityriasis rosea. Evidence from the analyses of genetic data suggests that bilirubin has no likely causal role in protection from cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other key healthcare outcomes and therefore represents a poor target for therapeutic intervention for these outcomes.","Hamilton, Fergus W; Abeysekera, Kwm; Hamilton, Willie; Timpson, Nicholas J",BMJ medicine,2023,,gastrointestinal diseases; genetics; medicine,"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Bristol, UK.; Infection Science, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Bristol, UK.; Department of Liver Medicine, Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol, UK.; Medical School, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Bristol, UK.",10.1136/bmjmed-2022-000467

We introduce GRASP, a novel transformer-based architecture that enhances the generalizability of EHR-based prediction by embedding medical codes into a unified semantic space using a large language model. We applied GRASP to predict the onset of 21 diseases and all-cause mortality in over one million individuals from UK Biobank (UK), FinnGen (Finland) and Mount Sinai (USA), all harmonized to OMOP common data model. Trained on the UK Biobank and evaluated in FinnGen and Mount Sinai, GRASP achieved an average ΔC-index that was 83% and 35% higher than language-unaware models, respectively. GRASP also showed significantly higher correlations with polygenic risk scores for 62% of diseases. Notably, GRASP mantained robust performance even when datasets were not harmonized to the same data model, accurately predicting disease risk from ICD-10-CM codes without direct mappings to OMOP. GRASP enables accurate and transferable disease predictions across heterogeneous healthcare systems with minimal resource requirements.","Kirchler, Matthias; Ferro, Matteo; Lorenzini, Veronica; Lippert, Christoph; Ganna, Andrea",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025,,,"Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam, Digital Engineering Faculty, Potsdam, Germany.; Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY, US.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam, Digital Engineering Faculty, Potsdam, Germany.; Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY, US.; Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.",10.1101/2025.02.03.25321597

We performed a GWAS of OSA in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system, where OSA prevalence is close to its true population prevalence. We performed GWAS of 568,576 MVP participants, stratified by biological sex and by harmonized race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry (HARE) groups of White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian individuals. We considered both BMI adjusted (BMI-adj) and unadjusted (BMI-unadj) models. We replicated associations in independent datasets, and analysed the heterogeneity of OSA genetic associations across HARE and sex groups. We finally performed a larger meta-analysis GWAS of MVP, FinnGen, and the MGB Biobank, totalling 916,696 individuals. MVP participants are 91% male. OSA prevalence is 21%. In MVP there were 18 and 6 genome-wide significant loci in BMI-unadj and BMI-adj analyses, respectively, corresponding to 21 association regions. Of these, 17 were not previously reported in association with OSA, and 13 replicated in FinnGen (False Discovery Rate p-value < 0.05). There were widespread significant differences in genetic effects between men and women, but less so across HARE groups. Meta-analysis of MVP, FinnGen, and MGB biobank revealed 17 additional, previously unreported, genome-wide significant regions. Sex differences in genetic associations with OSA are widespread, likely associated with multiple OSA risk factors. OSA shares genetic underpinnings with several sleep phenotypes, suggesting shared aetiology and causal pathways.

Yet, our understanding of the prevalence and associated health outcomes is largely driven by observational studies of clinically diagnosed cases, resulting in a disproportionate focus on 47,XXY and associated hypogonadism. We analyzed microarray intensity data of sex chromosomes for 1.5 million individuals enrolled in three large cohorts-Million Veteran Program, FinnGen, and UK Biobank-to identify individuals with 47,XXY, 47,XYY, and 47,XXX. We examined disease conditions associated with SCTs by performing phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) using electronic health records (EHR) data for each cohort, followed by meta-analysis across cohorts. Association results are presented for each SCT and also stratified by presence or absence of a documented clinical diagnosis for 47,XXY. We identified 2,769 individuals with (47,XXY: 1,319; 47,XYY: 1,108; 47,XXX: 342), most of whom had no documented clinical diagnosis (47,XXY: 73.8%; 47,XYY: 98.6%; 47,XXX: 93.6%). The identified phenotypic associations with SCT spanned all PheWAS disease categories except neoplasms. Many associations are shared among three SCT subtypes, particularly for vascular diseases (e.g., chronic venous insufficiency (OR [95% CI] for 47,XXY 4.7 [3.9,5.8]; 47,XYY 5.6 [4.5,7.0]; 4 7,XXX 4.6 [2.7,7.6], venous thromboembolism (47,XXY 4.6 [3.7-5.6]; 47,XYY 4.1 [3.3-5.0]; 47,XXX 8.1 [4.2-15.4]), and glaucoma (47,XXY 2.5 [2.1-2.9]; 47,XYY 2.4 [2.0-2.8]; 47,XXX 2.3 [1.4-3.5]). A third sex chromosome confers an increased risk for systemic comorbidities, even if the SCT is not documented. SCT phenotypes largely overlap, suggesting one or more X/Y homolog genes may underlie pathophysiology and comorbidities across SCTs.","Davis, Shanlee M; Liu, Aoxing; Teerlink, Craig C; Lapato, Dana M;

FinnGen,35194621,"The public health impact of poor sleep on severe COVID-19, influenza and upper respiratory infections.","Poor sleep is associated with an increased risk of infections and all-cause mortality, and acute sleep loss and disruption have been linked with inflammation and poorer immune control. Previous studies, however, have been unable to evidence causality between the chronic effects of poor sleep and respiratory infection risk. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and potential future disease outbreaks, understanding the risk factors for these infections is of great importance. Our goal was to understand if chronic poor sleep could be identified as a causal risk factor for respiratory infections including influenza, upper respiratory infections and COVID-19. We used population cohorts from the UK Biobank (N ≈ 231,000) and FinnGen (N ≈ 327,000) with ICD-10 based electronic health records and obtained diagnoses of insomnia, influenza and upper respiratory infections (URIs) from primary care and hospital settings. We computed logistic regression to assess association between poor sleep and infections, disease free survival hazard ratios, and used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of insomnia, influenza, URI and COVID-19 to perform Mendelian randomization analyses and assess causality. Utilizing 23 years of registry data and follow-up, we saw that insomnia diagnosis associated with increased risk for infections in FinnGen and in UK Biobank (FinnGen influenza HR = 5.32 [4.09, 6.92], P = 1.02×10 Our findings indicate that chronic poor sleep is a causal risk factor for contracting respiratory infections, and in addition contributes to the severity of respiratory infections. These findings highlight the role of sleep in maintaining sufficient immune response against pathogens as suggested by earlier work. As the current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the number of people suffering from poor sleep, safe interventions such as sleep management and treating individuals with insomnia could be promoted to reduce infections and save lives.","Jones, Samuel E; Maisha, Fahrisa I; Strausz, Satu J; Cade, Brian E; Tervi, Anniina M; Helaakoski, Viola; Broberg, Martin E; Lammi, Vilma; Lane, Jacqueline M; Redline, Susan; Saxena, Richa; Ollila, Hanna M",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2022,,,"Institute for Molecular Medicine, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Immunology and Dermatology, Yale University, School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.; Institute for Molecular Medicine, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Finland.; Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Institute for Molecular Medicine, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Finland.; Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Harvard T.H.

FinnGen,36540997,Predictive models for abdominal aortic aneurysms using polygenic scores and PheWAS-derived risk factors.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are common enlargements of the abdominal aorta which can grow larger until rupture, often leading to death. Detection of AAA is often by ultrasonography and screening recommendations are mostly directed at men over 65 with a smoking history. Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified genetic loci associated with AAA risk. We combined known risk factors, polygenic risk scores (PRS) and precedent clinical diagnoses from electronic health records (EHR) to develop predictive models for AAA, and compared performance against screening recommendations. The PRS included genome-wide summary statistics from the Million Veteran Program and FinnGen (10,467 cases, 378,713 controls of European ancestry), with optimization in Vanderbilt's BioVU and validated in the eMERGE Network, separately across both White and Black participants. Candidate diagnoses were identified through a temporally-oriented Phenome-wide association study in independent EHR data from Vanderbilt, and features were selected via elastic net. We calculated C-statistics in eMERGE for models including PRS, phecodes, and covariates using regression weights from BioVU. The AUC for the full model in the test set was 0.883 (95% CI 0.873-0.892), 0.844 (0.836-0.851) for covariates only, 0.613 (95% CI 0.604-0.622) when using primary USPSTF screening criteria, and 0.632 (95% CI 0.623-0.642) using primary and secondary criteria. Brier scores were between 0.003 and 0.023 for our models indicating good calibration, and net reclassification improvement over combined primary and secondary USPSTF criteria was 0.36-0.60. We provide PRS for AAA which are strongly associated with AAA risk and add to predictive model performance. These models substantially improve identification of people at risk of a AAA diagnosis compared with existing guidelines, with evidence of potential applicability in minority populations.","Hellwege, Jacklyn N; Dorn, Chad; Irvin, Marguerite R; Limdi, Nita A; Cimino, James; Beasley, T Mark; Tsao, Philip S; Damrauer, Scott M; Roden, Dan M; Velez Edwards, Digna R; Wei, Wei-Qi; Edwards, Todd L",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

FinnGen,38436303,Connecting cohorts of Finnish biobanks creates a research resource for the study of healthy ageing.,"Connecting cohorts with biobanks is a Finnish biobank collaboration, creating an infrastructure for the study of healthy ageing. We aimed to develop a model for data integration and harmonisation between different biobanks with procedures for joint access. The heart of the collaboration is the integrated datasets formed by using data from three biobanks: (a) Arctic Biobank, hosting regional birth cohorts and cohorts of elderly; (b) hospital-affiliated Borealis Biobank of Northern Finland; and (c) THL Biobank, hosting population-based cohorts. The datasets were created by developing a data dictionary, harmonising cohort data and with a joint pseudonymisation process. The connecting cohorts with biobanks resource at its widest consists altogether of almost 1.4 million individuals from collaborating biobanks. Utilising data from 107,000 cohort participants, we created harmonised datasets that contain attributes describing metabolic risk and frailty for studies of healthy ageing. These data can be complemented with medical data available from Biobank Borealis and with samples taken at hospital settings for approximately 38,000 cohort participants. In addition, the harmonised connecting cohorts with biobanks datasets can be expanded with supplementary data and samples from the collaborating biobanks.","Eklund, Niina; Pätsi, Salla-Maaria; Lehtiniemi, Heli; Rohkimainen, Samppa; Kivelä, Juha; Öhman, Hanna; Sauramo, Minttu; Sutinen, Kyösti; Keskinarkaus, Anja; Terho, Perttu; Seppänen, Tapio; Nyberg, Pia; Männikkö, Minna; Silander, Kaisa",Scandinavian journal of public health,2024,,Biobank; cohort; data harmonisation; electronic health records; genomics; healthy ageing; research resource,"THL Biobank, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.; THL Biobank, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.; Arctic Biobank, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.; Borealis Biobank of Northern Finland, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.; Borealis Biobank of Northern Finland, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.; Borealis Biobank of Northern Finland, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.; THL Biobank, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.; THL Biobank, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.; Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis (CMVS), University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.; Auria Biobank, Turku, Finland.; Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis (CMVS), University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.; Borealis Biobank of Northern Finland, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.; Research Unit of Translational Medicine, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.; Arctic Biobank, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.; THL Biobank, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.",10.1177/14034948241228482
FinnGen,39670376,Constructing a multi-ancestry polygenic risk score for uterine fibroids using publicly available data highlights need for inclusive genetic research.,"Uterine leiomyomata, or fibroids, are common gynecological tumors causing pelvic and menstrual symptoms that can negatively affect quality of life and child-bearing desires. As fibroids grow, symptoms can intensify and lead to invasive treatments that are less likely to preserve fertility. Identifying individuals at highest risk for fibroids can aid in access to earlier diagnoses. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) quantify genetic risk to identify those at highest risk for disease. Utilizing the PRS software PRS-CSx and publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from FinnGen and Biobank Japan, we constructed a multi-ancestry (META) PRS for fibroids. We validated the META PRS in two cross-ancestry cohorts. In the cross-ancestry Electronic Medical Record and Genomics (eMERGE) Network cohort, the META PRS was significantly associated with fibroid status and exhibited 1.11 greater odds for fibroids per standard deviation increase in PRS (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05 - 1.17, p = 5.21x10-5). The META PRS was validated in two BioVU cohorts: one using ICD9/ICD10 codes and one requiring imaging confirmation of fibroid status. In the ICD cohort, a standard deviation increase in the META PRS increased the odds of fibroids by 1.23 (95% CI: 1.15 - 1.32, p = 9.68x10-9), while in the imaging cohort, the odds increased by 1.26 (95% CI: 1.18 - 1.35, p = 2.40x10-11). We subsequently constructed single ancestry PRS for FinnGen (European ancestry [EUR]) and Biobank Japan (East Asian ancestry [EAS]) using PRS-CS and discovered a nominally significant association in the eMERGE cohort within fibroids and EAS PRS but not EUR PRS (95% CI: 1.09 - 1.20, p = 1.64x10-7). These findings highlight the strong predictive power of multi-ancestry PRS over single ancestry PRS. This study underscores the necessity of diverse population inclusion in genetic research to ensure precision medicine benefits all individuals equitably.","Winters, Jessica L G; Piekos, Jacqueline A; Hellwege, Jacklyn N; Dikilitas, Ozan; Kullo, Iftikhar J; Schaid, Daniel J; Edwards, Todd L; Velez Edwards, Digna R",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

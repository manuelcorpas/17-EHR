Estonian Biobank,36777996,Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative: Powering genetic discovery across human disease.,"Biobanks facilitate genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which have mapped genomic loci across a range of human diseases and traits. However, most biobanks are primarily composed of individuals of European ancestry. We introduce the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI)-a collaborative network of 23 biobanks from 4 continents representing more than 2.2 million consented individuals with genetic data linked to electronic health records. GBMI meta-analyzes summary statistics from GWASs generated using harmonized genotypes and phenotypes from member biobanks for 14 exemplar diseases and endpoints. This strategy validates that GWASs conducted in diverse biobanks can be integrated despite heterogeneity in case definitions, recruitment strategies, and baseline characteristics. This collaborative effort improves GWAS power for diseases, benefits understudied diseases, and improves risk prediction while also enabling the nomination of disease genes and drug candidates by incorporating gene and protein expression data and providing insight into the underlying biology of human diseases and traits.","Zhou, Wei; Kanai, Masahiro; Wu, Kuan-Han H; Rasheed, Humaira; Tsuo, Kristin; Hirbo, Jibril B; Wang, Ying; Bhattacharya, Arjun; Zhao, Huiling; Namba, Shinichi; Surakka, Ida; Wolford, Brooke N; Lo Faro, Valeria; Lopera-Maya, Esteban A; Läll, Kristi; Favé, Marie-Julie; Partanen, Juulia J; Chapman, Sinéad B; Karjalainen, Juha; Kurki, Mitja; Maasha, Mutaamba; Brumpton, Ben M; Chavan, Sameer; Chen, Tzu-Ting; Daya, Michelle; Ding, Yi; Feng, Yen-Chen A; Guare, Lindsay A; Gignoux, Christopher R; Graham, Sarah E; Hornsby, Whitney E; Ingold, Nathan; Ismail, Said I; Johnson, Ruth; Laisk, Triin; Lin, Kuang; Lv, Jun; Millwood, Iona Y; Moreno-Grau, Sonia; Nam, Kisung; Palta, Priit; Pandit, Anita; Preuss, Michael H; Saad, Chadi; Setia-Verma, Shefali; Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Uzunovic, Jasmina; Verma, Anurag; Zawistowski, Matthew; Zhong, Xue; Afifi, Nahla; Al-Dabhani, Kawthar M; Al Thani, Asma; Bradford, Yuki; Campbell, Archie; Crooks, Kristy; de Bock, Geertruida H; Damrauer, Scott M; Douville, Nicholas J; Finer, Sarah; Fritsche, Lars G; Fthenou, Eleni; Gonzalez-Arroyo, Gilberto; Griffiths, Christopher J; Guo, Yu; Hunt, Karen A; Ioannidis, Alexander; Jansonius, Nomdo M; Konuma, Takahiro; Lee, Ming Ta Michael; Lopez-Pineda, Arturo; Matsuda, Yuta; Marioni, Riccardo E; Moatamed, Babak; Nava-Aguilar, Marco A; Numakura, Kensuke; Patil, Snehal; Rafaels, Nicholas; Richmond, Anne; Rojas-Muñoz, Agustin; Shortt, Jonathan A; Straub, Peter; Tao, Ran; Vanderwerff, Brett; Vernekar, Manvi; Veturi, Yogasudha; Barnes, Kathleen C; Boezen, Marike; Chen, Zhengming; Chen, Chia-Yen; Cho, Judy; Smith, George Davey; Finucane, Hilary K; Franke, Lude; Gamazon, Eric R; Ganna, Andrea; Gaunt, Tom R; Ge, Tian; Huang, Hailiang; Huffman, Jennifer; Katsanis, Nicholas; Koskela, Jukka T; Lajonchere, Clara; Law, Matthew H; Li, Liming; Lindgren, Cecilia M; Loos, Ruth J F; MacGregor, Stuart; Matsuda, Koichi; Olsen, Catherine M; Porteous, David J; Shavit, Jordan A; Snieder, Harold; Takano, Tomohiro; Trembath, Richard C; Vonk, Judith M; Whiteman, David C; Wicks, Stephen J; Wijmenga, Cisca; Wright, John; Zheng, Jie; Zhou, Xiang; Awadalla, Philip; Boehnke, Michael; Bustamante, Carlos D; Cox, Nancy J; Fatumo, Segun; Geschwind, Daniel H; Hayward, Caroline; Hveem, Kristian; Kenny, Eimear E; Lee, Seunggeun; Lin, Yen-Feng; Mbarek, Hamdi; Mägi, Reedik; Martin, Hilary C; Medland, Sarah E; Okada, Yukinori; Palotie, Aarno V; Pasaniuc, Bogdan; Rader, Daniel J; Ritchie, Marylyn D; Sanna, Serena; Smoller, Jordan W; Stefansson, Kari; van Heel, David A; Walters, Robin G; Zöllner, Sebastian; Martin, Alicia R; Willer, Cristen J; Daly, Mark J; Neale, Benjamin M",Cell genomics,2022,,GWAS; ancestry diversity; biobank; genetic association studies; meta-analysis; phenotype harmonization,"Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.; Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Statistical Genetics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita 565-0871, Japan.; Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.; K.G.

Estonian Biobank,37872160,"Genome-wide association study of thyroid-stimulating hormone highlights new genes, pathways and associations with thyroid disease.","Thyroid hormones play a critical role in regulation of multiple physiological functions and thyroid dysfunction is associated with substantial morbidity. Here, we use electronic health records to undertake a genome-wide association study of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, with a total sample size of 247,107. We identify 158 novel genetic associations, more than doubling the number of known associations with TSH, and implicate 112 putative causal genes, of which 76 are not previously implicated. A polygenic score for TSH is associated with TSH levels in African, South Asian, East Asian, Middle Eastern and admixed American ancestries, and associated with hypothyroidism and other thyroid disease in South Asians. In Europeans, the TSH polygenic score is associated with thyroid disease, including thyroid cancer and age-of-onset of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. We develop pathway-specific genetic risk scores for TSH levels and use these in phenome-wide association studies to identify potential consequences of pathway perturbation. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential utility of genetic associations to inform future therapeutics and risk prediction for thyroid diseases.","Williams, Alexander T; Chen, Jing; Coley, Kayesha; Batini, Chiara; Izquierdo, Abril; Packer, Richard; Abner, Erik; Kanoni, Stavroula; Shepherd, David J; Free, Robert C; Hollox, Edward J; Brunskill, Nigel J; Ntalla, Ioanna; Reeve, Nicola; Brightling, Christopher E; Venn, Laura; Adams, Emma; Bee, Catherine; Wallace, Susan E; Pareek, Manish; Hansell, Anna L; Esko, Tõnu; Stow, Daniel; Jacobs, Benjamin M; van Heel, David A; Hennah, William; Rao, Balasubramanya S; Dudbridge, Frank; Wain, Louise V; Shrine, Nick; Tobin, Martin D; John, Catherine",Nature communications,2023,Humans; Thyrotropin; Genome-Wide Association Study; Thyroid Diseases; Hypothyroidism; Hyperthyroidism; Thyroxine,,"Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK. atw20@leicester.ac.uk.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Infirmary Square, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Infirmary Square, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Infirmary Square, Leicester, UK.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Infirmary Square, Leicester, UK.; School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Genetics and Genome Biology, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Division of Population Medicine, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Infirmary Square, Leicester, UK.; Institute for Lung Health, Leicester NIHR BRC, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Infirmary Square, Leicester, UK.; Department of Respiratory Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Wolfson Institute of Population Health, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.; Preventive Neurology Unit, Wolfson Institute of Population Health, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.; Department of Neurology, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK.; Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.; Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland.; Neuroscience Center, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Institute for Molecular Medicine FIMM, HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Orion Pharma, Nottingham, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Infirmary Square, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Infirmary Square, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK. cj153@leicester.ac.uk.; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Infirmary Square, Leicester, UK. cj153@leicester.ac.uk.",10.1038/s41467-023-42284-5
Estonian Biobank,38987242,Characterising the genetic architecture of changes in adiposity during adulthood using electronic health records.,"Obesity is a heritable disease, characterised by excess adiposity that is measured by body mass index (BMI). While over 1,000 genetic loci are associated with BMI, less is known about the genetic contribution to adiposity trajectories over adulthood. We derive adiposity-change phenotypes from 24.5 million primary-care health records in over 740,000 individuals in the UK Biobank, Million Veteran Program USA, and Estonian Biobank, to discover and validate the genetic architecture of adiposity trajectories. Using multiple BMI measurements over time increases power to identify genetic factors affecting baseline BMI by 14%. In the largest reported genome-wide study of adiposity-change in adulthood, we identify novel associations with BMI-change at six independent loci, including rs429358 (APOE missense variant). The SNP-based heritability of BMI-change (1.98%) is 9-fold lower than that of BMI. The modest genetic correlation between BMI-change and BMI (45.2%) indicates that genetic studies of longitudinal trajectories could uncover novel biology of quantitative traits in adulthood.","Venkatesh, Samvida S; Ganjgahi, Habib; Palmer, Duncan S; Coley, Kayesha; Linchangco, Gregorio V; Hui, Qin; Wilson, Peter; Ho, Yuk-Lam; Cho, Kelly; Arumäe, Kadri; Wittemans, Laura B L; Nellåker, Christoffer; Vainik, Uku; Sun, Yan V; Holmes, Chris; Lindgren, Cecilia M; Nicholson, George",Nature communications,2024,"Humans; Adiposity; Body Mass Index; Electronic Health Records; Male; Genome-Wide Association Study; Female; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Obesity; Middle Aged; Adult; Aged; United Kingdom; Phenotype; Estonia; United States; Genetic Predisposition to Disease",,"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. samvida@well.ox.ac.uk.; Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. samvida@well.ox.ac.uk.; Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Nuffield Department of Population Health, Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Epidemiology, Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Atlanta VA Health Care System, Decatur, GA, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Atlanta VA Health Care System, Decatur, GA, USA.; Atlanta VA Health Care System, Decatur, GA, USA.; Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.; Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Aging, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Institute of Psychology, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Novo Nordisk Research Centre Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Nuffield Department of Women's and Reproductive Health, Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Nuffield Department of Women's and Reproductive Health, Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Institute of Psychology, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of McGill, Montreal, Canada.; Department of Epidemiology, Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA, USA.; Atlanta VA Health Care System, Decatur, GA, USA.; Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Nuffield Department of Medicine, Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; The Alan Turing Institute, London, UK.; Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. cecilia.lindgren@bdi.ox.ac.uk.; Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. cecilia.lindgren@bdi.ox.ac.uk.; Nuffield Department of Women's and Reproductive Health, Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. cecilia.lindgren@bdi.ox.ac.uk.; Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA. cecilia.lindgren@bdi.ox.ac.uk.; Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. george.nicholson@stats.ox.ac.uk.",10.1038/s41467-024-49998-0

Participants were recruited through a network of medical professionals throughout Estonia (population 1.34 million). Unique legislation as well as a broad consent form give the Estonian Genome Center, a research institute of the University of Tartu, permission to re-contact participants and to retrieve participants' data from national registries and databases. In addition to two re-contacting projects to update the health data of participants, extensive clinical characterizations have been retrieved from national registries and hospital databases regularly since 2010. Acquiring data from electronic health records and registries has provided a means to update and enhance the database of the Genome Center in a timely manner and at low cost. The resulting database allows a wide spectrum of genomic and epidemiological research to be conducted with the aim of benefitting public health. Future plans include linking the genome center database with the national health information system through X-road and exchanging data in real time, as well as using the genetic data and the technical infrastructure available for piloting personalized medicine in Estonia.","Leitsalu, Liis; Alavere, Helene; Tammesoo, Mari-Liis; Leego, Erkki; Metspalu, Andres",Journal of personalized medicine,2015,,,"Estonian Genome Center, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, Tartu 51010, Estonia. liis.leitsalu@ut.ee.; Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Riia 23, Tartu 51010, Estonia. liis.leitsalu@ut.ee.; Estonian Genome Center, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, Tartu 51010, Estonia. helene.alavere@ut.ee.; Estonian Genome Center, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, Tartu 51010, Estonia. mari-liis.tammesoo@ut.ee.; Hansson, Leego & Partner, Turu 1, 51014 Tartu, Estonia. erkki.leego@hlp.ee.; Estonian Genome Center, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, Tartu 51010, Estonia. andres.metspalu@ut.ee.; Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Riia 23, Tartu 51010, Estonia. andres.metspalu@ut.ee.",10.3390/jpm5020096

Estonian Biobank,25339628,An epidemiological perspective of personalized medicine: the Estonian experience.,"The Estonian Biobank and several other biobanks established over a decade ago are now starting to yield valuable longitudinal follow-up data for large numbers of individuals. These samples have been used in hundreds of different genome-wide association studies, resulting in the identification of reliable disease-associated variants. The focus of genomic research has started to shift from identifying genetic and nongenetic risk factors associated with common complex diseases to understanding the underlying mechanisms of the diseases and suggesting novel targets for therapy. However, translation of findings from genomic research into medical practice is still lagging, mainly due to insufficient evidence of clinical validity and utility. In this review, we examine the different elements required for the implementation of personalized medicine based on genomic information. First, biobanks and genome centres are required and have been established for the high-throughput genomic screening of large numbers of samples. Secondly, the combination of susceptibility alleles into polygenic risk scores has improved risk prediction of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and several other diseases. Finally, national health information systems are being developed internationally, to combine data from electronic medical records from different sources, and also to gradually incorporate genomic information. We focus on the experience in Estonia, one of several countries with national goals towards more personalized health care based on genomic information, where the unique combination of elements required to accomplish this goal are already in place.","Milani, L; Leitsalu, L; Metspalu, A",Journal of internal medicine,2015,Biological Specimen Banks; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiovascular Diseases; Electronic Health Records; Estonia; Female; Genetic Testing; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Humans; Molecular Epidemiology; Precision Medicine,Estonia; biobanks; eHealth; electronic medical records; genomic medicine; personalized medicine,"Estonian Genome Center, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.",10.1111/joim.12320

Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic copper-accumulation disorder for which timely intervention is crucial, as treatment is readily available. We studied WD in the Estonian Biobank population to advance patient screening, swift diagnosis, and subsequent treatment. Combined analysis of genotype and phenotype data from electronic health records (EHRs) consolidated at the Estonian biobank led to the identification of 17 individuals at high risk of developing WD, who were recalled for further examination and deep phenotyping. All recall study participants, regardless of phenotype, age, and prior WD diagnosis, had low serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels, and 87% also exhibited signs of early to late neurodegeneration. The p.His1069Gln variant in ATP7B, a prevalent pathogenic mutation, showed a striking four- to five-fold enrichment in Estonians compared with other populations. Based on our analysis of genetic and nationwide health registry data, we estimate that WD remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in Estonia. Our study demonstrates that personalized medicine, implemented with the collaboration of medical professionals, has the potential to reduce the healthcare burden by facilitating the accurate diagnosis of rare genetic diseases. To our knowledge, this report is the first to describe a large-scale national biobank-based study of WD.","Nurm, Miriam; Reigo, Anu; Annilo, Tarmo; Toomsoo, Toomas; Nõukas, Margit; Nikopensius, Tiit; Pankratov, Vasili; Reisberg, Tuuli; Hudjashov, Georgi; Haller, Toomas; Tõnisson, Neeme",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2024,,,"Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia. miriam.nurm@ut.ee.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Confido Medical Center, Tartu, Estonia.; School of Natural Sciences and Health, Tallinn University, Tallinn, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Core Facility of Genomics, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Genetics and Personalized Medicine Clinic, Tartu University Hospital, Tartu, Estonia.",10.1038/s41431-024-01767-9

Early warning signals that are easy to detect and widely available can save lives. Estonia has one nation-wide Electronic Health Record (EHR) database for the storage of medical information of patients from hospitals and primary care providers. We extracted structured and unstructured data from the EHRs of participants of the Estonian Biobank (EstBB) and evaluated different formats of input data to understand how this continuously growing dataset should be prepared for best prediction. The utility of the EHR database for finding blood- and urine-based biomarkers for IS was demonstrated by applying different analytical and machine learning (ML) methods. Several early trends in common clinical laboratory parameter changes (set of red blood indices, lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio, etc.) were established for IS prediction. The developed ML models predicted the future occurrence of IS with very high accuracy and Random Forests was proved as the most applicable method to EHR data. We conclude that the EHR database and the risk factors uncovered are valuable resources in screening the population for risk of IS as well as constructing disease risk scores and refining prediction models for IS by ML.","Kurvits, Siim; Harro, Ainika; Reigo, Anu; Ott, Anne; Laur, Sven; Särg, Dage; Tampuu, Ardi; Alasoo, Kaur; Vilo, Jaak; Milani, Lili; Haller, Toomas",European journal of medical research,2023,Humans; Electronic Health Records; Ischemic Stroke; Estonia; Risk Factors; Biomarkers,Electronic health records; Ischemic stroke; Machine learning; Population health,"Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Software Technology and Applications Competence Center, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Software Technology and Applications Competence Center, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Software Technology and Applications Competence Center, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Software Technology and Applications Competence Center, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia. toomas.haller@ut.ee.",10.1186/s40001-023-01087-6
Estonian Biobank,37924579,The role of depression and antidepressant treatment in antihypertensive medication adherence and persistence: Utilising electronic health record data.,"Higher blood pressure levels in patients with depression may be associated with lower adherence to antihypertensive medications (AHMs). Here, we use electronic health record (EHR) data from the Estonian Biobank (EstBB) to investigate the role of lifetime depression in AHM adherence and persistence. We also explore the relationship between antidepressant initiation and intraindividual change in AHM adherence among hypertension (HTN) patients with newly diagnosed depression. Diagnosis and pharmacy refill data were obtained from the National Health Insurance database. Adherence and persistence to AHMs were determined for hypertension (HTN) patients initiating treatment between 2009 and 2017 with a three-year follow-up period. Multivariable regression was used to explore the associations between depression and AHM adherence or persistence, adjusting for sociodemographic, genetic, and health-related factors. A linear mixed-effects model was used to estimate the effect of antidepressant treatment initiation on antihypertensive medication adherence, adjusting for age and sex. We identified 20,724 individuals with newly diagnosed HTN (6294 depression cases and 14,430 controls). Depression was associated with 6% lower probability of AHM adherence (OR = 0.943, 95%CI = 0.909-0.979) and 12% lower odds of AHM persistence (OR = 0.876, 95%CI = 0.821-0.936). Adjusting for sociodemographic, genetic, and health-related factors did not significantly influence these associations. AHM adherence increased 8% six months after initiating antidepressant therapy (N = 132; β = 0.078; 95%CI = 0.025-0.131). Based on the EHR data on EstBB participants, depression is associated with lower AHM adherence and persistence. Additionally, antidepressant therapy may help improve AHM adherence in patients with depression.","Kariis, Hanna Maria; Kasela, Silva; Jürgenson, Tuuli; Saar, Aet; Lass, Jana; Krebs, Kristi; Võsa, Urmo; Haan, Elis; Milani, Lili; Lehto, Kelli",Journal of psychiatric research,2023,Humans; Antihypertensive Agents; Electronic Health Records; Depression; Medication Adherence; Hypertension; Antidepressive Agents; Retrospective Studies,Depression; Drug adherence; Drug persistence; Electronic health records; Hypertension; Polygenic risk score,"Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Riia 23B, Tartu, 51010, Tartumaa, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Riia 23B, Tartu, 51010, Tartumaa, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Riia 23B, Tartu, 51010, Tartumaa, Estonia.; North Estonia Medical Centre, J.

Estonian Biobank,39438584,Comorbidities confound metabolomics studies of human disease.,"The co-occurrence of multiple chronic conditions, termed multimorbidity, presents an expanding global health challenge, demanding effective diagnostics and treatment strategies. Chronic ailments such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases have been linked to metabolites interacting between the host and microbiota. In this study, we investigated the impact of co-existing conditions on risk estimations for 1375 plasma metabolites in 919 individuals from population-based Estonian Biobank cohort using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method. We leveraged annually linked national electronic health records (EHRs) data to delineate comorbidities in incident cases and controls for the 14 common chronic conditions. Among the 254 associations observed across 13 chronic conditions, we primarily identified disease-specific risk factors (92%, 217/235), with most predictors (93%, 219/235) found to be related to the gut microbiome upon cross-referencing recent literature data. Accounting for comorbidities led to a reduction of common metabolite predictors across various conditions. In conclusion, our study underscores the potential of utilizing biobank-linked retrospective and prospective EHRs for the disease-specific profiling of diverse multifactorial chronic conditions.","Jaagura, Madis; Kronberg, Jaanika; Reigo, Anu; Aasmets, Oliver; Nikopensius, Tiit; Võsa, Urmo; Bomba, Lorenzo; Estrada, Karol; Wuster, Arthur; Esko, Tõnu; Org, Elin",Scientific reports,2024,"Humans; Metabolomics; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Comorbidity; Aged; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Adult; Electronic Health Records; Chromatography, Liquid; Chronic Disease; Risk Factors; Estonia",Biobank; Chronic disease; Comorbidities; Electronic health records; Metabolomics; Risk factors,"Institute of Genomics, Estonian Genome Centre, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Genomics, Estonian Genome Centre, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Genomics, Estonian Genome Centre, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Genomics, Estonian Genome Centre, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Genomics, Estonian Genome Centre, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Genomics, Estonian Genome Centre, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Genomics, BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Novato, CA, USA.; Genomics, BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Novato, CA, USA.; Genomics, BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Novato, CA, USA.; Institute of Genomics, Estonian Genome Centre, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Genomics, Estonian Genome Centre, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia. elin.org@ut.ee.",10.1038/s41598-024-75556-1
Estonian Biobank,35169130,Gut metagenome associations with extensive digital health data in a volunteer-based Estonian microbiome cohort.,"Microbiome research is starting to move beyond the exploratory phase towards interventional trials and therefore well-characterized cohorts will be instrumental for generating hypotheses and providing new knowledge. As part of the Estonian Biobank, we established the Estonian Microbiome Cohort which includes stool, oral and plasma samples from 2509 participants and is supplemented with multi-omic measurements, questionnaires, and regular linkages to national electronic health records. Here we analyze stool data from deep metagenomic sequencing together with rich phenotyping, including 71 diseases, 136 medications, 21 dietary questions, 5 medical procedures, and 19 other factors. We identify numerous relationships (n = 3262) with different microbiome features. In this study, we extend the understanding of microbiome-host interactions using electronic health data and show that long-term antibiotic usage, independent from recent administration, has a significant impact on the microbiome composition, partly explaining the common associations between diseases.","Aasmets, Oliver; Krigul, Kertu Liis; Lüll, Kreete; Metspalu, Andres; Org, Elin",Nature communications,2022,"Anti-Bacterial Agents; Databases, Factual; Dysbiosis; Electronic Health Records; Estonia; Feces; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Metagenome; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Surveys and Questionnaires",,"Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia. elin.org@ut.ee.",10.1038/s41467-022-28464-9
Estonian Biobank,40162248,Association of Polygenic Risk for Psychiatric Disorders with Cardiometabolic Disease.,"Clinical diagnoses of psychiatric disorders are associated with cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) such as type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart diseases. Studying how genetic liability for psychiatric disorders relate to CMD risk will offer novel insight into the relationship between psychiatric disorders and CMDs. To evaluate the associations between psychiatric polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and clinically diagnosed CMDs while accounting for cross-disorder pleiotropy. This study computed PRSs for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The analysis was conducted in three population-based Northern European cohorts: the Swedish Twin Registry (STR, N=17,378 genotyped samples), the Estonian Biobank (EstBB, N=208,383), and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa, N=129,398). Associations between psychiatric PRSs and clinical diagnoses of 10 major CMDs (including metabolic diseases such as hyperlipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases such as hypertensive disease, arteriosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, cerebrovascular disease, and arrhythmias) were estimated using models that mutually adjusted for all psychiatric PRSs. Supplementary analyses were performed by additionally controlling for self-reported body mass index (BMI). A discordant twin-pair analysis was conducted in the STR (N=70,619) to assess the association between self-reported lifetime MDD and subsequent CMD risk while adjusting for familial factors shared between monozygotic and dizygotic co-twins. Psychiatric PRSs were constructed based on both all available genetic risk variants and genome-wide significant risk variants from large-scale GWASs. Clinical diagnoses of psychiatric disorders and CMDs were ascertained through electronic health records (with primary care records used exclusively in the EstBB). Lifetime self-reported MDD in the STR was assessed via the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form. PRSs for ADHD and MDD were associated with increased risk of all CMDs. The ADHD PRS showed stronger associations with metabolic disease, whereas the MDD PRS showed stronger associations with cardiovascular diseases. PRSs for anxiety disorder, PTSD, and bipolar disorder showed only limited associations with CMDs, while increased levels of schizophrenia PRSs were associated with decreased risk of CMDs. These associations remained after adjustment for BMI. Finally, twins endorsing lifetime MDD were found to have an increased risk of subsequent CMD diagnoses compared to their unexposed co-twins. PRSs for ADHD and MDD showed robust associations with risk of CMDs and self-reported MDD was associated with subsequent CMD risk even after adjusting for familial factors shared between co-twins. These findings provide robust evidence for genetic overlap between ADHD and MDD with CMDs.","Bergstedt, Jacob; Kõiv, Kadri; Jangmo, Andreas; Haram, Marit; Jaholkowski, Piotr P; Treur, Jorien L; Brikell, Isabell; Chang, Zheng; Larsson, Henrik; Magnusson, Patrik K E; McIntosh, Andrew M; Lewis, Cathryn M; Lee, Brian K; Sønderby, Ida E; Lu, Yi; Sullivan, Patrick F; Valdimarsdóttir, Unnur A; Andreassen, Ole; Tesli, Martin; Lehto, Kelli; Fang, Fang",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2025,,,"Unit of Integrative Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Department of Mental Health and Suicide, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway.; Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.; Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Center for Precision Psychiatry, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, Örebro University, Örebro, Sweden.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Royal Edinburgh Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.; Centre for Genomics and Experimental Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.; Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, King's College London, London, UK.; Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London, London, UK.; A.J.

Estonian Biobank,30420678,Genetic variation in the Estonian population: pharmacogenomics study of adverse drug effects using electronic health records.,"Pharmacogenomics aims to tailor pharmacological treatment to each individual by considering associations between genetic polymorphisms and adverse drug effects (ADEs). With technological advances, pharmacogenomic research has evolved from candidate gene analyses to genome-wide association studies. Here, we integrate deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) information with drug prescription and ADE data from Estonian electronic health record (EHR) databases to evaluate genome- and pharmacome-wide associations on an unprecedented scale. We leveraged WGS data of 2240 Estonian Biobank participants and imputed all single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) with allele counts over 2 for 13,986 genotyped participants. Overall, we identified 41 (10 novel) loss-of-function and 567 (134 novel) missense variants in 64 very important pharmacogenes. The majority of the detected variants were very rare with frequencies below 0.05%, and 6 of the novel loss-of-function and 99 of the missense variants were only detected as single alleles (allele count = 1). We also validated documented pharmacogenetic associations and detected new independent variants in known gene-drug pairs. Specifically, we found that CTNNA3 was associated with myositis and myopathies among individuals taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory oxicams and replicated this finding in an extended cohort of 706 individuals. These findings illustrate that population-based WGS-coupled EHRs are a useful tool for biomarker discovery.","Tasa, Tõnis; Krebs, Kristi; Kals, Mart; Mägi, Reedik; Lauschke, Volker M; Haller, Toomas; Puurand, Tarmo; Remm, Maido; Esko, Tõnu; Metspalu, Andres; Vilo, Jaak; Milani, Lili",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2019,"Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Electronic Health Records; Estonia; Humans; Loss of Function Mutation; Mutation Rate; Mutation, Missense; Pharmacogenomic Variants; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; alpha Catenin",,"Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, 50409, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, 51010, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, 51010, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, 51010, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, 51010, Estonia.; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Section of Pharmacogenetics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, 171 77, Sweden.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, 51010, Estonia.; Department of Bioinformatics, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Tartu, 51010, Estonia.; Department of Bioinformatics, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Tartu, 51010, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, 51010, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, 51010, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, 50409, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, 51010, Estonia. lili.milani@ut.ee.; Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, 751 44, Sweden. lili.milani@ut.ee.",10.1038/s41431-018-0300-6

Estonian Biobank,30978214,An exploratory phenome wide association study linking asthma and liver disease genetic variants to electronic health records from the Estonian Biobank.,"The Estonian Biobank, governed by the Institute of Genomics at the University of Tartu (Biobank), has stored genetic material/DNA and continuously collected data since 2002 on a total of 52,274 individuals representing ~5% of the Estonian adult population and is increasing. To explore the utility of data available in the Biobank, we conducted a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) in two areas of interest to healthcare researchers; asthma and liver disease. We used 11 asthma and 13 liver disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), identified from published genome-wide association studies, to test our ability to detect established associations. We confirmed 2 asthma and 5 liver disease associated variants at nominal significance and directionally consistent with published results. We found 2 associations that were opposite to what was published before (rs4374383:AA increases risk of NASH/NAFLD, rs11597086 increases ALT level). Three SNP-diagnosis pairs passed the phenome-wide significance threshold: rs9273349 and E06 (thyroiditis, p = 5.50x10-8); rs9273349 and E10 (type-1 diabetes, p = 2.60x10-7); and rs2281135 and K76 (non-alcoholic liver diseases, including NAFLD, p = 4.10x10-7). We have validated our approach and confirmed the quality of the data for these conditions.

We performed a GWAS of OSA in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system, where OSA prevalence is close to its true population prevalence. We performed GWAS of 568,576 MVP participants, stratified by biological sex and by harmonized race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry (HARE) groups of White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian individuals. We considered both BMI adjusted (BMI-adj) and unadjusted (BMI-unadj) models. We replicated associations in independent datasets, and analysed the heterogeneity of OSA genetic associations across HARE and sex groups. We finally performed a larger meta-analysis GWAS of MVP, FinnGen, and the MGB Biobank, totalling 916,696 individuals. MVP participants are 91% male. OSA prevalence is 21%. In MVP there were 18 and 6 genome-wide significant loci in BMI-unadj and BMI-adj analyses, respectively, corresponding to 21 association regions. Of these, 17 were not previously reported in association with OSA, and 13 replicated in FinnGen (False Discovery Rate p-value < 0.05). There were widespread significant differences in genetic effects between men and women, but less so across HARE groups. Meta-analysis of MVP, FinnGen, and MGB biobank revealed 17 additional, previously unreported, genome-wide significant regions. Sex differences in genetic associations with OSA are widespread, likely associated with multiple OSA risk factors. OSA shares genetic underpinnings with several sleep phenotypes, suggesting shared aetiology and causal pathways.

To leverage the wealth of information provided, algorithms are required that systematically translate the contained information into treatment recommendations based on existing genotype-phenotype associations. We developed and tested algorithms for translation of preexisting genotype data of over 44,000 participants of the Estonian biobank into pharmacogenetic recommendations. We compared the results obtained by genome sequencing, exome sequencing, and genotyping using microarrays, and evaluated the impact of pharmacogenetic reporting based on drug prescription statistics in the Nordic countries and Estonia. Our most striking result was that the performance of genotyping arrays is similar to that of genome sequencing, whereas exome sequencing is not suitable for pharmacogenetic predictions. Interestingly, 99.8% of all assessed individuals had a genotype associated with increased risks to at least one medication, and thereby the implementation of pharmacogenetic recommendations based on genotyping affects at least 50 daily drug doses per 1000 inhabitants. We find that microarrays are a cost-effective solution for creating preemptive pharmacogenetic reports, and with slight modifications, existing databases can be applied for automated pharmacogenetic decision support for clinicians.","Reisberg, Sulev; Krebs, Kristi; Lepamets, Maarja; Kals, Mart; Mägi, Reedik; Metsalu, Kristjan; Lauschke, Volker M; Vilo, Jaak; Milani, Lili",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2019,"Algorithms; Biological Specimen Banks; Databases, Factual; Electronic Health Records; Estonia; Genetic Testing; Genotype; Humans; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Pharmacogenetics; Pharmacogenomic Testing; Pharmacogenomic Variants; Phenotype; Precision Medicine; Sequence Analysis, DNA",biobank participants; genotyping array; pharmacogenetics; pharmacogenomics; preemptive pharmacogenetic testing,"Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; STACC, Tartu, Estonia.; Quretec, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Section of Pharmacogenetics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; STACC, Tartu, Estonia.; Quretec, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia. lili.milani@ut.ee.; Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. lili.milani@ut.ee.",10.1038/s41436-018-0337-5
Estonian Biobank,39792440,Genome-wide association study of varenicline-aided smoking cessation.,"Varenicline is an α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist with the highest therapeutic efficacy of any pharmacological smoking cessation aid and a 12-month cessation rate of 26%. Genetic variation may be associated with varenicline response, but to date no genome-wide association studies of varenicline response have been published. In this study, we investigated the genetic contribution to varenicline effectiveness using two electronic health record-derived phenotypes. We defined short-term varenicline effectiveness (SVE) and long-term varenicline effectiveness (LVE) by assessing smoking status at 3 and 12 months, respectively, after initiating varenicline treatment. In Stage 1, comprising five European cohort studies, we tested genome-wide associations with SVE (1,405 cases, 2,074 controls) and LVE (1,576 cases, 2,555 controls), defining sentinel variants (the most strongly associated variant within 1 megabase) with p-value <5×10-6 to follow up in Stage 2. In Stage 2, we tested association between sentinel variants and comparable smoking cessation endpoints in varenicline randomised controlled trials. We subsequently meta-analysed Stages 1 and 2. No variants reached genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis. In Stage 1, 10 sentinel variants were associated with SVE and five with LVE at a suggestive significance threshold (p-value <5×10-6); none of these sentinels were previously implicated in varenicline-aided smoking cessation or in genetic studies of smoking behaviour. We provide initial insights into the biological underpinnings of varenicline-aided smoking cessation, through implicating genes involved in various processes, including gene expression, cilium assembly and early-stage development. Leveraging electronic health records, we undertook the largest genetic study of varenicline-aided smoking cessation to date, and the only such study to test genome-wide associations. We showed distinct genetic variants associated (p-value <5×10-6) with varenicline-aided smoking cessation which implicate diverse cellular functions, including transcriptional regulation, RNA modification and cilium assembly. These provide insights which, if independently corroborated, will improve understanding of varenicline response. The growing availability of biobank resources with genetic and varenicline response data will provide future opportunities for larger studies using the approach we developed.","Coley, Kayesha; Wang, Qingning; Packer, Richard; John, Catherine; Abner, Erik; Reis, Kadri; Bedair, Khaled F; Srinivasan, Sundararajan; Paciga, Sara; Hyde, Craig; Free, Robert C; Reeve, Nicola F; Shepherd, David J; Esko, Tõnu; Palmer, Colin; Pearson, Ewan; Malarstig, Anders; Tobin, Martin D; Batini, Chiara",Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,2025,,Varenicline; electronic health records; genetic epidemiology; nicotine dependence; pharmacogenomics; smoking cessation,"Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Groby Road, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Groby Road, Leicester, UK.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Pat Macpherson Centre for Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics, Division of Population Health and Genomics, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.; Pat Macpherson Centre for Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics, Division of Population Health and Genomics, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.; Pfizer Worldwide Research, Development and Medical, USA.; Pfizer Worldwide Research, Development and Medical, USA.; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Groby Road, Leicester, UK.; School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.; Pat Macpherson Centre for Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics, Division of Population Health and Genomics, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.; Pat Macpherson Centre for Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics, Division of Population Health and Genomics, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.; Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.; Pfizer Worldwide Research, Development and Medical, Stockholm, Sweden.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Groby Road, Leicester, UK.; Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Groby Road, Leicester, UK.",10.1093/ntr/ntaf009

Heart J., 2013, 34 (45), 3478-3490). Untreated FH leads to lifelong elevated LDL cholesterol levels, which can cause ischemic heart disease, with potentially fatal consequences at a relatively early age.

Estonian Biobank,39426992,Nationwide study on development and validation of a risk prediction model for CIN3+ and cervical cancer in Estonia.,"Transitioning to an individualized risk-based approach can significantly enhance cervical cancer screening programs. We aimed to derive and internally validate a prediction model for assessing the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or higher (CIN3+) and cancer in women eligible for screening. This retrospective study utilized data from the Estonian electronic health records, including 517,884 women from the health insurance database and linked health registries. We employed Cox proportional hazard regression, incorporating reproductive and medical history variables (14 covariates), and utilized the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for variable selection. A 10-fold cross-validation for internal validation of the model was used. The main outcomes were the performance of discrimination and calibration. Over the 8-year follow-up, we identified 1326 women with cervical cancer and 5929 with CIN3+, with absolute risks of 0.3% and 1.1%, respectively. The prediction model for CIN3 + and cervical cancer had good discriminative power and was well calibrated Harrell's C of 0.74 (0.73-0.74) (calibration slope 1.00 (0.97-1.02) and 0.67 (0.66-0.69) (calibration slope 0.92 (0.84-1.00) respectively.

Here, we combined data on antidepressant non-response measured using rating scales for depressive symptoms, questionnaires of treatment effect, and data from electronic health records, to increase statistical power to detect genomic loci associated with non-response to antidepressants in a total sample of 135,471 individuals prescribed antidepressants (25,255 non-responders and 110,216 responders). We performed genome-wide association meta-analyses, genetic correlation analyses, leave-one-out polygenic prediction, and bioinformatics analyses for genetically informed drug prioritization. We identified two novel loci (rs1106260 and rs60847828) associated with non-response to antidepressants and showed significant polygenic prediction in independent samples. Genetic correlation analyses show positive associations between non-response to antidepressants and most psychiatric traits, and negative associations with cognitive traits and subjective well-being. In addition, we investigated drugs that target proteins likely involved in mechanisms underlying antidepressant non-response, and shortlisted drugs that warrant further replication and validation of their potential to reduce depressive symptoms in individuals who do not respond to first-line antidepressant medications. These results suggest that meta-analyses of GWAS utilizing real-world measures of treatment outcomes can increase sample sizes to improve the discovery of variants associated with non-response to antidepressants.","Koch, Elise; Jürgenson, Tuuli; Einarsson, Guðmundur; Mitchell, Brittany; Harder, Arvid; García-Marín, Luis M; Krebs, Kristi; Lin, Yuhao; Shadrin, Alexey; Xiong, Ying; Frei, Oleksandr; Lu, Yi; Hägg, Sara; Renteria, Miguel; Medland, Sarah; Wray, Naomi; Martin, Nicholas; Hübel, Christopher; Breen, Gerome; Thorgeirsson, Thorgeir; Stefansson, Hreinn; Stefansson, Kari; Lehto, Kelli; Milani, Lili; Andreassen, Ole; O Connell, Kevin",Research square,2024,,Antidepressants; genetics-informed drug repurposing; genome-wide association study; pharmacogenomics; precision medicine; real-world data,"Centre for Precision Psychiatry, University of Oslo.; QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute.; Estonian Genome Center,Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu.; University of Oslo.; Karolinska Institute.; University of Oslo.; Karolinska Institutet.; Karolinska Institutet.; QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute.; QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute.; University of Oxford.; QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute.; King's College London.; deCODE genetics / Amgen Inc.; deCODE genetics.; deCODE Genetics/Amgen, Inc.; University of Tartu.; Oslo University Hospital & Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo.",10.21203/rs.3.rs-5418279/v1
Estonian Biobank,29706349,Haplotype Sharing Provides Insights into Fine-Scale Population History and Disease in Finland.,"Finland provides unique opportunities to investigate population and medical genomics because of its adoption of unified national electronic health records, detailed historical and birth records, and serial population bottlenecks. We assembled a comprehensive view of recent population history (≤100 generations), the timespan during which most rare-disease-causing alleles arose, by comparing pairwise haplotype sharing from 43,254 Finns to that of 16,060 Swedes, Estonians, Russians, and Hungarians from geographically and linguistically adjacent countries with different population histories. We find much more extensive sharing in Finns, with at least one ≥ 5 cM tract on average between pairs of unrelated individuals. By coupling haplotype sharing with fine-scale birth records from more than 25,000 individuals, we find that although haplotype sharing broadly decays with geographical distance, there are pockets of excess haplotype sharing; individuals from northeast Finland typically share several-fold more of their genome in identity-by-descent segments than individuals from southwest regions. We estimate recent effective population-size changes through time across regions of Finland, and we find that there was more continuous gene flow as Finns migrated from southwest to northeast between the early- and late-settlement regions than was dichotomously described previously. Lastly, we show that haplotype sharing is locally enriched by an order of magnitude among pairs of individuals sharing rare alleles and especially among pairs sharing rare disease-causing variants. Our work provides a general framework for using haplotype sharing to reconstruct an integrative view of recent population history and gain insight into the evolutionary origins of rare variants contributing to disease.","Martin, Alicia R; Karczewski, Konrad J; Kerminen, Sini; Kurki, Mitja I; Sarin, Antti-Pekka; Artomov, Mykyta; Eriksson, Johan G; Esko, Tõnu; Genovese, Giulio; Havulinna, Aki S; Kaprio, Jaakko; Konradi, Alexandra; Korányi, László; Kostareva, Anna; Männikkö, Minna; Metspalu, Andres; Perola, Markus; Prasad, Rashmi B; Raitakari, Olli; Rotar, Oxana; Salomaa, Veikko; Groop, Leif; Palotie, Aarno; Neale, Benjamin M; Ripatti, Samuli; Pirinen, Matti; Daly, Mark J",American journal of human genetics,2018,"Disease; Finland; Gene Flow; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Haplotypes; Human Migration; Humans; Parturition; Population Density; Time Factors",Finland; haplotypes; human history; population genetics; rare variants,"Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA; Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.

Estonian Biobank,40579431,Genetic influences on antidepressant side effects: a CYP2C19 gene variation and polygenic risk study in the Estonian Biobank.,"Antidepressant side effects are prevalent, leading to significant treatment discontinuity among patients. A deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms could help identify individuals at risk of side effects and improve treatment outcomes.We aim to investigate the role of genetic variation in CYP2C19 and polygenic scores (PGS) for psychiatric and side effect-related phenotypes in experiencing antidepressant side effects.We pooled Estonian Biobank data from the Mental Health online Survey (N = 86,244), the Adverse Drug Events Questionnaire (N = 49,366) and from unstructured electronic health records using natural language processing (N = 206,066) covering 25 common side effects. The results were meta-analysed with previously published results from the Australian Genetics of Depression Study. Among 13,729 antidepressant users, 52.0% reported side effects. In a subgroup of 9,563 individuals taking antidepressants metabolised by CYP2C19, poor metabolisers had 49% higher odds of reporting a side effect (OR = 1.49, 95%CI = 1.09-2.04), while ultrarapid metabolisers had 17% lower odds (OR = 0.83, 95%CI = 0.70-0.99) compared to normal metabolisers. PGSs for schizophrenia and depression showed the most associations with overall and specific side effects. PGSs for higher body mass index (BMI), anxiety, and systolic blood pressure were associated with respective side effects among any antidepressant and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) users. Meta-analysis confirmed robust evidence linking a higher BMI PGS and weight gain across nine antidepressants and moderate evidence linking PGS for headache with headache from sertraline. Our findings underscore the role of genetic factors in experiencing antidepressant side effects and have potential implications for personalised medicine approaches to improve antidepressant treatment outcomes.","Kariis, Hanna Maria; Särg, Dage; Krebs, Kristi; Jõeloo, Maarja; Kõiv, Kadri; Sirts, Kairit; Alver, Maris; Lehto, Kelli; Milani, Lili",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2025,,,"Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia. lili.milani@ut.ee.",10.1038/s41431-025-01894-x
Estonian Biobank,40069276,Pathway level metabolomics analysis identifies carbon metabolism as a key factor of incident hypertension in the Estonian Biobank.,"The purpose of this study was to find metabolic changes associated with incident hypertension in the volunteer-based Estonian Biobank. We used a subcohort of the Estonian Biobank where metabolite levels had been measured by mass-spectrometry (LC-MS, Metabolon platform). We divided annotated metabolites of 989 individuals into KEGG pathways, followed by principal component analysis of metabolites in each pathway, resulting in a dataset of 91 pathway components. Next, we defined incident hypertension cases and controls based on electronic health records, resulting in a dataset of 101 incident hypertension cases and 450 controls. We used Cox proportional hazards models and replicated the results in a separate cohort of the Estonian Biobank, assayed with LC-MS dataset of the Broad platform and including 582 individuals. Our results show that body mass index and a component of the carbon metabolism KEGG pathway are associated with incident hypertension in both discovery and replication cohorts. We demonstrate that a high-dimensional dataset can be meaningfully reduced into informative pathway components that can subsequently be analysed in an interpretable way, and replicated in a metabolomics dataset from a different platform.","Hiie, Liis; Kolde, Anastassia; Pervjakova, Natalia; Reigo, Anu; Abner, Erik; Võsa, Urmo; Esko, Tõnu; Fischer, Krista; Palta, Priit; Kronberg, Jaanika",Scientific reports,2025,Humans; Estonia; Metabolomics; Male; Female; Hypertension; Middle Aged; Carbon; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Biological Specimen Banks; Aged; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Incidence; Body Mass Index,Biobank; Data-driven; Hypertension; Incident disease; Metabolomics; Pathways,"Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, 51010, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Tartu, Narva 18, 51009, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, 51010, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Tartu, Narva 18, 51009, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, 51010, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, 51010, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, 51010, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, 51010, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, 51010, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, 51010, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Tartu, Narva 18, 51009, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, 51010, Tartu, Estonia.; Estonian Genome Centre, Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu, Riia 23b, 51010, Tartu, Estonia. jaanika.kronberg@ut.ee.",10.1038/s41598-025-92840-w

Estonian Biobank,40101227,Using Synthetic Health Care Data to Leverage Large Language Models for Named Entity Recognition: Development and Validation Study.,"Named entity recognition (NER) plays a vital role in extracting critical medical entities from health care records, facilitating applications such as clinical decision support and data mining. Developing robust NER models for low-resource languages, such as Estonian, remains a challenge due to the scarcity of annotated data and domain-specific pretrained models. Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be promising in understanding text from any language or domain. This study addresses the development of medical NER models for low-resource languages, specifically Estonian. We propose a novel approach by generating synthetic health care data and using LLMs to annotate them. These synthetic data are then used to train a high-performing NER model, which is applied to real-world medical texts, preserving patient data privacy. Our approach to overcoming the shortage of annotated Estonian health care texts involves a three-step pipeline: (1) synthetic health care data are generated using a locally trained GPT-2 model on Estonian medical records, (2) the synthetic data are annotated with LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, and (3) the annotated synthetic data are then used to fine-tune an NER model, which is later tested on real-world medical data. This paper compares the performance of different prompts; assesses the impact of GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and a local LLM; and explores the relationship between the amount of annotated synthetic data and model performance. The proposed methodology demonstrates significant potential in extracting named entities from real-world medical texts. Our top-performing setup achieved an F This paper demonstrates a successful approach to leveraging LLMs for training NER models using synthetic data, effectively preserving patient privacy. By avoiding reliance on human-annotated data, our method shows promise in developing models for low-resource languages, such as Estonian. Future work will focus on refining the synthetic data generation and expanding the method's applicability to other domains and languages.","Šuvalov, Hendrik; Lepson, Mihkel; Kukk, Veronika; Malk, Maria; Ilves, Neeme; Kuulmets, Hele-Andra; Kolde, Raivo",Journal of medical Internet research,2025,Humans; Natural Language Processing; Data Mining; Electronic Health Records; Estonia; Large Language Models,Estonian; LLM; NER; NLP; annotated data; artificial intelligence; clinical decision support; data annotation; data mining; health care data; language model; large language model; machine learning; medical entity; named entity recognition; natural language processing; synthetic data,"Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.; Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.",10.2196/66279
Estonian Biobank,25282103,Defining the role of common variation in the genomic and biological architecture of adult human height.,"Using genome-wide data from 253,288 individuals, we identified 697 variants at genome-wide significance that together explained one-fifth of the heritability for adult height. By testing different numbers of variants in independent studies, we show that the most strongly associated ∼2,000, ∼3,700 and ∼9,500 SNPs explained ∼21%, ∼24% and ∼29% of phenotypic variance. Furthermore, all common variants together captured 60% of heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci were enriched for genes, pathways and tissue types known to be involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways not highlighted in earlier efforts, such as signaling by fibroblast growth factors, WNT/β-catenin and chondroitin sulfate-related genes. We identified several genes and pathways not previously connected with human skeletal growth, including mTOR, osteoglycin and binding of hyaluronic acid. Our results indicate a genetic architecture for human height that is characterized by a very large but finite number (thousands) of causal variants.","Wood, Andrew R; Esko, Tonu; Yang, Jian; Vedantam, Sailaja;

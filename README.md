# 17-EHR

This repository supports a high-impact review article titled **"Challenges and Opportunities Using Global EHR Linked Biobanks"**, invited for Volume 9 of the *Annual Review of Biomedical Data Science (2026)*. It includes code and data to characterize and visualize the global literature landscape of major biobank initiatives.

## üß† Project Goal

To systematically examine the scientific landscape of research utilizing five major biobank initiatives, with a focus on understanding research themes, temporal trends, and comparative research activity. This analysis provides foundational data for understanding the global impact and research directions of major biobanking efforts.

* UK Biobank
* All of Us (US)
* FinnGen (Finland)
* Estonian Biobank
* Million Veteran Program (MVP, US)

## üîç Methods Overview

To generate the literature corpus used throughout this repository, we conducted a systematic search of PubMed using the NCBI Entrez API between 2000 and 2024. The search strategy focused specifically on identifying all published research that mentions any of the five major biobank initiatives by name, prioritizing published, peer-reviewed articles while systematically excluding preprints to ensure research quality and validity.

### Data Collection Strategy

**PubMed Query Period**: 2000‚Äì2024 (2025 excluded as incomplete year)

**Search Methodology**: 
- **Biobank-Specific Name Searches**: Individual searches for each target biobank using exact names and known aliases
- **No Thematic Filtering**: Comprehensive retrieval of ALL papers mentioning target biobanks regardless of research topic
- **Simple Boolean Logic**: Biobank names OR aliases + date range constraints only

**Target Biobanks and Search Terms**:
- **UK Biobank**: "UK Biobank", "United Kingdom Biobank", "U.K. Biobank", "UK-Biobank"
- **Million Veteran Program**: "Million Veteran Program", "Million Veterans Program", "MVP biobank", "MVP cohort", "MVP genomics", "Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program", "VA Million Veteran Program"
- **FinnGen**: "FinnGen", "FinnGen biobank", "FinnGen study", "FinnGen cohort", "FinnGen consortium"
- **All of Us**: "All of Us Research Program", "All of Us cohort", "All of Us biobank", "AoU Research Program", "Precision Medicine Initiative cohort"
- **Estonian Biobank**: "Estonian Biobank", "Estonia Biobank", "Estonian Genome Center", "Estonian Health Cohort", "Tartu Biobank"

**Quality Assurance**:
- ‚úÖ **Preprint Exclusion**: Systematic filtering of medRxiv, bioRxiv, Research Square, arXiv, and other preprint servers (applied post-retrieval)
- ‚úÖ **Published Papers Only**: Focus on peer-reviewed, formally published research
- ‚úÖ **Complete Year Analysis**: 2025 excluded to prevent bias from incomplete data
- ‚úÖ **Date-based Chunking**: Year-by-year (and month-by-month when needed) retrieval to bypass PubMed's 9,999 record limit
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Coverage**: No topic restrictions - captures all research domains mentioning target biobanks

### Technical Implementation

**Search Query Structure**:
```
(biobank_terms) AND ("YEAR"[PDAT])
```
Where `biobank_terms` = `"Term1"[All Fields] OR "Term2"[All Fields] OR ...`

**Scalability Approach**:
- **Primary Strategy**: Year-by-year searches (2000-2024)
- **Fallback Strategy**: Month-by-month searches when yearly results exceed 9,999 records
- **Rate Limiting**: 0.34-second delays between API calls to respect NCBI guidelines
- **Batch Processing**: 100-record batches for metadata retrieval

### Data Processing Pipeline

**Deduplication Strategy**: 
- Articles mentioning multiple biobanks appear once per biobank in raw data
- PMID-based deduplication creates unique article dataset
- Both raw and deduplicated datasets preserved for different analyses

**Metadata Extraction**:
- **Bibliographic Data**: Titles, abstracts, journals, publication years
- **Indexing Terms**: MeSH terms (Medical Subject Headings)
- **Identifiers**: PubMed IDs (PMIDs) for cross-referencing
- **Biobank Attribution**: Which biobank(s) each paper mentions

**Output Datasets**:
- `biobank_research_data.csv`: Raw data with potential duplicates across biobanks
- `biobank_research_data_deduplicated.csv`: Unique papers (PMID-based deduplication)

The resulting dataset captures the complete landscape of published research mentioning these major biobank initiatives, providing comprehensive coverage for bibliometric and trend analyses.

### Preprint Filtering Methodology

To ensure research quality, we implemented comprehensive preprint detection and exclusion:

**Excluded Sources**:
- medRxiv, bioRxiv, Research Square
- arXiv, ChemRxiv, PeerJ Preprints
- F1000Research, OSF Preprints
- Any journal containing "preprint", "working paper", or similar terms

**Filtering Statistics**: 
- Detailed breakdown of excluded preprints by source
- Transparency reporting on filtering impact
- Comparative analysis of published vs. preprint distributions
